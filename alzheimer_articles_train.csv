40041886,Drofenine as a Kv2.1 inhibitor alleviated AD-like pathology in mice through Aβ/Kv2.1/microglial NLRP3/neuronal Tau axis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with clinical hallmarks of progressive cognitive impairment. Synergistic effects of the Aβ-Tau cascade reaction are tightly implicated in AD pathology, and microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation drives neuronal tauopathy. However, the underlying mechanism of how Aβ mediates NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. Herein, we determined that oligomeric Aβ (o-Aβ) bound to microglial Kv2.1 and promoted Kv2.1-dependent potassium efflux to activate NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in neuronal tauopathy by using Kv2.1 inhibitor drofenine (Dfe) as a probe. The underlying mechanism has been intensively investigated by assays with Kv2.1 knockdown in vitro (si-Kv2.1) and in vivo (AAV-ePHP-si-Kv2.1). Dfe deprived o-Aβ of its capability to promote microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuronal Tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting the Kv2.1/JNK/NF-κB pathway while improving the cognitive impairment of 5×FAD-AD model mice. Our results have highly addressed that the Kv2.1 channel is required for o-Aβ-driven microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuronal tauopathy in AD model mice and highlighted that Dfe as a Kv2.1 inhibitor shows potential in the treatment of AD.",Acta Pharm Sin B
40089786,Do microglia metabolize fructose in Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder with a complex etiology. While emerging AD therapeutics can slow cognitive decline, they may worsen dementia in certain groups of individuals. Therefore, alternative treatments are much needed. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, have the potential to be novel therapeutic targets as they regulate many facets of AD, including lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance, and neuroinflammation. To carry out such functions, microglia undergo phenotypic changes, which are linked to shifts in metabolism and substrate utilization. While homeostatic microglia are driven by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, in aging and AD, microglia shift further towards glycolysis. Interestingly, this ""metabolic reprogramming"" may be linked to an increase in fructose metabolism. In the brain, microglia predominantly express the fructose transporter SLC2A5 (GLUT5), and enzymes involved in fructolysis and endogenous fructose production, with their expression being upregulated in aging and disease. Here, we review evidence for fructose uptake, breakdown, and production in microglia. We also evaluate emerging literature targeting fructose metabolism in the brain and periphery to assess its ability to modulate microglial function in AD. The ability of microglia to transport and utilize fructose, coupled with the well-established role of fructose in metabolic dysfunction, supports the notion that microglial fructose metabolism may be a novel potential therapeutic target for AD.",J Neuroinflammation
39994993,Alzheimer's disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Current perspectives and genetic insights.,"The prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive disorder has markedly risen in recent years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands out as the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia among the elderly, featuring progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Although the exact biological causes of AD are complex and multifactorial, genetics is considered a prominent contributor. To date, around 80 genetic loci have been identified, primarily in European ancestry groups, though a considerable portion of AD's genetic architecture remains elusive. Recognizing the impending rise in AD cases, both governmental and private sectors in Saudi Arabia are making efforts to enhance formal care and services for older adults. While few studies have investigated AD-susceptible genes within the Saudi population, further attention is needed to explore the genetic background and identify molecular biomarkers associated with AD. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of AD and recent genetic research in Saudi Arabia.",J Alzheimers Dis
39975470,Characterization of plasma AT(N) biomarkers among a racial and ethnically diverse community-based cohort: an HABS-HD study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers of Amyloid(A), Tau(T), and Neurodegeneration(N) have been increasingly studied to fill the gap in our understanding of racial and ethnic differences. This study aimed to examine the relationship between plasma AT(N) biomarkers and (1) AT(N) neuroimaging biomarkers, (2) demographics, (3) medical comorbidities, and (4) cognitive diagnosis.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from n = 764 non-Hispanic Black (NHB), n = 1230 Hispanic, and n = 1232 non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants. Plasma AT(N) biomarkers were derived using single molecule array (SIMOA) technology on an HD-X imager and included amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40, total tau, ptau181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Clinical reads of positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau positivity were used to examine the link between AT(N) plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers. Generalized linear models were conducted to examine the relationship between plasma AT(N) biomarkers and select demographic, diagnostic, and medical comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease).
RESULTS: Differences in the AT(N) biomarkers were found across racial/ethnic groups. Plasma Aβ42/40 was found to be associated with PET amyloid positivity only among NHW participants, while plasma NfL was found to correlate with Meta-ROI among NHB and Hispanic participants. Ptau181 was associated with PET amyloid positivity among NHB and NHW participants and well as PET tau positivity among the latter group and Hispanic participants. Diabetes was related to increased plasma AT(N) biomarkers among NHB and Hispanic participants. CKD was associated with increased AT(N) biomarkers for all race/ethnic groups with the exception of Aβ42/40. While Aβ42/40, total tau, ptau181, and NfL were found to be related to a dementia diagnosis among NHW participants, only ptau181 and NfL were found to be related to this same diagnostic category among NHB and Hispanic participants.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate differential relationships between comorbidities (demographic, medical, diagnostic) across NHB, Hispanic, and NHW participants. This work expands our knowledge regarding the associations of plasma biomarkers to AD pathology in diverse populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Differences in AT(N) plasma biomarkers were found in a diverse community cohort.While plasma Aβ42/40 was associated with PET amyloid positivity among non-Hispanic white participants, this did not apply to non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic participants.Medical comorbidity of diabetes and chronic kidney disease was related to increased plasma AT(N) biomarkers among the ethnically diverse segment of the cohort.Plasma AT(N) biomarkers were more so related to a diagnosis of dementia for non-Hispanic white as compared to Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black participants.Across racial/ethnic groups, the plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration (NfL) and ptau181 were related to a diagnosis of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40131549,The role of low-level laser therapy in Alzheimer's disease: a review of the potential benefits of vitamin D enhancement.,"As the global population ages, neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), have become a major public health concern. AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for 60-80% of cases, and is characterized by progressive cognitive and memory decline due to neuronal loss. Current pharmacological treatments primarily offer symptomatic relief rather than a cure. Recent research has highlighted the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection, owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, as well as its ability to maintain blood-brain barrier integrity and regulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance. Another emerging noninvasive therapeutic approach is Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), a form of photobiomodulation (PBM) that has been shown to enhance neuronal function, reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and Aβ deposition, and potentially increase vitamin D levels. This review examines the interplay between LLLT, vitamin D, and oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology. Findings suggest that LLLT can stimulate mitochondrial function, enhance synaptic plasticity, and improve cognitive performance in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, LLLT has been reported to modulate immune responses, promote neurogenesis, and facilitate vitamin D synthesis by activating cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial energy production. However, while promising, further in vivo and clinical trials are required to optimize treatment protocols and establish standardized guidelines for LLLT application, particularly in enhancing vitamin D levels, in AD patients.

39985973,The up-regulation of PTBP1 expression level in patients with Insomnia by senile dementia and promote cuproptosis of nerve cell by SLC31A1.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), often referred to as the modern-day scourge, stands as a significant health challenge characterized by high rates of disability and mortality, particularly among the geriatric population. Thus, the present study investigated the precise details of PTBP1 involvement in cuproptosis of nerve cell of patients with Insomnia by senile dementia (ISD). Patients with ISD, early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and Normal healthy volunteers were obtained. In the context of ISD, the elevated PTBP1 mRNA expressions were observed in patient samples, correlating positively with diminished cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and increased geriatric depression scale scores. The pivotal role of PTBP1 was further underscored by its inhibitory effects in a mice model, which prevented the development of senile dementia, and its influence on neuronal cell proliferation and ROS-induced oxidative stress in vitro. Additionally, PTBP1's regulatory capacity on the cuproptosis of nerve cells and its modulation of SLC31A1 expression, through effects on ubiquitination, were revealed. The stability of PTBP1, critical for its function, was enhanced by the m6A modification mediated by METTL3, highlighting a complex regulatory network in the pathogenesis of ISD. These data confirmed that PTBP1 plays a pivotal role in promoting the oxidative response and cuproptosis in Alzheimer's disease models via the SLC31A1 pathway. The findings suggest that PTBP1 could serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of ISD and AD, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this protein.",Sleep Med
40090246,An activatable β-diketonate europium(III) complex-based probe for time-gated luminescence detection and imaging of peroxynitrite in vitro and in vivo.,"Peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>), one of representative reactive nitrogen species with strong oxidative and nitrative properties, is known to be associated with various human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), inflammation, and cancer. Probing its fluctuations throughout diseases holds profound promise for advancing early diagnosis and enabling prompt intervention. In this work, we designed and synthesized a β-diketonate Eu<sup>3+</sup> complex-based probe, [Eu(Cy-CDHH)<sub>3</sub>(terpy)], for the time-gated luminescence (TGL) detection of ONOO<sup>-</sup>. The probe, composed of a cyanine-dye-conjugated β-diketonate-Eu<sup>3+</sup> coordination structure, is non-luminescent due to the intramolecular energy transfer from β-diketonate to cyanine-dye, which inhibits the energy transfer from β-diketonate to central Eu<sup>3+</sup> ion. Upon reaction with ONOO<sup>-</sup>, the unsaturated CC bond of cyanine-dye is cleaved. This process leads to the recovery of the intense long-lived luminescence of the β-diketonate-Eu<sup>3+</sup> complex (ϕ = 17.3 %, τ = 436 μs), showcasing characteristics of rapid response (within 10 s), high selectivity, low detection limit (17.4 nM), and low cytotoxicity. These features enable the probe to be used for the quantitative TGL detection of ONOO<sup>-</sup> in aqueous media as well as for the background-free TGL imaging of ONOO<sup>-</sup> in living cells under assorted stimuli. Furthermore, the probe was effectively implemented for imaging of ONOO<sup>-</sup> in livers of drug-induced liver injury mice, revealing the up-regulation of ONOO<sup>-</sup> levels in this disease and the therapeutic efficacy of glutathione (GSH) via precluding the onset of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. This research paves a new way for the fabrication of lanthanide complex bioprobes, providing a useful tool for understanding the interconnection between ONOO<sup>-</sup> and disease-related physiological processes.",Talanta

39976252,Usability of the Mayo Test Drive remote self-administered web-based cognitive screening battery in adults aged 35-100 with and without cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Mayo Test Drive (MTD): Mayo Test Development through Rapid Iteration, Validation and Expansion, is a web-based remote cognitive assessment platform for self-administered neuropsychological measures with previously demonstrated validity and reliability. We examined the usability of MTD and hypothesized that completion rates would be greater than 90%. We explored whether completion and participation rates differed by cognitive status and demographic factors.
METHODS: A total of 1,950 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants (97% White, 99% Non-Hispanic) were invited to participate in this ancillary, uncompensated remote study. Most invitees were cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 1,769; 90.7%) and 9.3% were cognitively impaired (CI; n = 181). Usability was objectively defined as the percentage of participants who completed a session after initiating a session for a given timepoint (i.e. completion rates).
RESULTS: Baseline session completion rates were 98.5% (n = 1199/1217 participants, mean age 71, SD = 12, range 35-100) and were comparable between CU (98.7%) and CI (95.0%) groups (p = .23). Completion rates did not significantly differ by age groups (p &gt; .10) and remained high in individuals 80+ (n = 251, 97.3%). Participation rates were higher in the CU (n = 1142, 65.4%) versus CI (n = 57, 33.1%) group (p &lt; .001); participants were younger and had more years of education (p's &lt; .001). Adherence (i.e. retention) rate for a 7.5-month follow-up session was 89%. Average session duration was 16 min. Most participants used a personal computer (62.7%), followed by a smartphone (22.2%) or tablet (14.8%). Comments entered by 36.4% of participants reflected several themes including acceptability, face validity, usability, and comments informative for session context.
CONCLUSIONS: MTD demonstrated high usability as defined by completion rates in this research sample that includes a broad age range, though participation rates are lower in individuals with cognitive impairment. Results support good adherence at follow-up, feasibility through mean session duration, and acceptability based on qualitative analysis of participant comments.",J Clin Exp Neuropsychol
40122087,"Three decades of population health changes in Japan, 1990-2021: a subnational analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","BACKGROUND: Given Japan's rapidly ageing demographic structure, comprehensive and long-term evaluations of its national and subnational health progress are important to inform public health policy. This study aims to assess Japan's population health, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to analyse the country's evolving disease patterns.
METHODS: GBD 2021 used Japanese data from 1474 sources, covering 371 diseases, including COVID-19, and 88 risk factors. The analysis included estimates of life expectancy, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates were generated using the standardised GBD methodology, which incorporates various data sources through statistical modelling, including the Cause Of Death Ensemble Model for mortality, Bayesian Meta-Regression Disease Model for non-fatal outcomes, and risk factor estimation frameworks to quantify attributable burdens. Life expectancy decomposition by cause of death and annualised rates of change of age-standardised mortality and DALYs were calculated for 1990-2005, 2005-15, and 2015-21.
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2021, life expectancy in Japan rose from 79·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 79·3-79·4) to 85·2 years (85·1-85·2), with prefecture-level disparities widening. Gains were primarily driven by reduced mortality from stroke (adding 1·5 years to life expectancy), ischaemic heart disease (1·0 years), and neoplasms, particularly stomach cancer (0·5 years), with variation across prefectures. Leading causes of death in 2021 were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (135·3 deaths [39·5-312·3] per 100 000 population), stroke (114·9 [89·8-129·3] per 100 000), ischaemic heart disease (96·5 [77·7-106·7] per 100 000), and lung cancer (72·1 [61·8-77·5] per 100 000). Age-standardised mortality for major non-communicable diseases declined, but the pace of this decline has slowed. All-cause annualised rate of change in mortality rate decreased from -1·6% for 2005-15 to -1·1% for 2015-21. Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates were 0·8 deaths (0·7-0·9) per 100 000 population (accounting for 0·3% of all deaths) in 2020 and 3·0 (2·5-3·7) per 100 000 population in 2021 (1·0% of deaths). Age-standardised DALY rates for diabetes worsened, with annualised rate of change increasing from 0·1% for 2005-15 to 2·2% for 2015-21. This change parallels worsening trends in major risk factors, particularly high fasting plasma glucose (annualised rate of change of attributable DALYs -0·8% for 2005-15 and 0·8% for 2015-21) and high BMI (0·2% and 1·4%, respectively). Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower.
INTERPRETATION: Japan's health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

40054769,The Value of Positron Emission Tomography for Confirmation of Alzheimer's Disease in the Era of Amyloid-Targeting Therapies.,"OBJECTIVES: Amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as lecanemab, target and reduce brain β-amyloid plaques. To initiate therapy accurately, confirming the presence of brain β-amyloid plaques is necessary. This research investigated the added value and cost-effectiveness of <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET) in the United States.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to evaluate the differential diagnostic accuracy for AD and associated clinical and economic outcomes between <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. The model simulates the impact of the diagnostic modality choice in a hypothetical patient cohort with mild cognitive impairment or suspected AD and aged 40 to 79 years for eligibility to receive Amyloid-targeting therapy.
RESULTS: The use of <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol PET to diagnose AD results in an additional 14% of patients correctly identified versus CSF testing. Furthermore, the use of <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol PET leads to fewer patients expected to progress to moderate/severe AD (6.83% vs 6.91%) and is associated with decreased mortality (36.88% vs 37.06%). Over a patient's lifetime, <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol PET contributes an additional 0.02 discounted quality-adjusted life years compared with CSF (4.91 vs 4.89) with an incremental discounted cost of $1405. This translates to a cost of $73 872 per quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CSF testing, <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol PET imaging is less invasive, leading to more patients being correctly diagnosed and targeted for appropriate therapy, which has a downstream impact on disease progression and mortality. The model suggests that <sup>18</sup>F-flutemetamol PET is a cost-effective diagnostic modality for US payers.",Value Health
40148951,Teucrium Polium ameliorates amyloid β-induced brain network disorders in rats: electrophysiological and behavioral studies.,"Synaptic failure in specific cholinergic networks in rat brains has been implicated in amyloid β-induced neurodegeneration. Teucrium polium is a promising candidate for drug development against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and similar disorders. However, the protective effect of Teucrium polium against amyloid β-induced impairment of short-term synaptic plasticity is still poorly understood. In this study, we used in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings to investigate the preventive efficacy of Teucrium polium on Aβ(25-35)-induced aberrant neuronal activity in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala of rats, in response to high-frequency stimulation of the cholinergic nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). After 12 weeks of intracerebroventricular administration of Aβ(25-35), alterations such as decreased excitatory responses and increased inhibitory synaptic activity were observed in the NBM-hippocampus and NBM-basolateral amygdala cholinergic circuits. Treatment with Teucrium polium improved the balance of excitatory and inhibitory responses by modulating synaptic transmission strength and restoring short-term plasticity. Acute injection of a therapeutic dose of Teucrium temporarily inhibited spiking activity in single NBM neurons. Open field tests revealed that amyloid-injected rats displayed anxiety and reduced exploratory drive. Treatment with Teucrium polium improved these behaviors, reducing anxiety and increasing exploration. Teucrium polium mitigated amyloid β-induced alterations in cholinergic circuits by enhancing the adaptive capacity of short-term synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that Teucrium polium could serve as a preventive strategy to delay the progression of cholinergic neurodegeneration.",BMC Complement Med Ther
40126760,Distinct cerebral perfusion patterns and linguistic profiles in Alzheimer's disease-related primary progressive aphasia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related primary progressive aphasia (PPA) exhibits considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation and neuroimaging patterns. No studies have quantitatively assessed cerebral perfusion patterns or systematically evaluated the internal heterogeneity of linguistic and neuroimaging features in this population. This study aimed to investigate cerebral hypoperfusion patterns and elucidate their correlation with diverse linguistic features in patients with AD-related PPA using a data-driven approach. Eleven patients with AD-related PPA and 34 with non-AD-related PPA were categorized based on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and their single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data were analyzed. Cerebral hypoperfusion was assessed across 56 regions of interest (ROIs) covering the entire cerebral hemisphere. Sparse principal component (sPC) analysis was performed on the AD-related PPA group to identify distinct patterns of cerebral perfusion reduction and correlate these components with clinical assessments of linguistic abilities. AD-derived sPCs were identified, reflecting hypoperfusion patterns in the left temporoparietal, frontal, and temporal pole regions, corresponding to regions typically associated with logopenic, nonfluent, and semantic variants. In both AD-PPA and non-AD-PPA, the sPC corresponding to the anterior temporal region was associated with semantic comprehension deficits, whereas that corresponding to the frontal region was linked to nonfluent speech and Kana writing impairment. sPC-based hierarchical clustering revealed clusters corresponding to logopenic, nonfluent, and semantic variants, with the anomic subtype distinguished from logopenic PPA. AD-positive cases were distributed across these clusters, emphasizing AD-PPA heterogeneity. These findings suggested that AD-related PPA heterogeneity is reflected in distinct cerebral perfusion patterns, which correlate with varying linguistic deficits.",Neurol Sci

By examining published literature that reports on or utilizes Nun Study data, we provide an overview of its methodology and key findings, emphasizing its significant contributions to understanding cognitive impairment and related neuropathologies. Seminal findings on early-life factors affecting cognitive health, clinicopathological correlations, and apparent resistance and resilience to neuropathology are discussed. Decades of Nun Study research have made critical contributions to our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and highlight continuing objectives for future research.

40098057,Alpha synuclein co-pathology is associated with accelerated amyloid-driven tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Aggregated alpha-Synuclein (αSyn) is a hallmark pathology in Parkinson's disease but also one of the most common co-pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical studies suggest that αSyn can exacerbate tau aggregation, implying that αSyn co-pathology may specifically contribute to the Aβ-induced aggregation of tau that drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. To investigate this, we combined a novel CSF-based seed-amplification assay (SAA) to determine αSyn positivity with amyloid- and tau-PET neuroimaging in a large cohort ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with dementia, examining whether αSyn co-pathology accelerates Aβ-driven tau accumulation and cognitive decline.
METHODS: In 284 Aβ-positive and 308 Aβ-negative subjects, we employed amyloid-PET, Flortaucipir tau-PET, and a CSF-based αSyn seed-amplification assay (SAA) to detect in vivo αSyn aggregation. CSF p-tau<sub>181</sub> measures were available for 384 subjects to assess earliest tau abnormalities. A subset of 155 Aβ-positive and 135 Aβ-negative subjects underwent longitudinal tau-PET over approximately 2.5 years. Using linear regression models, we analyzed whether αSyn SAA positivity was linked to stronger Aβ-related increases in baseline fluid and PET tau biomarkers, faster Aβ-driven tau-PET increase, and more rapid cognitive decline.
RESULTS: αSyn SAA positivity was more common in Aβ + vs. Aβ- subjects and increased with clinical severity (p &lt; 0.001). Most importantly, αSyn positivity was also associated with greater amyloid-associated CSF p-tau<sub>181</sub> increases (p = 0.005) and higher tau-PET levels in AD-typical brain regions (p = 0.006). Longitudinal analyses confirmed further that αSyn positivity was associated with faster amyloid-related tau accumulation (p = 0.029) and accelerated amyloid-related cognitive decline, potentially driven driven by stronger tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that αSyn co-pathology, detectable via CSF-based SAAs, is more prevalent in advanced AD and contributes to the development of aggregated tau pathology thereby driving faster cognitive decline. This highlights that a-Syn co-pathology may specifically accelerate amyloid-driven tau pathophysiology in AD, underscoring the need to consider αSyn in AD research and treatment strategies.",Mol Neurodegener

40015754,Protocol for an intergenerational randomized controlled trial to enhance physical activity in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in North America. Despite this, most older adults are physically inactive. It is currently unknown how to successfully motivate physical activity behavior in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease, and this knowledge is crucial for early and effective disease prevention. Prior research has shown that intergenerational social engagement and prosocial behaviours can enhance the health and well-being of older adults.
OBJECTIVES: This manuscript describes the design of a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to enhance physical activity in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
DESIGN/SETTING: This is a single-blinded, two-arm stratified randomized controlled trial that incorporates a hybrid efficacy and implementation design. Participants are randomized to an intervention or control condition in a 1:1 ratio and are stratified by a multimodal Alzheimer's disease risk score. All study visits are conducted remotely through videoconferencing.
PARTICIPANTS: The study aims to recruit 60 older adults with a first-degree family history of Alzheimer's disease from the PREVENT-AD cohort and 30 younger adults who are paired with older adults in the intervention condition.
INTERVENTION: Older participants in the intervention group will be paired with younger study partners and receive positive, daily messages over four weeks using a novel technology platform. The daily messages combine intergenerational social engagement (growing a virtual garden with a younger study partner) and prosocial goals (donations to charity after reaching step count goals).
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is change in step count compared to baseline measured using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include time spent physically active, mood, generativity, loneliness, and cognition. Target mechanisms (social support and generativity) of physical activity engagement will be examined. Ease of use, acceptability, and feasibility of the technology as well as barriers and facilitators of participation will be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: This research will advance our understanding of mechanisms and individual differences underlying successful physical activity engagement in older adults who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge will contribute to strategies for promoting health behaviours that can prevent the risk of Alzheimer's disease.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40022196,Locus coeruleus tau validates and informs high-resolution MRI in aging and at earliest Alzheimer's pathology stages.,"The locus coeruleus (LC) has been identified as a site that develops phosphorylated tau pathology earlier than cerebral cortex. We present data using high-resolution postmortem MRI and validated tau histopathology in controls and the earliest Braak and Braak (BB) stages (BBI-BBII) in LC. The high-resolution ex vivo MRI provides a 3D volume (quantitative), while the histology reveals tau specificity and severity burden (semi-quantitative). We mapped our highly regionally specific LC data onto high-resolution 3D MRI reconstructions of the same samples used in histology (n = 11). We noted significant structural subatrophy between BB 0 and II (30.0% smaller volumes, p = 0.0381), a trend which primarily affected the rostral-most LC (49.2% smaller average volume, p = 0.0381). We show histopathology data on both the LC and neighboring dorsal raphe caudal (DRc), which were assessed at multiple rostrocaudal levels and mapped with highly sensitive tau severity spatial matrices. We observed significant LC tau accumulation between BB I and II (37.6% increase, p < 0.0001), which may reflect pathology change prior to presumptive cognitive impairment at BB III. Tau pathology was most severe in the middle portion of the LC (11.3% greater compared to rostral LC, p = 0.0289) when including BB III. We noted a significant rostrocaudal gradient of DRc tau severity (58.2% decrease between rostral and caudal DRc, p < 0.0001), suggesting selective regional vulnerabilities of both nuclei. Our study represents a rigorous approach to investigating LC and DRc pathology, having multiple histology sections per sublevel and high-resolution MRI to measure the whole LC, without missing slices in a histological only approach. Taken together, our findings provide novel validated data that demonstrate the tau pathology occurring in the LC and DRc during preclinical AD stages, and alongside spatial reconstructions that will serve as valuable references for in vivo LC imaging.",Acta Neuropathol Commun
40157803,Neuroprotective mechanisms of exercise and the importance of fitness for healthy brain ageing.,"Ageing is a scientifically fascinating and complex biological occurrence characterised by morphological and functional changes due to accumulated molecular and cellular damage impairing tissue and organ function. Ageing is often accompanied by cognitive decline but is also the biggest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. Emerging evidence suggests that sedentary and unhealthy lifestyles accelerate brain ageing, while regular physical activity, high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), or a combination of both, can mitigate cognitive impairment and reduce dementia risk. The purpose of this Review is to explore the neuroprotective mechanisms of endurance exercise and highlight the importance of CRF in promoting healthy brain ageing. Key findings show how CRF mediates the neuroprotective effects of exercise via mechanisms such as improved cerebral blood flow, reduced inflammation, and enhanced neuroplasticity. We summarise evidence supporting the integration of endurance exercise that enhances CRF into public health initiatives as a preventive measure against age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, we address important challenges such as lack of long-term studies with harmonised study designs across preclinical and clinical settings, employing carefully controlled and repeatable exercise protocols, and outline directions for future research.",Lancet

40111925,"Predictors of transitions between normal cognition, cognitive impairment, and dementia in a longitudinal cohort.","BackgroundUnderstanding how sociodemographic characteristics and medical history are associated with progression (or regression) of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias could inform intervention strategies, personalized prognoses, and projections of population-level burden.ObjectiveWe estimated transition rates for progression and reversion between normal cognition, cognitive impairment, dementia, and death in a longitudinal cohort, as well as associations with sociodemographic characteristics and medical history.MethodsWe applied a multistate transition model to a cohort of 960 participants (with 2-16 (median 3) annual visits; 2006-24). Covariate hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated in models adjusted for age group.ResultsSeveral covariates were associated with faster progression from normal cognition to cognitive impairment but slower progression from cognitive impairment to dementia. For example, non-Hispanic Black participants transitioned from normal to cognitive impairment at higher rates (HR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.63, 3.21) and to dementia at lower rates (HR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.23) than non-Hispanic White participants. Additionally, amnestic versus non-amnestic impairment emerged as a strong predictor of transitions from cognitive impairment by reducing reversion to normal cognition (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74) and accelerating progression to dementia (HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.49, 4.22). History of traumatic brain injury was associated with reversion from cognitive impairment to normal cognition (HR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.13, 5.23).ConclusionsA better understanding and measurement of cognitive impairment is needed to explain and predict both reversion to normal cognition and why factors associated with faster onset of impairment may be associated with delayed onset of dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis
40055039,Healthy dietary patterns in relation to cognitive performance and Alzheimer's disease mortality.,"BACKGROUND: Dietary factors play a major role in cognitive aging, but few studies have assessed and compared the associations between specific dietary patterns and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mortality.
METHODS: We included 27,773 U.S. participants (mean age = 59.8 years, 51.4 % female) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1998 and 2016, with follow-up for AD mortality until December 2019. Five dietary pattern scores were calculated utilizing one (1999-2002) or two repeated (2003-2016) 24hr dietary recalls, including the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015), the healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED), the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), and the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegeneration Delay diet (MIND) scores. We utilized Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the associations of these dietary pattern scores with AD mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 260 AD deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 9.8 years. Higher aMED score was associated with a lower risk of AD mortality (HR<sub>T3</sub><sub>vs T1</sub>: 0.72, 95 % CI, 0.52-1.00, p-trend = 0.041). In a sub-sample of 2,713 participants in NHANES 2011-2014, 432 individuals had prevalent psychometric mild cognitive impairment (p-MCI). Higher aMED, MIND, HEI-2015, and hPDI were associated with lower odds of p-MCI. The potential contributors to these associations included higher intake levels of vegetables and nuts, moderate alcohol consumption, and lower intake level of sweets.
CONCLUSIONS: The Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with more favorable cognitive outcomes among middle-aged and older adults, underscoring the importance of a healthy diet for long-term benefits in cognitive and brain health.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40052092,The role of Apolipoprotein E4 on cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonisms.,"Cognitive impairment is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing the risk of dementia as the disease progresses. Despite its clinical significance, the etiology of cognitive impairment in PD remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a well-known genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's disease, has been studied for its potential role in PD-related cognitive impairment. However, findings have been conflicting and thus inconclusive, highlighting a need to critically evaluate the current research. Several studies using neuroimaging modalities have explored the brains of individuals with PD and atypical parkinsonian disorders who have APOE4. Some of these studies have identified distinct neuropathological changes that have been previously reported to be associated with cognitive impairments in those with Parkinsonisms. Here, we review the role of APOE4 on cognitive impairment in PD and atypical Parkinsonisms using neuroimaging evidence. We will examine how APOE4 may contribute to pathological changes within the brain and its association with cognitive impairment.",Front Neurosci
40071121,Imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the correlation between cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) imaging markers and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: In July 2024, two researchers independently conducted a thorough literature search across databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The selected studies investigated the correlations between white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), lacunar infarction (LI), and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and the risk of AD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was employed to assess the risk of bias in the included cohort and case-control studies.
RESULTS: A total of 6,487 articles were identified, with 15 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses showed that WMHs (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.10-1.74, N = 7,661), CMBs (HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07-2.40, N = 6,567), and EPVS (HR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.24-2.72, N = 3,045) were associated with an increased risk of AD, with EPVS showing the strongest correlation. LI did not show a statistically significant association with an increased risk of AD (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.98-2.01, N = 4,014).
CONCLUSION: WMHs, CMBs, and EPVS are associated with an elevated risk of AD, whereas LI is considered a potential risk factor. However, additional studies are required to determine the role of CSVD markers in AD progression.",Front Aging Neurosci
40163031,Unsupervised Deep Learning of Electronic Health Records to Characterize Heterogeneity Across Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Cross-Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) exhibit prominent heterogeneity. Identifying clinically meaningful ADRD subtypes is essential for tailoring treatments to specific patient phenotypes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use unsupervised learning techniques on electronic health records (EHRs) from memory clinic patients to identify ADRD subtypes.
METHODS: We used pretrained embeddings of non-ADRD diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) and large language model (LLM)-derived embeddings of clinical notes from patient EHRs. Hierarchical clustering of these embeddings was used to identify ADRD subtypes. Clusters were characterized regarding their demographic and clinical features.
RESULTS: We analyzed a cohort of 3454 patients with ADRD from a memory clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital, each with a specialist diagnosis. Clustering pretrained embeddings of the non-ADRD diagnosis codes in patient EHRs revealed the following 3 patient subtypes: one with skin conditions, another with psychiatric disorders and an earlier age of onset, and a third with diabetes complications. Similarly, using LLM-derived embeddings of clinical notes, we identified 3 subtypes of patients as follows: one with psychiatric manifestations and higher prevalence of female participants (prevalence ratio: 1.59), another with cardiovascular and motor problems and higher prevalence of male participants (prevalence ratio: 1.75), and a third one with geriatric health disorders. Notably, we observed significant overlap between clusters from both data modalities (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>4</sub>=89.4; P&lt;.001).
CONCLUSIONS: By integrating International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and LLM-derived embeddings, our analysis delineated 2 distinct ADRD subtypes with sex-specific comorbid and clinical presentations, offering insights for potential precision medicine approaches.",JMIR Aging
40038194,Deciphering the Neuroprotective Action of Bee Venom Peptide Melittin: Insights into Mechanistic Interplay.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal structure and function. These conditions often lead to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and ultimately severe impairment of daily activities. A key feature of neurodegenerative diseases is chronic inflammation, which contributes to neuronal damage and exacerbates disease progression. Traditional treatments mainly focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying causes, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Melittin, a bioactive peptide derived from bee venom, has garnered attention for its multifaceted neuroprotective properties, particularly in the context of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms through which melittin exerts neuroprotective effects, with a focus on its ability to modulate neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. Research indicates that melittin can downregulate pro-apoptotic pathways by inhibiting calpain-mediated activation of apoptosis-inducing factor and Bax, thereby reducing neuronal cell death. Additionally, melittin exerts its neuroprotective effects through the inhibition of neuroinflammatory processes, specifically by downregulating key inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. This modulation leads to decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Beyond its anti-inflammatory actions, melittin promotes neurogenesis, potentially through the modulation of the BDNF/Trk-B/CREB signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in neuronal survival and plasticity. These properties suggest that melittin not only provides symptomatic relief but could also address the root causes of neuronal degeneration, presenting a promising avenue for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is required to validate its efficacy and safety in clinical settings.",Mol Neurobiol
40145360,Social cognition in mild cognitive impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Social cognition is impaired in people with dementia but the differences in social cognitive impairment between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and its subtypes remain unclear. We therefore aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze differences in emotion recognition, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy between individuals with MCI and dementia. Across 28 cross-sectional studies (n = 2409), people with MCI had better emotion recognition (Cohen's d = 0.69) and ToM (d = 0.70) than individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and larger effect sizes were observed for people with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (emotion recognition (d = 2.09), ToM (d = 1.49), but emotional empathy was higher in AD than in MCI in included studies. Our findings suggest a progressive decline of aspects of social cognition across the MCI-dementia continuum. Longitudinal studies should investigate the diagnostic role of social cognition deficits in MCI progression to dementia, and interventions for social cognition in MCI should be developed and tested. HIGHLIGHTS: First systematic review and meta-analysis comparing social cognition between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia subtypes. Findings from 28 studies with 2409 participants show people with MCI outperform those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in emotion recognition and theory of mind. Empathy appears intact in AD dementia, suggesting that this cognitive domain is preserved throughout disease progression. Evaluation of social cognition should be built into dementia assessment as it may hold diagnostic value.",Alzheimers Dement
40116686,"Reduced GABA<sub>A, slow</sub> synaptic inhibition in Alzheimer's disease.","Altered synaptic physiology clearly contributes to memory loss and other CNS symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. A new paper in this issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, from Zhe Jin's group in Uppsala, Sweden, adds important new information to help us understand how. A powerful, yet largely uncharacterized form of neuronal inhibition-GABA<sub>A, slow</sub> synaptic current-was studied using whole-cell recordings in hippocampal brain slices from AD model mice (tg-APPSwe). The investigators found that GABA<sub>A, slow</sub> inhibition was significantly reduced in dentate granule neurons from aged AD mice, compared to both wild type and adult non-aged AD mice. This reduction would nicely explain the change in excitatory-inhibitory balance previously reported in this and other AD model animals, as well as impairments in pattern separation and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling that are early manifestations of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40110679,Metabolic stress and age drive inflammation and cognitive decline in mice and humans.,"INTRODUCTION: Metabolic stressors (obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes [T2D]) increase the risk of cognitive impairment (CI), including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immune system dysregulation and inflammation, particularly microglial mediated, may underlie this risk, but mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: Using a high-fat diet-fed (HFD) model, we assessed longitudinal metabolism and cognition, and terminal inflammation and brain spatial transcriptomics. Additionally, we performed hippocampal spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing of post mortem tissue from AD and T2D human subjects versus controls.
RESULTS: HFD induced progressive metabolic and CI with terminal inflammatory changes, and dysmetabolic, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory gene expression profiles, particularly in microglia. AD and T2D human subjects had similar gene expression changes, including in secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), a pro-inflammatory gene associated with AD.
DISCUSSION: These data show that metabolic stressors cause early and progressive CI, with inflammatory changes that promote disease. They also indicate a role for microglia, particularly microglial SPP1, in CI.
HIGHLIGHTS: Metabolic stress causes persistent metabolic and cognitive impairments in mice. Murine and human brain spatial transcriptomics align and indicate a pro-inflammatory milieu. Transcriptomic data indicate a role for microglial-mediated inflammatory mechanisms. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 emerged as a potential target of interest in metabolically driven cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement
40138382,Naturido alleviates amyloid β1-42-induced adverse effects in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily associated with aging. While the amyloid hypothesis is not the only explanation for AD pathogenesis, it is widely recognized that the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) protein triggers pathological changes in the brains of patients. In a previous study, we showed that Naturido, a cyclic peptide derived from the medicinal fungus (Isaria japonica) grown on domestic silkworms (Bombyx mori), could reverse several age-related deficits in senescence-accelerated mice. In this study, we explored the potential of Naturido to reduce Aβ-related toxicity in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of AD, where human Aβ1-42 protein is overexpressed in neurons. Our results demonstrated that Naturido administration alleviated various phenotypes, including Aβ-induced impairment in associative learning, serotonin hypersensitivity, and locomotion in the transgenic C. elegans. These findings suggest the potential of Naturido as a candidate molecule for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.",PLoS One
40033427,Synaptic protein CSF levels relate to memory scores in individuals without dementia.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated how cerebrospinal fluid levels of synaptic proteins associate with memory function in normal cognition (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and investigated the effect of amyloid positivity on these associations.
METHODS: We included 242 CN (105(43%) abnormal amyloid), and 278 MCI individuals (183(66%) abnormal amyloid) from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For 181 (EMIF-AD MBD) and 36 (ADNI) proteins with a synaptic annotation in SynGO, associations with word learning recall were analysed with linear models.
RESULTS: Subsets of synaptic proteins showed lower levels with worse recall in preclinical AD (EMIF-AD MBD: 7, ADNI: 5 proteins, none overlapping), prodromal AD (EMIF-AD MBD only, 27 proteins) and non-AD MCI (EMIF-AD MBD: 1, ADNI: 7 proteins). The majority of these associations were specific to these clinical groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Synaptic disturbance-related memory impairment occurred very early in AD, indicating it may be relevant to develop therapies targeting the synapse early in the disease.",Alzheimers Res Ther

40043316,Genetic association study between rs2234253 (p.T96K) variant of TREM2 and Alzheimer's disease in a Tunisian population.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of major neurodegenerative cognitive impairment. The risk of developing AD is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Among the genetic risk factors, the APOE ɛ4 allele is the most significant, while variants in the TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2) and ABCA7 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A7) genes have also been associated with an increased risk of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association of APOE ɛ4, TREM2 gene variants (rs75932628 [p.R47H] and rs2234253 [p.T96K]), and ABCA7 gene variants (rs142076058 and rs115550680) with sporadic AD in the Tunisian population. Methods: A case-control study was conducted including 222 Tunisian patients diagnosed with sporadic AD and 99 cognitively healthy controls. Genotyping was performed to assess the presence and association of the selected genetic variants with AD. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the significance of genetic associations.
RESULTS: A significant association was found between the TREM2 rs2234253 (p.T96K) variant and AD, with the T allele identified as a risk factor in the Tunisian population. The APOE ɛ4 allele was also associated with an increased risk of developing AD. However, no significant association was observed for the ABCA7 gene variants or the TREM2 rs75932628 (p.R47H) variant in either the AD or control groups.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the TREM2 rs2234253 (p.T96K) variant is a significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (LOAD) in the Tunisian population. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these findings and explore potential gene-gene interactions contributing to AD risk.",Neurol Res
40007341,Lycium barbarum extract improves brain and visual functions in mice models of Alzheimer's disease through activating WNT pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, characterized by visual deficits and cognitive impairment. However, current therapies have limited efficacy.
PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate whether Lycium barbarum extract (LBE) can mitigate the decline in brain and visual function in mouse models of AD during the middle and late stages.
METHODS: The chemical constituents of LBE were identified using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. LBE was administered daily to 5xFAD mice for one month and to 3xTG mice for two months, via the intragastric route, until the middle and late stages of AD. Visual and brain functions were assessed through behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. The structure of the hippocampal region and retina was evaluated using immunostaining. RNA sequencing and western blotting were performed to explore potential mechanisms.
RESULTS: Sixteen compounds were identified in LBE, with lycibarbarspermidines and rutin being the major components. Functionally, LBE significantly improved memory and light responses of retinal ganglion cells in both 5xFAD and 3xTG mice. It also enhanced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and cortical visual function in 3xTG mice. Structurally, LBE reduced hippocampal Aβ deposits in 5xFAD mice and Tau phosphorylation in 3xTG mice. In the retinas of 3xTG mice, LBE increased ganglion cell survival and inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, LBE restored the expression of WNT5a/b and KRAS, and inhibited GSK3β activation in the retinas of 3xTG mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that LBE can alleviate visual and brain function deterioration in various AD mouse models, even at the middle or late stages, possibly through the activation of the WNT pathway leading to the inhibition of Tau phosphorylation. This study reveals a novel mechanism of LBE action and proposes a promising strategy for treating AD patients using natural plant extracts, even at advanced stages.",Phytomedicine
40068028,Hippocampal volume asymmetry in Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers play an important role in the diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD), with the hippocampal emerging as the most reliable indicator of AD pathology. Elucidation of the patient's left and right hippocampal volumes warrants further consideration. Therefore, caution should be exercised regarding the constraints inherent in the measurement method. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the left and right hippocampal volume changes and the volume measurement method.
METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched and published until September 2023. A total of 29 studies were included in this meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis results indicate a significant reduction in total hippocampal volume in AD patients. The results for the hippocampal volume on the left and right sides of 3 classes, such as AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC), showed a greater reduction on the left side. The results showed in AD: 95% confidence interval (CI) = -142 to 1.61, P = .04, I2 = 44%; MCI: 95% CI= -186 to -72, P = <.00001, I2 = 0%, and NC: 95% CI = -141 to 14, P = .11, I2 = 80%, respectively, with random effect. The left hippocampal in AD is smaller, while the right hippocampal is larger. The AD class significantly reduced hippocampal volume on both the left and right sides.

40013096,Exploring cognitive and neuroimaging profiles of dementia subtypes of individuals with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"OBJECTIVE: The 2024 Alzheimer's Association (AA) research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) considers fluid biomarkers, including promising blood-based biomarkers for detecting AD. This study aims to identify dementia subtypes and their cognitive and neuroimaging profiles in older adults with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using biomarkers and clinical data.
METHODS: Forty-five individuals with dementia over 65 years old were evaluated using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and the informant-based Alzheimer's Questionnaire. Core AD biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and p-tau181) and non-specific neurodegeneration biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) were measured in blood plasma. Neuroimaging structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia subtypes were determined based on plasma biomarker pathology and vascular markers. Biomarker cutoff scores were identified to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Individuals were stratified into one of four dementia subtypes-AD only, non-AD vascular, non-AD other, or mixed - based on combinations of abnormalities in these markers.
RESULTS: Among the 45 individuals with dementia, mixed dementia had the highest prevalence (42.4%), followed by AD-only (24.4%), non-AD other dementia (22.2%), and non-AD vascular dementia subtypes (11.1%). Both cognitive and neuroimaging profiles aligned poorly with biomarker classifications in the full sample. Cognitive tests varied across dementia subtypes. The cognitive profile of the AD-only and mixed groups suggested relatively low cognitive performance, while the non-AD and other groups had the best scores on average.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with studies in other settings, our preliminary findings suggest that neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers may help to identify dementia subtypes and provide insight into cognitive and neuroimaging profiles among older adults in the DRC.",Front Aging Neurosci
40039256,Profiling Patient Transcript Using Large Language Model Reasoning Augmentation for Alzheimer's Disease Detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant cause of dementia, characterized by a gradual decline in speech and language capabilities. Recent deeplearning advancements have facilitated automated AD detection through spontaneous speech. However, common transcript-based detection methods directly model text patterns in each utterance without a global view of the patient's linguistic characteristics, resulting in limited discriminability and interpretability. Despite the enhanced reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there remains a gap in fully harnessing the reasoning ability to facilitate AD detection and model interpretation. Therefore, we propose a patient-level transcript profiling framework leveraging LLM-based reasoning augmentation to systematically elicit linguistic deficit attributes. The summarized embeddings of the attributes are integrated into an Albert model for AD detection. The framework achieves 8.51% ACC and 8.34% F1 improvements on the ADReSS dataset compared to the baseline without reasoning augmentation. Our further analysis shows the effectiveness of our identified linguistic deficit attributes and the potential to use LLM for AD detection interpretation.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc

The dysregulation of these enzymes has been implicated in a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, and neurological problems like epilepsy. A hallmark of these disorders is the gradual loss of neuronal integrity and function, often exacerbated by protein accumulation within brain cells. This review delves into the multifaceted role of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase dysfunction in driving oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation, contributing to synaptic and neuronal damage. Emerging therapeutic strategies, such as gene therapy and developing isoform-specific enzyme modulators, offer promising avenues for targeted interventions. Furthermore, this review highlights innovative research directions, including the role of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase in synaptic plasticity, the identification of endogenous regulators, and its contribution to neuroinflammatory pathways.

This study explores the cell-type-specific expression of Nav1.6 in C57BL/6 mice brains at various developmental stages. Coronal sections from embryonic day 14 to postnatal day 30 were examined. Nav1.6 expression increased at both protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels during this period. Immunofluorescence double staining revealed that Nav1.6 is primarily localized on neurons. Astrocytes show increasing expression from prenatal to postnatal stages, correlating with maturation. Microglia exhibit low-intensity expression throughout the development. Co-expression of Nav1.6 with oligodendrocyte precursor cell marker NG2 is observed from E14 through postnatal stages, with prominent co-expression on day 21 and day 30. Consistent co-expression with olig2 is observed from E16 to day 30. In primary cultures, astrocytes had higher Nav1.6 levels compared to microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Nav1.6 expression was upregulated in astrocytes and microglia in APP/amyloid beta precursor protein/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice. Down-regulating Nav1.6 in vitro reduced amyloid beta-induced microglial activation and cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α). These findings highlight Nav1.6 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions against neurodegenerative diseases.",Cereb Cortex

The integration and interpretation of multi-omic data are critical for identifying disease targets and deciphering disease signaling pathways. However, it remains an open problem due to the complex signaling interactions among many proteins. Herein, we propose a multi-scale multi-hop multi-omic network flow model, M3NetFlow, to facilitate both hypothesis-guided and generic multi-omic data analysis tasks. We evaluated M3NetFlow using two independent case studies: (1) uncovering mechanisms of synergy of drug combinations (hypothesis/anchor-target guided multi-omic analysis) and (2) identifying biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (generic multi-omic analysis). The evaluation and comparison results showed that M3NetFlow achieved the best prediction accuracy and identified a set of drug combination synergy- and disease-associated targets.

40117001,"Machine-learning models for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using neuroimaging data: survey, reproducibility, and generalizability evaluation.","Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually made after symptoms such as short-term memory loss are exhibited, which minimizes the intervention and treatment options. The existing screening techniques cannot distinguish between stable MCI (sMCI) cases (i.e., patients who do not convert to AD for at least three years) and progressive MCI (pMCI) cases (i.e., patients who convert to AD in three years or sooner). Delayed diagnosis of AD also disproportionately affects underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The significant positive impact of an early diagnosis solution for AD across diverse ethno-racial and demographic groups is well-known and recognized. While advancements in high-throughput technologies have enabled the generation of vast amounts of multimodal clinical, and neuroimaging datasets related to AD, most methods utilizing these data sets for diagnostic purposes have not found their way in clinical settings. To better understand the landscape, we surveyed the major preprocessing, data management, traditional machine-learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques used for diagnosing AD using neuroimaging data such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Once we had a good understanding of the methods available, we conducted a study to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of open-source ML models. Our evaluation shows that existing models show reduced generalizability when different cohorts of the data modality are used while controlling other computational factors. The paper concludes with a discussion of major challenges that plague ML models for AD diagnosis and biomarker discovery.",Brain Inform

40025710,Frailty in motion: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease cohorts display heterogeneity in multimorbidity classification and longitudinal transitions.,"BACKGROUND: Data-driven examination of multiple morbidities and deficits are informative for clinical and research applications in aging and dementia. Resulting profiles may change longitudinally according to dynamic alterations in extent, duration, and pattern of risk accumulation. Do such frailty-related changes include not only progression but also stability and reversion?
OBJECTIVE: With cognitively impaired and dementia cohorts, we employed data-driven analytics to (a) detect the extent of heterogeneity in frailty-related multimorbidity and deficit burden subgroups and (b) identify key person characteristics predicting differential transition patterns.
METHODS: We assembled baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts. We applied factor analyses to 43 multimorbidity and deficit indicators. Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) was applied to the resulting domains in order to detect subgroups differing in transition patterns for multimorbidity and deficit burden. We characterized heterogeneity in change patterns by evaluating key person characteristics as differential predictors.
RESULTS: Factor analyses revealed five domains at two time points. LTA showed that two latent burden subgroups at Time 1 (Low, Moderate) differentiated into an additional two subgroups at Time 2 (adding Mild, Severe). Transition analyses detected heterogeneous changes, including progression, stability, and reversion. Baseline classifications and transitions varied according to clinical cohort, global cognition, sex, age, and education.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous frailty-related subgroup transitions can be (a) detected in aging adults living with aMCI and AD, (b) characterized as not only progression but also stability and reversion, and (c) predicted by precision characteristics.",J Alzheimers Dis
40051287,"Novel 2-Alkoxy-3-Cyanopyridine Derivatives as Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and In Silico Investigations.","Alzheimer's disease remains a major challenge in neuroscience and medicine. Cholinesterase inhibitors provide symptomatic relief but do not alter disease progression. While significant progress has been made in understanding its biology, there is an urgent need for effective therapies. In this study, a series of 2-alkoxy-3-cyanopyridine derivatives (1-7) were prepared and evaluated as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Among the compounds, 3 and 4 were identified as good inhibitors of AChE and BuChE with relatively low IC<sub>50</sub> values. 3 inhibited AChE with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 53.95 ± 4.29 µM, while 4 had a greater potency for BuChE with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 31.79 ± 0.38 µM. Kinetic studies revealed that 3 and 4 are competitive inhibitors with K<sub>i</sub> values of 14.23 ± 0.42 and 19.80 ± 3.38 µM for AChE and BuChE, respectively. In silico investigations, including docking studies, DFT calculations, and ADME/drug-likeness properties, were carried out to understand the mode of interaction of 3 and 4 toward the AChE and BuChE enzymes, as well as to determine their molecular geometry, chemical reactivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. This study highlights the potential of 3-cyanopyridine derivatives in the treatment of AD and provides a solid foundation for further optimization and exploration of their therapeutic applications.",Chem Biodivers
39996369,"Presenilin, γ-Secretase, and the Search for Pathogenic Triggers of Alzheimer's Disease.","Cerebral plaques of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) are a defining pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis has dominated the field for over 30 years, ostensibly validated by rare AD-causing mutations in the substrate and enzyme that produce Aβ. The γ-secretase complex carries out intramembrane proteolysis of the substrate derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations in APP and presenilin, the catalytic component of γ-secretase, typically increase the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) over the more soluble 40-residue form (Aβ40). Nevertheless, the inability to clarify how Aβ aggregation leads to neurodegeneration, along with poor progress in developing effective AD therapeutics that target Aβ, raises concern about whether Aβ is the primary disease driver. γ-Secretase carries out processive proteolysis on the APP substrate, producing long Aβ peptides that are generally trimmed in tripeptide intervals to shorter secreted peptides. Recent studies on effects of AD-causing mutations on the complicated proteolytic processing of the APP substrate by γ-secretase has led to the discovery that these mutations reduce─but do not abolish─processive proteolysis. Reduced proteolysis is apparently due to stabilization of enzyme-substrate complexes, and these stalled substrate-bound γ-secretase complexes can trigger synaptic degeneration even in the absence of Aβ production. Thus, the stalled process rather than the proteolytic products may be a principal initiator of AD pathogenesis. This new amyloid-independent hypothesis suggests that pharmacological agents that rescue stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate complexes might be effective therapeutics for AD prevention and/or treatment.",Biochemistry
40009262,Evolving Insights into Prickle2 in Neurodevelopment and Neurological Disorders.,"The development of neural circuits is a complex, highly coordinated process crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. This process involves the intricate interplay of numerous genes and signaling pathways. Prickle2, a protein encoded by the planar cell polarity (PCP) genes, is a key component of the noncanonical Wnt/PCP signaling pathway and plays a critical role in neural circuit development. Recent studies have highlighted the essential functions of Prickle2 in various stages of neural circuit formation, including the development of the initial segment of neuronal axons, axon elongation and regeneration, dendrite formation, synapse formation, and vesicle transport. The normal expression and spatial distribution of Prickle2 are vital for these processes, and its dysregulation has been associated with several neurological disorders, including congenital neural tube defects, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. This review aims to systematically summarize the upstream and downstream signaling pathways and regulatory interactions involving Prickle2 in neurodevelopment and neural circuit formation. By discussing the expression patterns of Prickle2 in neurodevelopment and its associations with neurological diseases, we provide insights into the mechanisms through which Prickle2 influences neurodevelopment and its potential implications in neurological disorders.",Mol Neurobiol
40071061,Opportunities to encourage adoption of a biomarker-enabled care pathway for Alzheimer's in primary care.,"UNLABELLED: Identification of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a challenge due to limited specialist availability, diagnostic access, disease awareness, and cultural factors. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) could play a critical role in the identification and referral of patients suspected of AD to specialty care. A multidisciplinary AD Biomarker Task Force was convened to evaluate current biomarker use cases, define an optimal biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway, and understand factors impacting adoption. The Task Force identified opportunities to support biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway adoption, including streamlining risk assessment and screening by leveraging digital tools, activating primary care providers through education, generating data to expand applicability to diverse populations, and advocating for aligned policies and quality measures. Adoption of BBBMs in the primary care setting will be critical to improve early AD detection. However, challenges to pathway adoption persist and will require action from clinicians, payers, policy makers, and patients to address.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood-based biomarkers can streamline the identification of AD in primary care.Future biomarker-enabled diagnostic care pathways will leverage digital assessments.Education, data generation, and policy advocacy are vital to encourage BBBM use.Implementation of AD care pathways requires the activation of diverse stakeholders.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
39985478,Role of tau versus TDP-43 pathology on medial temporal lobe atrophy in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging is an important biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While hippocampal atrophy was thought to result from tau tangles in AD, different neuropathologies can lead to hippocampal atrophy, especially TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. In this narrative review, we evaluate existing studies on the relative contribution of tau and TDP-43 pathology to medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. We report a clear association of both tau and TDP-43 neuropathology with MTL atrophy, even after correcting for other neuropathologies. Next, we discuss a potential synergism between tau and TDP-43 and the relative timing of the effects of both neuropathologies. Finally, avenues for future research will be discussed. A better understanding of the interplay between tau and TDP-43 neuropathologies and their effect on atrophy will help with the development of more specific biomarkers for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and pinpointing of the optimal timing for testing anti-tau and anti-TDP-43 treatments in trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Both tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology contribute to medial temporal lobe atrophy. There is a positive association between tau and TDP-43 and potentially a synergism. It is unclear if tau and TDP-43 have an additive or synergistic effect on atrophy. The relative timing of the tau and TDP-43 effects on atrophy remains unclear. Clarifying the interplay between tau and TDP-43 will help improve magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers.",Alzheimers Dement
39996035,Amyloid is associated with accelerated atrophy in cognitively unimpaired individuals.,"INTRODUCTION: This study examined the association of longitudinal atrophy with baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ, A) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau, T) biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181) in 406 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals (6.670 years of follow-up on average, up to 13 imaging visits) to assess whether A+ is associated with Alzheimer's disease-like atrophy and whether this depends on p-tau181 levels.
METHODS: An A-T- CU group free from abnormal neurodegeneration (N) was identified using a robust normative approach and used to model normal age-related atrophy via z-scoring. Linear mixed-effects models tested differences in longitudinal atrophy between A+ and A-T-N- individuals and between A/T subgroups.
RESULTS: A+ was associated with worse atrophy within and beyond the medial temporal lobe, even at low levels of p-tau181.
DISCUSSION: Neurodegeneration likely begins soon after the onset of abnormal Aβ pathology. Clinical intervention at the earliest signs of Aβ pathology may be needed to mitigate further neurodegeneration.

40056144,Cytotoxicity of Amyloid β1-42 Fibrils to Brain Immune Cells.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive pathology that is linked to abrupt aggregation of amyloid β<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) peptide in the central nervous system. Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation yields amyloid oligomers and fibrils, toxic protein aggregates that cause progressive neuronal degeneration in the frontal lobe of the brain. Although neurons remain the focus of AD for decades, a growing body of evidence suggests that the degeneration of immune cells in the brain can be the major cause of AD. However, the extent to which Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregates are toxic to the major classes of immune cells in the brain remains unclear. In the current study, we examine the cytotoxic effects of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> fibrils on macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia. These cells play vitally important roles in development and homeostasis of the central nervous system. We found that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> fibrils caused calcium release and enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species in macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia as well as neurons. We also investigated the extent to which the lysozymes of these immune cells could alter the aggregation properties of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Our results showed that lysosomes extracted from macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia drastically accelerated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation as well as altered cytotoxicity of these protein aggregates. These results indicate that impairment of immune cells in the brain can be a critically important aspect of neurodegenerative processes that are taking place upon the onset of AD.",ACS Chem Neurosci
39986222,Tianqi Yizhi Granule alleviates cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration in SAMP8 mice via the PKC/ERK pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Given the lack of satisfactory clinical treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition detrimental to health, developing alternative therapies is critical. Tianqi Yizhi Granule (TQYZ) is a preparation used to treat AD based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, the latent mechanisms of which await elucidation.
PURPOSE: This study sought to investigate the neuroprotective properties of TQYZ while exploring its potential therapeutic mechanisms using network pharmacology analyses and experimental validation.
METHODS: Network pharmacology analyses were performed. Cognitive and neurodegenerative alterations were evaluated through behavioral tests and histological staining. For in vivo and in vitro experiments, short hairpin RNA sequences were transfected via adeno-associated virus vectors to verify the predicted mechanism.
RESULTS: A total of 159 potential therapeutic targets of TQYZ overlapped with AD-related targets. In senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, treatment with TQYZ significantly improved cognitive function, ameliorated neuronal damage and apoptosis, and upregulated the protein expression of PKC/ERK pathway members. TQYZ maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced HT22 cells. However, these neuroprotective effects were notably reduced in shRNA PRKCB-transfected HT22 cells and SAMP8 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: TQYZ mitigates the pathological degeneration process and cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice and suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in HT22 cells treated with Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>. Its neuroprotective mechanism is linked to PKC/ERK pathway activation. This study highlights a promising strategy for AD therapy.",Phytomedicine
39993744,"Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitor, FG4592, Induces Endogenous Metallothionein3 Expression in Human Neuronal Cell Line, ReNcell CX Cells.","Metallothionein (MT) is a small-molecule protein that functions in essential trace element homeostasis. Among MT isoforms, MT3 is involved in neuronal activity, and its expression is reported to be decreased in patients with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease; however, only a few effective drugs have been reported to induce MT3 expression. In this study, we evaluated existing drugs for the induction of MT3 expression in the neuronal cell line of ReNcell CX cells. Using recombinant proteins of MT isoforms with the 3× Flag tag, we performed Western blotting (WB) with the primary antibodies against MT3 or Flag tag, and this method of WB for MT3 was confirmed specifically to detect the MT3 protein. We treated ReNcell CX cells with several HIF-PH inhibitors and evaluated MT3 expression via real-time RT-PCR. We found that FG4592 significantly enhanced MT3 expression at both RNA and protein levels. FG4592 treatment increased the amount of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) binding to the MT3 promoter. These findings indicate that FG4592 induces MT3 expression via increased HIF1α. In conclusion, we found FG4592 to be an endogenous MT3 inducer in the cells of the nervous system in this study. The findings of this study are expected to lead to the development of new MT3-inducing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases based on FG4592.",Biol Pharm Bull
40166615,Strategic delivery of omega-3 fatty acids for modulating inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases.,"OBJECTIVES: Early-life inflammatory events like infections and injuries may predispose the brain to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by disrupting neurodevelopment and raising vulnerability. The association between early neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration leading to dementia remains unclear. We hypothesize that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FA), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), positively regulate neuro-immune cells, preserving their cell membrane structure and metabolic homeostasis. Our study examined whether strategic delivery of n-3 FA via injectable n-3 triglycerides (TG) can influence microglial lipid metabolism to prevent or delay AD progression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized n-3 treatment effects on modulating lipid and metabolic homeostasis in microglia during the critical window of brain development. Our preliminary studies on determining the effects of early n-3 treatment on brain cell homeostasis indicate that perinatal bolus n-3 TG injections suppressed activation of gliosis-associated markers in young mice predisposed to AD (5xFAD) and yielded sustained regulatory effects on the expression of inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-6 (Il6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnfα), in adult brains. A significant increase in high-frequency ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) was observed in P6 5xFAD mice that received perinatal n-3 compared to vehicle control, implicating enhanced active communication patterns. Improvement in behavior deficits was observed in n-3-treated adult AD mice. Perinatal n-3 TG treatment modified brain lipid composition in young offspring, increasing key membrane lipid species, such as phospholipids (PL) and lysophospholipids (lysoPL). Pro-inflammatory sphingolipids associated with neurodegeneration, including lactosylceramide, were significantly lower in mice treated with n-3 than those in saline-treated AD mice.
CONCLUSION: Our study establishes a proof of principle for targeting brain immune cell metabolism with injectable n-3 TG to mitigate neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis, paving the way for future research into early treatments for related central nervous system (CNS) disorders.",Front Aging Neurosci
40016275,Serum-tolerant polymeric complex for stem-cell transfection and neural differentiation.,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy holds promise in biomedical applications but faces challenges in efficient transfection without compromising cell viability. Here, we show a serum-tolerant MSC transfection nanotool, APOs@BP, composed of an apolipoprotein (APO) corona and a boronated polyethyleneimine (BP) core. The APOs corona's serum-protein resistance and cytomembrane affinity enable APOs@BP to achieve 10.4-fold higher transfection efficiency and improved cytocompatibility in serum-containing medium compared to high-molecular-weight polycationic transfectants. For MSC neural differentiation, miRNA-124 and all-trans retinoic acid derivative (atRAN) are further loaded into APOs@BP, forming a polymeric complex for sequential drug release triggered by lysosomal acid and cytosolic reactive oxygen species post-transplantation. Transcriptomic analysis confirms that this system enhances MSC neural differentiation through sequential activation of atRAN-induced differentiation potential and miRNA-124-directed neurogenesis via cGMP-PKG, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt pathways. Transplantation of engineered MSCs reconstructs neural circuits and alleviates cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Collectively, this system provides a robust and convenient method for MSC-based regenerative medicine.",Nat Commun
40039671,Multimodal Dementia Screening from Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Conversational Speech.,"Early detection of Alzheimer's dementia is crucial for effective symptomatic treatment. Herein, we explore the opportunities of dementia screening based on automatically derived biomarkers from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and spoken communication. In particular, we compare the screening performance of unimodal MRI-based or speech-based markers with their multimodal counterparts. We use structural MRI data and interview recordings from the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging to analyze state and predictive screening between participants with and without cognitive impairment. We assess the effect of varying training set sizes on unimodal screening performance and compare screening performance of unimodal data with multimodal data, which are combined through Early, Late and Tensor Fusion. For both state and predictive screening, classifiers that combined both modalities with the Early Fusion method outperformed the single modalities, achieving an Unweighted Average Recall of 83.2% and 74.9%, respectively. On the evaluated dataset, markers derived from speech are just as useful for predictive screening as markers derived from MRI.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40110659,Connectome-based predictive modeling of brain pathology and cognition in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) through genetic mutations can result in near complete expression of the disease. Tracking AD pathology development in an ADAD cohort of Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) E280A carriers' mutation has allowed us to observe incipient tau tangles accumulation as early as 6 years prior to symptom onset.
METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans were acquired in a group of PSEN1 carriers (n = 32) and non-carrier family members (n = 35). We applied connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to examine the relationship between the participant's functional connectome and their respective tau/amyloid-β levels and cognitive scores (word list recall).
RESULTS: CPM models strongly predicted tau concentrations and cognitive scores within the carrier group. The connectivity patterns between the temporal cortex, default mode network, and other memory networks were the most informative of tau burden.
DISCUSSION: These results indicate that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods can complement PET methods in early detection and monitoring of disease progression in ADAD.

40034524,Neuropsychological and clinical indicators of Lewy body and Alzheimer's pathology.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) poses significant challenges due to pathological comorbidity. Similar ages of onset and overlapping cognitive and psychiatric symptoms can lead to diagnostic inaccuracy and inappropriate treatment recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: Identify the best combination of clinical and neuropsychological predictors of AD, DLB, and mixed DLB/AD neuropathology in dementia patients.
METHODS: Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we selected either pure AD (n = 189), DLB (n = 21), or mixed DLB/AD (n = 42) patients on autopsy. Neuropsychological and clinical predictors, including core clinical features of DLB, were entered into multivariable logistic regressions.
RESULTS: Gait disturbances (odds ratio (OR) = 19.32; p = 0.01), visual-spatial complaints (OR = 6.06; p = 0.03), and visual hallucinations (OR = 31.06; p = 0.002) predicted DLB compared to AD, along with better memory (OR = 3.42; p = 0.003), naming (OR = 3.35; p = 0.002), and worse processing speed (OR = 0.51; p = 0.01). When comparing DLB to DLB/AD, gait disturbances (OR = 6.33; p = 0.01), increased depressive symptoms (OR = 1.44; p = 0.03), and better memory (OR = 3.01; p = 0.004) predicted DLB. Finally, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (OR = 6.44; p = 0.004), parkinsonism severity (OR = 1.07; p = 0.02), and lower depressive symptoms (OR = 0.70; p = 0.006) and memory impairment (OR = 0.57; p = 0.02) distinguished DLB/AD from AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study converges with prior research suggesting specific neuropsychological and clinical features can help distinguish DLB from AD. Neuropsychological differentiation becomes more challenging among mixed pathologies and in advanced cognitive impairment, although the presence of RBD and parkinsonism distinguished DLB. Earlier clinical assessment and incorporation of in vivo and postmortem biomarkers should enhance diagnostic accuracy and understanding of disease characteristics, offering significant relevance for disease-modifying treatments.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40066444,The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
METHODS: We use quantitative RT-PCR to detect levels of NLR family members in AD mouse model. Additionally, we use immunofluorescence to detect NLRP3 expressions in microglia surrounding Aβ plaques in AD mouse model and human AD patients.
RESULTS: In this study, we examined the expression of NLR family members in the human AD database, and found increased levels of CIITA, NOD1, NLRC5, NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP10, NLRP12, and NLRP13 in hippocampus tissue in patients with AD, along with increased levels of NOD1, NLRC5, NLRX1, NLRP3, and NLRP7 levels in frontal cortex tissue. Furthermore, through detecting their levels in AD mouse model, we found that NLRP3 levels were significantly increased. Additionally, we found that NLRP3 expressions were mainly elevated in microglia surrounding Aβ plaques in AD mouse model and human AD patients.

40145301,"Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques.","INTRODUCTION: Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies.
METHOD: We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß).
RESULTS: Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Icosahedral display of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (pT181) Qß virus-like particle surface (""pT181-Qß"" vaccine) induces a robust immune response in mice and in non-human primates (NHPs) pT181-Qß vaccination reduces pathological tau (pTau) and brain atrophy, and improves memory and motor function in PS19 and hTau mice. pT181-Qß vaccination-induced immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) are safe, Th2 skewed (anti-inflammatory), specific to pTau in human AD brain, and efficiently engage pT181 in NHPs and human brain lysate. pT181<sup>+</sup> tau in human plasma correlates with the neurofilament light in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-suggesting the presence of pT181-Qß vaccine target in the early disease state.",Alzheimers Dement

This review explores the molecular intersections between synucleinopathies and amyloidogenesis. Furthermore, this review highlights how these pathways drive neuronal loss and suggest that targeting them could provide broad therapeutic benefits.

39992990,Nano-Collision Electrochemistry for Real-Time Monitoring of Amyloid-β Oligomerization and Rapid Screening of Degrading Drugs.,"Toxic oligomers of amyloid-β (Aβ) are important in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and degradation of Aβ oligomers (AβO) in the brain is considered a promising strategy for drug development. However, conventional drug screening techniques face challenges in the rapid and real-time assessment of AβO. Here, we report a simple and reliable nanocollision electrochemical method based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) ""tagging"" that can in situ monitor Aβ oligomerization and screen potential AβO-degrading drugs. The differences in collision signals between AgNPs-Aβ complexes and AgNPs were compared to achieve rapid identification of Aβ complexes with different aggregation degrees. The degradation effect following the addition of AβO-degrading drugs can be quickly evaluated by the recovery of collision frequency (f, number of peaks per unit time), which is effective if f &gt; 0.15. Degradation efficiency was further quantified using current lifetimes (τ, the time required for the current to decay to 1/e of the original), based on the percentage of τ ≤ 10 ms. The practicability of the method was tested using Aβ-degrading protease and several small molecules, confirming the rapid screening of AβO-degrading drugs and offering a novel strategy to accelerate the development of drugs for AD treatment.",Anal Chem

Based on our recent success in generating single human MAPT knock-in mouse models of FTDP-17, we describe the experimental basis for generating knock-in marmoset models of FTDP-17. In addition, successful generation of mutant PSEN1 knock-in marmoset models lacking exon 9 (PSEN1-Δ9) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates that we will be able to reconstitute two major pathological features of AD, i.e., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in an accelerated manner by combining these models.",J Alzheimers Dis
40145346,Commonly prescribed multi-medication therapies exert sex-specific effects on Alzheimer's disease pathology and metabolomic profiles in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice: Implications for personalized therapeutics in aging.,"INTRODUCTION: Polypharmacy is common among older adults and people with dementia. Multi-medication therapy poses risks of harm but also targets comorbidities and risk factors associated with dementia, offering therapeutic potential.
METHODS: We evaluated the effects of two polypharmacy regimens and monotherapies on male and female App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> knock-in mice. We assessed functional, emotional, and cognitive outcomes;amyloid pathology; and serum metabolomics profiles.
RESULTS: A combination of metoprolol, simvastatin, aspirin, paracetamol, and citalopram improved memory, reduced amyloid burden and neuroinflammation, and modulated AD-associated metabolomic signatures in male mice, with negligible effects in female mice. Substituting two cardiovascular drugs impacted emotional domains but worsened memory, predominantly in female mice. In males, monotherapies could not explain the combination effects, suggesting drug synergy, whereas in female mice, certain monotherapy effects were lost when combined.
DISCUSSION: This study uncovers the sex-specific effects of polypharmacy in an AD model, identifying mechanisms and biomarkers that can guide gender-specific use of medicines in dementia prevention and management.
HIGHLIGHTS: Two polypharmacy combinations show sex-specific effects on AD pathology and serum metabolomic profiles. Metoprolol+simvastatin+aspirin+paracetamol+citalopram improves memory and amyloid pathology in male mice. Replacing metoprolol and simvastatin with enalapril and atorvastatin eliminates benefits in male mice and impairs memory in female mice. Selected monotherapies produce sex-specific effects but only partially explain the outcomes of the combinations. Metabolomic pathways in serum indicate possible mechanisms and biomarkers for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of personalized therapies in aging and dementia.",Alzheimers Dement

Using the Streptozotocin (STZ) -induced rat model of AD, which replicates respiratory dysfunction and brain pathologies observed in human AD, we analyzed how these impairments relate to central neurological integration within the peripheral chemoreflex. Our focus was on glutamatergic signaling at the synapse between peripheral chemoafferents and second-order neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS), a critical brainstem center for respiratory control. Activating the peripheral chemoreflex with potassium cyanide (KCN) increased respiratory frequency. Response magnitudes to repeated KCN injections typically decreased over time, which was exacerbated in the STZ-AD group. Similarly, repeated glutamate nanoinjections into the caudal/commissural nTS caused a pronounced reduction of respiratory frequency responses in STZ-AD. Electrophysiological analysis of nTS neurons within the peripheral chemoreflex revealed increased network activity, enhanced excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by solitary tract stimulation (TS-EPSCs), and elevated asynchronous glutamate release following high-frequency stimulation (aEPSCs). These data were consistent with molecular evidence for astrogliosis (elevated GFAP expression), reduced astrocytic glutamate uptake (decreased EAAT2 expression), and presynaptic calcium dysregulation (increased TRPV1 expression). Additionally, presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3) were downregulated, while postsynaptic ionotropic receptor expression remained unchanged. With high-frequency solitary tract stimulation, STZ-AD rats had greater frequency-dependent TS-EPSC depression than controls, mirroring the diminished respiratory responses to KCN and glutamate nanoinjections. Our findings connect neurophysiological and molecular changes at the first nTS synapse of the peripheral chemoreflex with impaired respiratory responses to hypoxia in the STZ-AD model.",Exp Neurol
40084342,Neurostimulation devices to treat Alzheimer's disease.,"The use of neurostimulation devices for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing field. In this review, we examine the mechanism of action and therapeutic indications of these neurostimulation devices in the AD process. Rapid advancements in neurostimulation technologies are providing non-pharmacological relief to patients affected by AD pathology. Neurostimulation therapies include electrical stimulation that targets the circuitry-level connection in important brain areas such as the hippocampus to induce therapeutic neuromodulation of dysfunctional neural circuitry and electromagnetic field (EMF) stimulation that targets anti-amyloid molecular pathways to promote the degradation of beta-amyloid (Aβ). These devices target specific or diffuse cortical and subcortical brain areas to modulate neuronal activity at the electrophysiological or molecular pathway level, providing therapeutic effects for AD. This review attempts to determine the most effective and safe neurostimulation device for AD and provides an overview of potential and current clinical indications. Several EMF devices have shown a beneficial or harmful effect in cell cultures and animal models but not in AD human studies. These contradictory results may be related to the stimulation parameters of these devices, such as frequency, penetration depth, power deposition measured by specific absorption rate, time of exposure, type of cell, and tissue dielectric properties. Based on this, determining the optimal stimulation parameters for EMF devices in AD and understanding their mechanism of action is essential to promote their clinical application, our review suggests that repeated EMF stimulation (REMFS) is the most appropriate device for human AD treatments. Before its clinical application, it is necessary to consider the complicated and interconnected genetic and epigenetic effects of REMFS-biological system interaction. This will move forward the urgently needed therapy of EMF in human AD.",Explor Neurosci
40055292,Apolipoprotein E ε4-Specific Relationship Between Serum Olfactomedin 4 and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) plays important roles in inflammation, immune regulation, apoptosis, and neurodevelopment. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of serum OLFM4 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its clinical phenotype in different apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. Serum OLFM4 levels were measured in 122 AD patients and 113 healthy controls (HC). Correlations between OLFM4 levels and cognitive function and brain volume were analyzed in the context of APOE ε4 status. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess the contribution of high OLFM4 levels and APOE ε4 status to the risk of AD. It turns out that serum OLFM4 levels were significantly higher in patients with AD than in HC and were associated with APOE ε4 status but not sex. Serum OLFM4 levels showed a dose-response relationship with cognitive function and were correlated with brain atrophy. The combination of high OLFM4 levels and APOE ε4 expression was a risk factor for AD (odds ratio = 5.440; p = 0.017). In conclusion, serum OLFM4 may be involved in the pathology of AD and holds promise as a potential biomarker of AD as well as a therapeutic target. And the effects of OLFM4 for AD may be mediated by APOE ε4.",Mol Neurobiol
40030780,Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer-based Imbalanced Longitudinal Learning for Glaucoma Forecasting from Irregular Time Series Images.,"Glaucoma is one of the major eye diseases that leads to progressive optic nerve fiber damage and irreversible blindness, afflicting millions of individuals. Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MSTformer) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 96.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 88.2% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin. A series of ablation studies further verify the contribution of our proposed components in addressing the irregular sampled and class imbalanced problems.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40034517,Chronic exposure to a synthetic cannabinoid improves cognition and increases locomotor activity in Tg4-42 Alzheimer's disease mice.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and behavior impairments. Despite recent approvals of anti-amyloid antibodies, there remains a need for disease modifying and easily accessible therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system may hold promise for AD therapy as it plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, including learning, memory and anxiety, as well as inflammatory and immune responses.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 on memory deficits in Tg4-42 transgenic mice.
METHODS: Tg4-42 mice were assigned to two treatment groups to investigate the preventive effects of WIN 55,212-2 after a prolonged washout period, as well as the therapeutic effects of WIN 55,212-2 on behavior. Furthermore, the effects of WIN 55,212-2 treatment on AD pathology, including inflammation, amyloid-β load, neurogenesis, and brain glucose metabolism, were evaluated.
RESULTS: Therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 treatment rescued recognition memory and spatial reference deficits in Tg4-42 mice. Furthermore, therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 administration improved motor performance. In addition, preventative WIN 55,212-2 treatment rescued spatial learning and reference memory deficits. Importantly, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not affect anxiety-like behavior. However, therapeutic and preventative WIN 55,212-2 treatment resulted in an increase locomotor activity and swimming speed in Tg4-42 mice. WIN-treatment reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus of preventively treated mice and rescued brain glucose metabolism in therapeutically treated Tg4-42 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the therapeutic promise of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 in alleviating behavioral and cognitive deficits linked to AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
39994634,Beyond weight loss: exploring the neurological ramifications of altered gut microbiota post-bariatric surgery.,"This review discusses findings related to neurological disorders, gut microbiota, and bariatric surgery, focusing on neurotransmitters, neuroendocrine, the pathophysiology of bacteria contributing to disorders, and possible therapeutic interventions. Research on neurotransmitters suggests that their levels are heavily influenced by gut microbiota, which may link them to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Depression, and Autism spectrum disorder. The pathophysiology of bacteria that reach and influence the central nervous system has been documented. Trends in microbiota are often observed in specific neurological disorders, with a prominence of pro-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in anti-inflammatory types. Furthermore, bariatric surgery has been shown to alter microbiota profiles similar to those observed in neurological disorders. Therapeutic interventions, including fecal microbiota transplants and probiotics, have shown potential to alleviate neurological symptoms. We suggest a framework for future studies that integrates knowledge from diverse research areas, employs rigorous methodologies, and includes long-trial clinical control groups.",J Transl Med
40158531,Agreement of Medicare Part D and Minimum Data Set Reported Psychotropic Medication Use in Nursing Homes.,"OBJECTIVES: Little evidence exists on the accuracy of the Minimum Data Set (MDS)-based medication items. We compared quarterly rates of antipsychotic, antidepressant, and hypnotic use between the MDS and Part D Event file (PDE) in 2018.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All US Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing homes were included. Long-stay nursing home residents enrolled in Medicare Part D who were ≥65 years of age with psychiatric disorders or dementia identified in the MDS data (N = 580,340) were included. Two subcohorts included the following: residents with psychiatric disorders and no Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), and residents with ADRD.
METHODS: Psychotropic medication use was assessed using the share of study participants who received the medication in the quarter identified by the MDS. We used Cohen kappa to assess agreement in the share of residents using psychotropic medications during the quarter and used PDE data as a reference to calculate validity parameters.
RESULTS: The MDS-reported and PDE-reported antipsychotic (MDS vs PDE: 34.0% vs 34.3%) or antidepressant (MDS vs PDE: 73.4% vs 71.3%) users have high concordance as measured by the kappa value (antipsychotic: 0.9; antidepressant: 0.83). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MDS data compared with PDE were 96.7%, 92.8%, 96.3%, and 93.6% for antipsychotic, and 84.5%, 96.7%, 91.1%, and 94.0% for antidepressant. Only 3.7% of study participants identified in the MDS data, vs 32.6% of PDE-based users (kappa value: 0.1), used hypnotics. By combining antianxiety medications with hypnotics, the rates of MDS hypnotic or antianxiety users increased to 35.0% (kappa value: 0.74). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 89.5%, 85.6%, 92.8%, and 79.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Agreement between the MDS and PDE in antipsychotic and antidepressant use was high, suggesting that the MDS is a valid tool to measure antipsychotic and antidepressant use. Additional work is needed to understand the disagreements between MDS and PDE in hypnotic use.",J Am Med Dir Assoc
40041730,Climate change's impact on the nervous system: A review study.,"BACKGROUND: Global warming is caused by increased carbon dioxide and other industrial gases, which shift the climate of human habitat and environment, impacting human health globally. In this review, we tried to overview the current knowledge of climate change's impact on neurological disease.
METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus was conducted to find the relevant original studies. Language, sex, age, date, or country of study were not restricted. Included studies report increased Alzheimer's disease mortality and hospital admission.
RESULTS: This increase was seen from the first day with high temperature to 3-4 days later. Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects were more vulnerable to high temperatures compared to dementia patients (RR for dementia: 1.29 and for PD: 1.41). Global warming was linked to the increase in the incidence of Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) (from 0.1% to 5.4%), Japanese encephalitis (OR: 2 when floods occur), and ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) (RR: 1.62 for each 1 <sup>◦</sup>C increase per month).
CONCLUSION: Health-related consequences of climate change are inevitable. The burden of medical problems related to the elderly population (especially the elderly with dementia), infectious diseases, and CFP on the healthcare system will naturally increase. Studying global warming trends could empower us with more precise predictions of the future and better planning to face climate change-related challenges.",Health Promot Perspect
40164395,ACE-dependent Alzheimer's disease: Further assessment of the impact of ACE mutations on blood ACE levels.,"BACKGROUND: Carriers of damaging mutations in the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) that result in low ACE levels may be at increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured blood ACE levels in EDTA-plasma from 74 subjects with 12 different heterozygous ACE mutations. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to ACE and two ACE substrates, we assessed the impact of these mutations on ACE phenotypes. We identified several mutations spanning both ACE domains, including the most frequent mutation, Y215C, that significantly reduce blood ACE levels. Therefore, these mutations may serve as potential risk factors for late-onset AD. Additionally, two mutations tested, G325R and E738K, altered ACE catalytic properties. We also found that the binding of certain mAbs to mutant ACEs could serve as markers for these and other ACE mutations. This would enable monitoring the fate of mutant ACEs in the blood during potential future therapies, particularly in the case of transport-deficient ACE mutations. The interaction between ACE and amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ42) was studied using molecular modeling, which predicts which ACE mutations may influence Aβ42 hydrolysis, and consequently increase the risk of AD development.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Systematic analysis of blood ACE levels in patients with ACE mutations holds promise for identifying individuals at increased risk of late-onset AD. Patients with ACE mutations affecting transport efficiency may potentially benefit from therapeutic strategies combining chemical and pharmacological chaperones with proteasome inhibitors, as demonstrated previously in a cellular model of the transport-deficient ACE mutation Q1069R.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis

Platelets regulate blood hemostasis and play key roles in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. miR-26a-5p and GP1b may affect platelet functions (PF), with miR-26a-5p as a diagnostic/therapeutic target and GP1b linking vascular and neurological disorders in AD progression.ObjectiveThis study explores the roles of GP1b and hsa-miR-26a-5p in regulating PF in AD.Methods85 participants, including 43 AD, and 45 controls, were included. PF induced by ADP were assessed by optical density and white matter changes by MRI Axial FLAIR. Serum levels of von Willebrand Factor and GP1b were measured by ELISA. Platelet receptor expressions of CD62P and CD42b (GPIb) were measured by flow cytometry, and levels of hsa-miR-26a-5p and hsa-miR-24-3p by qRT-PCR.ResultsADP-induced PF was significantly reduced in AD (p = 0.016). Flow cytometry showed significantly low CD42b and high CD62P expression in AD, respectively (p < 0.0001, p = 0.014). Serum GP1b levels were significantly higher in AD (p = 0.018). Additionally, hsa-miR-26a-5p expression was significantly low in AD (p = 0.001), and a positive correlation was found between the expression levels of hsa-miR-24-3p and hsa-miR-26a-5p in both controls; and AD (r = 0.4149, p = 0.0051, 95% CI = 0.1256-0.6392; r = 0.6820, p = 0.0023, 95% CI 0.4728-0.8184).ConclusionsThis study highlights increased serum GP1b levels with decreased both platelet surface GP1b levels and hsa-miR-26a-5p expressions in AD. GP1b and hsa-miR-26a-5p might have essential roles on PF in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis

It catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, the primary pathway for CNS cholesterol clearance. Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

40009555,"The Interaction of Shock Waves With Biological Tissue - Momentum Transfer, the Key for Tissue Stimulation and Fragmentation.","BACKGROUND: Shock waves in medicine have gained enormous importance and have spread since 1980, and the first kidney stone was successfully fragmented in a patient in Munich. Meanwhile, the spectrum of medical applications of shock waves ranges from powerful fragmentation of kidney stones to diverse indications such as wound healing, chronic pelvic pain, spasticity, erectile dysfunction, and others, to neuro-stimulation in the context of Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive working mechanism for this diverse field of medical indications are still missing.
OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the physical basis of the working mechanism of shock waves in medical applications.
METHODS: We developed a model based on the mechanical forces generated by the momentum transfer at the acoustic interfaces of different layers of biological tissue. The generated forces are strong enough to crash brittle material and provide an adequate mechanical stimulus to activate mechano-transduction and mechano-sensory-transduction with nerve stimulation, thereby affecting the neural memory function of the central nervous system.
RESULTS: The key to generating appropriate forces in the millisecond range is the mechanism of momentum transfer at the interfaces between tissue layers with different acoustic impedances. According to Newton´s laws of motion, a change in momentum (momentum transfer) generates force F = dP/dt. The inherent shear forces can stretch biological membranes to release biomolecules such as VEGF and NO. A most favourable feature of this mechanism is the selective effect on soft tissue interfaces and small tissue inhomogeneities to generate small forces in the range of few (≤ 10) Newton to stimulate tissue and nerve cells, while the same shock wave can generate forces ≥ 200 Newton and more on hard tissue interfaces such as bones or stones.
CONCLUSION: The mechanism of momentum transfer is the basis for mechano-transduction and mechano-sensory transduction. It offers the opportunity to stimulate peripheral nerves and modify the motor reflex patterns of ""pathologic"" reflexes by hyper stimulation. The new technique of transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) may be based on direct stimulation and reactivation of neurons in the brain. Momentum transfer is the basic physical mechanism and the initiator for successive biological processes in medical shock wave therapy.",Int J Surg
40164520,CaMKII mechanisms that promote pathological LTP impairments.,"The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is extremely abundant in the brain, where it prominently mediates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to be required for learning and memory. However, CaMKII also mediates LTP impairments related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and global cerebral ischemia (GCI), two conditions that are very distinct but are both associated with impairments in learning and memory. In both cases, CaMKII inhibitors prevented these LTP impairments. Thus, CaMKII actively mediates both physiological LTP and the pathological LTP impairments related to AD and GCI. Notably, these active LTP impairment mechanisms are in stark contrast to other conditions, like normal aging, where milder LTP impairments are caused instead by passive lack of CaMKII function.",Curr Opin Neurobiol
40045432,Structural and functional studies of the VAPB-PTPIP51 ER-mitochondria tethering proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria regulates many of the seemingly disparate physiological functions that are damaged in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A number of studies have now demonstrated that ER-mitochondria signaling is perturbed in these diseases and there is evidence that this may be a driving mechanism in disease onset and progression. VAPB and PTPIP51 are ER-mitochondria tethering proteins; VAPB is an ER protein and PTPIP51 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein and the two proteins interact to enable inter-organelle signaling. The VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, FTD and ALS. Here we review the roles of VAPB and PTPIP51 in ER-mitochondria signaling and the mechanisms by which neurodegenerative disease insults may disrupt the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction.",Acta Neuropathol Commun
39995985,Potential role of ghrelin in neuroprotection and cognitive function: implications for diabetic cognitive impairment.,"Ghrelin is a class of brain and intestinal peptides. It regulates food intake and body glucose levels and maintains cellular homeostasis. In recent years, research has revealed that ghrelin may positively impact learning and memory. Despite ghrelin's multiple functions in the central nervous system, its use as a therapeutic agent for neurologic dysfunction remains unclear. Diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI) is a severe neurological complication of diabetes mellitus. Its incidence is increasing as a comorbidity in endocrinology and neurology. Additionally, it is a risk factor for Alzheimer' s disease (AD). Ghrelin levels are altered in patients with diabetes mellitus combined with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, modulation of ghrelin levels improved cognitive function in rats with DCI. These findings suggest the potential therapeutic importance of ghrelin in the pathogenesis of DCI. This article presents a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of DCI and its potential modulation by ghrelin and its mimics. Furthermore, this study elucidates the therapeutic prospects of ghrelin and its mimics for DCI, aiming to identify novel therapeutic targets and research avenues for the prevention and management of DCI in the future.",PeerJ
40110684,Marital status and risk of dementia over 18 years: Surprising findings from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.,"INTRODUCTION: Marital status is a potential risk/protective factor for adverse health outcomes. This study tested whether marital status was associated with dementia risk in older adults.
METHODS: Participants (N = 24,107; Mean<sub>age </sub>= 71.79) were from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Cox regressions tested the association between baseline marital status and clinically ascertained dementia over up to 18 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared to married participants, widowed (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.67-0.79), divorced (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.59-0.73), and never-married participants (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.52-0.71) were at lower dementia risk, including for Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. The associations for divorced and never married remained significant accounting for demographic, behavioral, clinical, genetic, referral source, participation, and diagnostic factors. The associations were slightly stronger among professional referrals, males, and relatively younger participants.
DISCUSSION: Unmarried individuals may have a lower risk of dementia compared to married adults. The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals or challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Widowed, divorced, and never-married older adults had a lower dementia risk, compared to their married counterparts. Unmarried older adults were also at a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, with a pattern of mixed findings for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and no associations with risk of vascular dementia or mild cognitive impairment. All unmarried groups were at a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There was some evidence of moderation by age, sex, and referral source. However, stratified analyses showed small differences between groups, and most interactions were not significant, suggesting that the role of marital status in dementia tends to be similar across individuals at different levels of dementia risk due to education, depression, and genetic vulnerability.",Alzheimers Dement
40063426,Weighted Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning Based Hybrid Network for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Multiple imaging modalities and specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, providing a comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, have been widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the proven effectiveness of contrastive learning in aligning multi-modal representation, in this paper, we investigate effective contrastive learning strategies to learn better cross-modal representations for the integration of multi-modal complementary information. To enhance the overall performance in AD diagnosis, we construct a unified hybrid network that integrates feature learning and classifier learning into an end-to-end framework. Specifically, we propose a weighted multi-modal contrastive learning based on hybrid network (WMCL-HN) method. Firstly, an adaptive weighted strategy is implemented on the multi-modal contrastive learning to dynamically regulate the degree of information exchange across modalities. It assigns higher weights to more important modality pair, thus the most important underlying relationships across modalities can be captured. Secondly, we construct a hybrid network, which employs a curriculum learning strategy that gradually transitions the training from feature learning to classifier learning, ensuring that the learned features are tailored to the diagnostic task. Experimental results on ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WMCL-HN in AD-related diagnosis tasks.

39997657,Therapeutic Role of Heterocyclic Compounds in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Insights from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are the most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). The development of aberrant protein aggregates and the progressive and permanent loss of neurons are the major characteristic features of these disorders. Although the precise mechanisms causing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown, there is a wealth of evidence suggesting that misfolded proteins, accumulation of misfolded proteins, dysfunction of neuroreceptors and mitochondria, dysregulation of enzymes, and the release of neurotransmitters significantly influence the pathophysiology of these diseases. There is no effective protective medicine or therapy available even with the availability of numerous medications. There is an urgent need to create new and powerful bioactive compounds since the number of people with NDDs is rising globally. Heterocyclic compounds have consistently played a pivotal role in drug discovery due to their exceptional pharmaceutical properties. Many clinically approved drugs, such as galantamine hydrobromide, donepezil hydrochloride, memantine hydrochloride, and opicapone, feature heterocyclic cores. As these heterocyclic compounds have exceptional therapeutic potential, heterocycles are an intriguing research topic for the development of new effective therapeutic drugs for PD and AD. This review aims to provide current insights into the development and potential use of heterocyclic compounds targeting diverse therapeutic targets to manage and potentially treat patients with AD and PD.",Neurol Int
40038800,Improving vulnerable Calbindin1<sup>-</sup> neurons in the ventral hippocampus rescues tau-induced impairment of episodic memory.,"BACKGROUND: Intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the significant correlation between tau pathology and memory loss in AD patients, identifying vulnerable brain regions, particularly susceptible neuron types in these regions, will advance our understanding of AD onset and shed light on therapeutic strategies to manage its progression.
METHODS: Immunofluorescent staining was employed to identify the brain regions and neuron types vulnerable to tau pathology in AD. A combination of chemogenetics, electrophysiological recording, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> recording, and a modified temporal-order discrimination behavior test was utilized to investigate the toxicity of tau accumulation to susceptible neurons in the dorsal part of the ventral hippocampus. Proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and molecular targeting were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of neuron susceptibility to tau accumulation in AD. The beneficial effects of microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) knockdown and administration of DEPhosphorylation TArgeting Chimera (DEPTAC) were evaluated in AD mice with tau pathology.
RESULTS: In postmortem brains of AD patients, we observed robust accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the anterior hippocampal CA1 region, particularly in its Calbindin1<sup>-</sup> (Calb1<sup>-</sup>) neurons, as opposed to the posterior hippocampal CA1 region and Calb1<sup>+</sup> neurons. The susceptibility of Calb1<sup>-</sup> neurons to phospho-tau accumulation was also observed in P301L mice, especially in the dorsal part of ventral (anterior in human) hippocampal CA1 (dvCA1). In P301L mice, dvCA1 displayed distinct protein and phosphorylated protein networks compared with dorsal CA1, accompanied by overactivation of MARK4. Overexpressing human tau in Calb1<sup>-</sup> neurons in the dvCA1 (dvCA1<sup>Calb1-</sup> neurons) specifically impairs the temporal-order discrimination of objects. Meanwhile, tau accumulation significantly inhibited the excitability and firing patterns of dvCA1<sup>Calb1-</sup> neurons associated with temporal-order discrimination. Knocking down MARK4 or reducing hyperphosporylated tau via DEPTAC in P301L mice significantly ameliorated AD-like tau pathology in dvCA1<sup>Calb1-</sup> neurons and improved temporal-order discrimination of objects.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the crucial role of dvCA1<sup>Calb1-</sup> neurons in the early stage of tau pathology and demonstrate the potential of targeting phosphorylated tau through MARK4 knockdown or DEPTAC administration to counter the vulnerability of dvCA1<sup>Calb1-</sup> neurons and, consequently, ameliorate episodic memory deficits in AD.",Transl Neurodegener
40119826,The Association of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment With Outpatient Ambulatory Care Utilization in the Community.,"BACKGROUND: Ambulatory care is critical in delivering interventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from basic services to novel therapeutics. Yet, little is known regarding how community-dwelling persons with dementia/MCI interact with clinicians in outpatient ambulatory settings. We assessed associations of dementia/MCI with outpatient ambulatory evaluation and management (E&M) visits.
METHODS: We included 2116 community-dwelling participants in Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts, with linked fee-for-service Medicare claims. Annually from 2011 to 2019, cohort neuropsychologic evaluations classified participants as dementia, MCI, or no cognitive impairment (NCI). Across groups, we compared annual probability of visiting providers and number of E&M visits, using repeated measures logistic or generalized Poisson mixed effects models.
RESULTS: Across 8672 person-years (PY) of follow-up, the mean age was 82 (SD 7.6) years; 77% of PYs were among females and 24% among Black participants. Controlling for demographics and comorbidity, the annual predicted probability of primary care visits was high in all groups (86%-92%). Although there were few visits with dementia-related specialists, we found a higher probability of these visits among those with dementia (15%) and MCI (17%) than NCI (12%; p = 0.009, dementia vs. NCI; p < 0.001, MCI vs. NCI). There were striking differences in visits to other medical specialties: the mean number of annual visits was 40% lower for those with dementia (p < 0.001) and 10% lower for MCI (p < 0.001) than NCI. Overall, dementia and MCI were associated with 19% (p < 0.001) and 4% (p = 0.005) fewer E&M visits, respectively, compared to NCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with dementia and MCI interact with primary care providers regularly and are more likely to use dementia-related specialists than those with NCI. Yet, we found lower utilization of other medical specialties, without compensatory increases in primary care, leading to fewer overall E&M visits, even in MCI.

Traditional diagnostic methods for AD and OSA, like cerebrospinal fluid analysis and polysomnography, are invasive and challenging for people with DS. In this study, we assessed whether facial morphology could be used as a potential noninvasive biomarker for these conditions in both DS and the general population. We performed a comprehensive 3D analysis of facial shape variation by registering the 3D coordinates of 21 landmarks on facial models extracted from magnetic resonance images of 131 individuals with DS and 216 euploid (EU) adult controls, including AD and OSA cases. Procrustes ANOVA and MANOVA quantified shape variation by sex, age, and facial size, while geometric morphometrics assessed diagnostic group differences. Significant facial shape differences were observed between the DS and EU groups, indicating sex-dependent differences and altered age-related changes in DS, particularly in females. Facial shape correlated with the amyloid beta ratio (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40), a key AD biomarker. In DS, facial shape differences by AD diagnosis were not significant after adjusting for age and facial size, but significant shape differences were detected in the EU population. For OSA, facial shape correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and DS individuals with severe OSA showed distinct facial morphology compared with those without OSA, suggesting an association between facial shape and sleep respiratory disturbances. These results highlight the potential of facial morphology as a noninvasive biomarker for AD and OSA detection and management.",FASEB J
40168089,"The Association of Circulating Immune Cells with Cognitive Function, Brain Imaging, and Incident all-cause and Alzheimer's Dementia: The Framingham Offspring Study.","BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence supports the central role of the immune system in brain health, yet little is known about the role of circulating immune cells and cognitive function or brain health in dementia-free populations. We investigated the association of 43 immune cells with cognitive function, structural brain imaging, and incident dementia in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants.
METHODS: Immune cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Linear mixed effects models were used for cross-sectional associations between immune cells and four cognitive domain scores and 13 brain MRI measurements. Cox proportional hazards regression models tested the relationship between immune cells and time to dementia. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, CMV status, and APOE genotype, with further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Data was further stratified by CMV status.
RESULTS: Among 795 participants with cellular phenotyping, cognitive testing and brain imaging data (mean age 61, 52% women), there were no associations between immune cells and cognitive test scores. Several significant associations between immune cells and regional brain MRI measurements were observed. Higher CD8+ cells [CD8+CD45RO-CCR7-CD27-(Teff), CD8+CD45RA+CD28-CD57+(TEMRA), CD8+CD27-CD28-] associated with greater cerebrum gray and frontal gray matter volumes and inclusion of cardiovascular risk factors strengthened the association. Among CMV+ participants, CD8+TEMRA and CD8+Teff cells were significantly associated with higher total gray and frontal gray matter volumes. No significant associations were observed between immune cells and incident all-cause or Alzheimer's disease dementia.
CONCLUSION: The pathobiology underpinning the associations between immune cells and brain volumes require further study and validation in diverse samples.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci
40149595,"Genomic Characterisation of the Relationship and Causal Links Between Vascular Calcification, Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Traits.","Background/Objectives: Observational studies suggest a link between vascular calcification and dementia or cognitive decline, but the evidence is conflicting, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigate the shared genetic and causal relationships of vascular calcification-coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC)-with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and five cognitive traits. Methods: We analyse large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, using well-regarded methods, including linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), Mendelian randomisation (MR), pairwise GWAS (GWAS-PW), and gene-based association analysis. Results: Our findings reveal a nominally significant positive genome-wide genetic correlation between CAC and AD, which becomes non-significant after excluding the APOE region. CAC and AAC demonstrate significant negative correlations with cognitive performance and educational attainment. MR found no causal association between CAC or AAC and AD or cognitive traits, except for a bidirectional borderline-significant association between AAC and fluid intelligence scores. Pairwise-GWAS analysis identifies no shared causal SNPs (posterior probability of association [PPA]3 &lt; 0.5). However, we find pleiotropic loci (PPA4 &gt; 0.9), particularly on chromosome 19, with gene association analyses revealing significant genes in shared regions, including APOE, TOMM40, NECTIN2, and APOC1. Moreover, we identify suggestively significant loci (PPA4 &gt; 0.5) on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9 and 19, implicating pleiotropic genes, including NAV1, IPO9, PHACTR1, UFL1, FHL5, and FOCAD. Conclusions: Current findings reveal limited genetic correlation and no significant causal associations of CAC and AAC with AD or cognitive traits. However, significant pleiotropic loci, particularly at the APOE region, highlight the complex interplay between vascular calcification and neurodegenerative processes. Given APOE's roles in lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and vascular integrity, its involvement may link vascular and neurodegenerative disorders, pointing to potential targets for further investigation.",Biomedicines
40111934,Lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis indirectly induce neuronal GSK3β-dependent synaptic defects and cause cognitive decline in a low-amyloid-β-concentration environment in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundLipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gLPS) are involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of P.gLPS on synaptic defects remains unclear.ObjectiveIn this study, we tested our hypothesis that P.gLPS induces synaptic defects in a low-amyloid-beta (Aβ)-concentration environment.MethodsMG6 microglia or N2a neurons was treated with P.gLPS (0.1 μg/mL), soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub> (0.1 μM) or AL (combined P.gLPS and soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub> at 0.1 μM).ResultsIn cultured MG6 microglia, increased the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and the TNF-α release in parallel with increased NF-κB activation. In cultured N2a neurons, treatment with Aβ<sub>42</sub>, P.gLPS, and AL did not affect the mRNA expression of synapsin1 (SYN1) or post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). However, the treatment with conditioned medium from AL-exposed MG6 microglia (AL-MCM) significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of SYN1, PSD-95, and nuclear translocation of repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) but significantly increased the mRNA expression of TNF receptor type I (at 48 h) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β (at 24 h). TWS119 pretreatment (5 μM), a GSK3β specific inhibitor, significantly reversed the AL-MCM-induced reduction in the mRNA expression of SYN1 and PSD-95 and nuclear translocation of REST in cultured N2a neurons. In APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mice, the immunofluorescence intensity of SYN1 and PSD-95 in cortical neurons was positively correlated with the index of the memory test but negatively correlated with that of TNF-α-positive microglia.ConclusionsThese observations demonstrate that P.gLPS induces neuronal GSK3β-dependent synaptic defects in a low-Aβ concentration environment via microglial activation.",J Alzheimers Dis
40001370,The Role of Amphibian AMPs Against Oxidative Stress and Related Diseases.,"Amphibians use their skin as an effective defense mechanism against predators and microorganisms. Specialized glands produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that possess antioxidant properties, effectively reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These peptides are promising candidates for treating diseases associated with oxidative stress (OS) and redox imbalance, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as age-related conditions, like cardiovascular diseases and cancer. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of AMPs and antioxidant peptides (AOPs) in amphibians, emphasizing their protective capabilities against oxidative damage. They scavenge ROS, activate antioxidant enzyme systems, and inhibit cellular damage. AOPs often share structural characteristics with AMPs, suggesting a potential evolutionary connection and similar biosynthetic pathways. Peptides such as brevinin-1FL and Cath-KP demonstrate neuroprotective effects, indicating their therapeutic potential in managing oxidative stress-related diseases. The antioxidant properties of amphibian-derived peptides pave the way for novel therapeutic developments. However, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these peptides and their interactions with oxidative stress is essential to addressing ROS-related diseases and advancing therapeutic strategies in clinical practice.",Antibiotics (Basel)
40057101,Enhanced social interaction protects cognition by preserving synapse numbers.,"BACKGROUND: According to the NIA-AA guidelines, pathological diagnosis as Intermedia (I) or High (H) via ABC scores qualifies as pathological Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple studies indicated that some individuals, while pathologically diagnosed with AD, maintain normal cognitive function during their lifetime, here defined as resilient AD (rAD). In contrast to typical AD (tAD), characterized by both pathological AD diagnosis and dementia, rAD brains exhibited no significant differences in AD pathology but showed increased synapse numbers. To date, there is limited systematic reporting on the epidemiology and protective factors for rAD.
METHODS: This study surveyed reports from multiple global centers to estimate the prevalence of rAD within the pathological AD population. Based on the PUMC Human Brain Bank, I analyzed risk factors and gene mutations associated with dementia severity in pathological AD. Additionally, mouse models were employed to explore the protective effects of enhanced social interaction on cognitive function in pathological AD.
RESULTS: Analysis of multiple global cohorts revealed that rAD accounted for 25-36 % of pathological AD cases. Analysis of the PUMC Human Brain Bank indicated that the severity of dementia in pathological AD was not associated with age or gender. However, the tAD group showed a significantly higher prevalence of social isolation. Genetic analysis suggested that TREM2 rs2234255 GG > CC and APP rs281865161 TC > GG may be risk variants for cognitive impairment in pathological AD, while CLU rs9331896 CC > TT may serve as a protective variant for cognitive resilience. In 5 × FAD mice, increased social interaction did not significantly alter Aβ pathology progression but reduced synaptic loss, thereby improving cognitive function.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that promoting emotional care and social interaction for the elderly may help slow cognitive decline in AD patients.",Brain Res
40070795,Depletion of nuclear cytoophidia in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is considerable evidence for a role for metabolic dysregulation, including disordered purine nucleotide metabolism, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Purine nucleotide synthesis in the brain is regulated with high fidelity to co-ordinate supply with demand. The assembly of some purine biosynthetic enzymes into linear filamentous aggregates called ""cytoophidia"" (Gk. Cellular ""snakes"") represents one post-translational mechanism to regulate enzyme activity. Cytoophidia comprised of the nucleotide biosynthetic enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS) have been described in neuronal nuclei (nuclear cytoophidia; NCs). In light of the involvement of purine nucleotide dysmetabolism in AD, the rationale for this study was to determine whether there are disease-specific qualitative or quantitative alterations in PRPS cytoophidia in the AD brain. Double fluorescence immunostaining for PRPS and the neuronal marker MAP2 was performed on tissue microarrays of cores of temporal cortex extracted from post-mortem tissue blocks from a large cohort of participants with neuropathologically confirmed AD, Lewy body disease (LBD), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration, as well as age-matched cognitively unimpaired control participants. The latter group included individuals with substantial beta-amyloid deposition. NCs were significantly reduced in frequency in AD samples relative to those from controls, including those with a high beta-amyloid load, or participants with LBD or 4 repeat tauopathies. Moreover, double staining for PRPS and hyperphosphorylated tau revealed evidence for an association between NCs and neurofibrillary tangles. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of metabolic contributions to AD pathogenesis and provide a novel avenue for future studies. Moreover, because PRPS filamentation is responsive to a variety of drugs and metabolites, they may have implications for the development of biologically rational therapies.",Free Neuropathol
40077816,Prenatal Stress Increases the Risk of the FPR2-related Dysfunction in the Brain's Resolution of Inflammation: A Study on the Humanized APPNL-F/NL-F Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain aging is a complex process involving genetic, neurodevelopmental, and environmental factors. Inherent features of this process are cellular senescence, the development of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and prolonged inflammation.
METHODS: Recently, progress has been made in understanding the biological roles of FPR2 receptors and their ligands in the mechanism of inflammation resolution (RoI) in the brain. However, the number of studies comparing the influence of prenatal stress (PS) on RoI in physiological aging and neurodegenerative disorders pathology is very limited, and the data need to be more consistent. Here, we examined whether PS can condition the pattern of age-dependent cognitive and RoI changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in wild-type and hAPPNL-F/NL-F KI male mice.
RESULTS: We discovered that in aging, the memory deficits are accompanied by the limitation of the availability of pro-resolving FPR2 ligands, the rising proinflammatory microglia polarization, and inflammatory ligands mediated FPR2 overactivation. Moreover, the present study suggested the subtle role of the RoI deficits in creating brain cells' senescence and shifting the immunomodulators to the proinflammatory direction. PS has been revealed as a substantial factor modulating the profile of inflame-aging in a manner strongly determined by the age of animals and the brain structure under study, mainly in hAPPNL-F/NL-F KI male mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results identify the FPR2 receptors as a driver regulating the RoI process in the brain and highlight that PS has diversified the picture of age-dependent neurodegenerative pathology.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40033775,Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging analysis of early mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) represents a prodromal stage of dementia, and early detection is crucial for delaying dementia progression. However, accurately identifying its neuroimaging features remains challenging.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate structural and functional neuroimaging changes in EMCI using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.
METHODS: One hundred and eleven participants were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): 36 with cognitively normal (CN), 30 with EMCI, 32 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 13 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). FreeSurfer software was employed to segment hippocampal and amygdala subregions. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity were processed using Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging toolbox. Graph Theoretical Network Analysis toolbox was utilized to evaluate global functional network.
RESULTS: The volume of most hippocampal and amygdala subregions was decreased in AD group than those of EMCI group in structural MRI. Significant differences were found between EMCI and AD group in fALFF (right insula) and ReHo (bilateral caudate regions). EMCI group exhibited stronger functional connectivity between left hippocampus and right inferior temporal gyrus (compared to CN), left inferior temporal gyrus (compared to LMCI), and cerebellum crus 8 (compared to AD). EMCI group exhibited stronger connectivity between right hippocampus and left anterior cingulate gyrus compared to AD. Network metrics showed no significant differences among these groups, but all exhibited small-world properties.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal MRI analysis revealed the neuroimaging characteristics of EMCI and promoted the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuroimaging changes in EMCI.",J Alzheimers Dis
39997049,"The Role of Cortisol and Dehydroepiandrosterone in Obesity, Pain, and Aging.","Obesity, chronic pain, and aging are prevalent global challenges with profound implications for health and well-being. Central to these processes are adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), along with its sulfated form (DHEAS). Cortisol, essential for stress adaptation, can have adverse effects on pain perception and aging when dysregulated, while DHEA/S possess properties that may mitigate these effects. This review explores the roles of cortisol and DHEA/S in the contexts of obesity, acute and chronic pain, aging, and age-related diseases. We examine the hormonal balance, specifically the cortisol-to-DHEA ratio (CDR), as a key marker of stress system functionality and its impact on pain sensitivity, neurodegeneration, and physical decline. Elevated CDR and decreased DHEA/S levels are associated with worsened outcomes, including increased frailty, immune dysfunction, and the progression of age-related conditions such as osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. This review synthesizes the current literature to highlight the complex interplay between these hormones and their broader implications for health. It aims to provide insights into potential future therapies to improve pain management and promote healthy weight and aging. By investigating these mechanisms, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the physiological intersections between pain, aging, and the endocrine system.",Diseases
39996714,Effects of Microplastic Accumulation on Neuronal Death After Global Cerebral Ischemia.,"Brain ischemia, a condition in which the brain is deprived of blood flow, can lead to a stroke due to blocked or unstable blood vessels. Global cerebral ischemia (GCI), characterized by an interruption in blood flow, deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger cell death, which kills nerve cells. Microplastics (MPs), tiny environmental pollutants, can enter the human body through contaminated food, water, disposable items, cosmetics, and more. Once in the brain, MPs can increase neuroinflammation by overstimulating inflammatory factors such as microglia. MPs can also damage neurons by scratching myelin and microtubules, slowing signal transduction, causing cognitive impairment, and leading to neuronal death. Furthermore, microtubule damage may result in the release of phosphorylated tau proteins, potentially linked to Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that MPs could exacerbate neuroinflammation and microtubule destruction after GCI, leading to increased neuronal death. To test this hypothesis, we administered MPs (0.5 µm) orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg before and after inducing GCI. Staining techniques such as Fluoro-Jade B (FJB), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), myelin basic protein (MBP), and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) were used, along with Western blot analysis for interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, tau-5, and phospho-tau (S396) to evaluate the effects of MPs on neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation, and microtubule destruction. The results showed that MP accumulation significantly increased neuroinflammation, microtubule disruption, and neuronal cell death in the GCI-MP group compared to the GCI-vehicle group. Therefore, this study suggests that MP accumulation in daily life may contribute to the exacerbation of the disease, potentially leading to severe neuronal cell death after GCI.",Cells
40039602,3D Multi-feature fusion convolutional network for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"The cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the structural changes in the hippocampus captured by structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). However, current deep model research on the morphological analysis of hippocampus is mainly based on 2D MRI slices, lacking a comprehensive description of the 3D surface morphology and complex textures of the hippocampus. For this reason, we propose a two-stream multi features deep learning model that establishes a descriptive system for 3D spatial structure and morphological atrophy features on the triangular mesh of left and right hippocampus. First, we encode the triangular mesh data into the spatial structural features of the hippocampal surface. Second, considering the tubular structure of the hippocampus and the inhomogeneous morphological changes caused by AD, we introduce the thickness features and Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) features for the morphological atrophy features encoding. Third, we integrate the encoded features of adjacent faces from a macroscopic perspective into the discriminative morphological features induced by AD. Finally, driven by classification tasks, the deep learning model parameters and the discriminative features are continuously optimized, thereby improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis. Our method is evaluated based on the T 1 weighted sMRI baseline data of 269 Aβ+ AD and 437 Aβ-normal cognitively(NC) subjects collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The classification accuracy of this method for AD and NC subjects is 93.4%, the sensitivity and specificity are 92.4% and 93.8%, respectively, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 98.3%.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40014257,Neuroprotective Effects of Berberine Chloride Against the Aluminium Chloride-Induced Alzheimer's Disease in Zebra Fish Larvae.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease distinguished by cognitive and memory deficits. A lack of memory, cognition, and other forms of cognitive dissonance characterizes AD, which affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. This study aimed to identify the neuroprotective effects of berberine chloride (BC) against aluminium chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>)-induced AD in zebrafish larvae by inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. BC toxicity was assessed by evaluating survival rates, malformations, and heart rates in zebrafish larvae following treatment with varying concentrations of BC. This study elucidates the mechanisms of BC through an extensive range of biochemical assays, behavioral testing, and molecular docking analysis. The developmental toxicity assessment of BC indicated that doses up to 40 μM did not cause any developmental abnormalities until 96 h post fertilization. The LC<sub>50</sub> value of BC in zebrafish larvae was found to be 50.16 μM. The biochemical and behavioral changes induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub> in zebrafish larvae were significantly mitigated by BC treatment. Our findings demonstrate that BC can reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced AD zebrafish larvae. Our molecular docking results indicated that BC significantly interacted with the ABCA1 protein, suggesting that BC may act as an ABCA1 agonist. Based on our results, it can be concluded that BC may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for mitigating oxidative stress by altering cholesterol metabolism in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced AD.",Mol Biotechnol
40120784,GSK-3β dysregulation in aging: Implications for tau pathology and Alzheimer's disease progression.,"The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for linking amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau pathology. The activity of GSK-3β is dysregulated in the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and production of Aβ by modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. This review discusses the mechanisms controlling GSK-3β dysregulation in aging and its influence on AD progression, focusing on the role of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and defective signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and Wnt. Critical analysis is presented for therapeutic strategies targeting GSK-3β using natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, geniposide) and emerging approaches such as TREM2 modulation and miRNA therapies. In preclinical models, these interventions promise to reduce Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ burden, along with associated neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, achieving selective GSK-3β inhibition and optimizing drug delivery are still critical barriers to clinical translation. This review underscores the central role of GSK-3β in AD pathogenesis to highlight its potential as a multifaceted therapeutic target of an innovative strategy for treating this complex neurodegenerative disease.",Mol Cell Neurosci

We assess the response of the BBB to repeated Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection in rat model of Alzheimer's disease (TgF344-AD), at 13- and 18-months old, using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and filter exchange imaging. Higher BBB water exchange rate is initially detected in infected TgF344-AD rats. BBB water exchange rates correlated with hippocampus aquaporin-4 water channel expression in infected animals. We detected no differences in BBB permeability to gadolinium contrast agent measured by DCE-MRI, confirmed by staining for tight junction proteins, occludin and claudin-5. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of how peripheral inflammation impacts the BBB.",Npj Imaging
40020795,Isoliensinine ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in AlCl<sub>3</sub>/D-gal-induced Alzheimer's disease-like mice by inhibiting the calcium signaling pathway.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The embryos of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine used to treat insomnia, memory decline, and dementia for a long time. However, the underlying material basis and mechanisms of this medicine are still unclear. Isoliensinine (IL) is a major alkaloid derived from lotus embryos. Our previous research has demonstrated that IL can exert strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To reveal the underlying therapeutic effect and mechanism of IL on Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like mice induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub> and D-galactose (D-gal) in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD-like mice were modeled by intragastric injection (i.g.) of AlCl<sub>3</sub> (20 mg/kg/day) and intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of D-gal (120 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Starting from the third week, AD-like mice were treated with IL (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 6 weeks. Cognitive impairment in AD-like mice was evaluated through some behavioral experiments including nest building, open field, novel object recognition, Y maze, and Morris water maze tests. The cortex and hippocampus (DG, CA1, and CA3) regions were analyzed as follows: Neuronal pathological changes and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and silver staining, respectively; The production of Aβ plaques and the activation of microglia and astrocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry; The levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were determined by the ortho-cresolphtalein complexone method. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) were analyzed using the ELISA kits. The expression of CaM, p-CaMKII, Calpain, CDK5, p35/p25, p-Tau, ADAM10, BACE1, PSEN1, APP, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, p-IκBα, and IκBα were evaluated by western blotting.
RESULTS: IL (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) treatment effectively ameliorated cognitive impairment in AD-like model mice. IL inhibited the decrease of brain index and body weight in AD-like mice and alleviated neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampus (DG, CA1, and CA3). IL decreased the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reduce high expression of CaM and Calpain in the cortex and hippocampus of AD-like mice. IL treatment did not affect the expression of CDK5 but inhibited the expression of p-CaMKII and p25/p35, and reduced Tau phosphorylation and NFTs formation. IL also down-regulated the high expression of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and APP and regulated the expression of APP-cleavage secretase (reducing the expression of BACE1 and PSEN1, while increasing the expression of ADAM10), thereby inhibited the production of Aβ plaques in AD-like mouse brain. Moreover, IL inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), and prevented the activation of microglia and astrocytes in AD-like mice.
CONCLUSIONS: IL has a significant therapeutic effect on pathological alterations and cognitive impairment in AlCl<sub>3</sub> and D-gal-induced AD-like mice, indicating that IL may have the potential to treat AD. The anti-AD activity of IL may be associated with its regulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and downstream signaling molecules such as CaM and Calpain.",J Ethnopharmacol
40034543,Regulation of non-emotional memory through α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors activation: A short review.,"The α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors (α<sub>1</sub>-ARs) play a central role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory, but their role in non-emotional memory is still poorly understood. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the functions of α<sub>1</sub>-ARs and highlights their contributions to synaptic efficacy, long-term potentiation (LTP), and long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus and neocortex. There is evidence that α<sub>1</sub>-AR activation occurs through intracellular pathways such as Gq-protein signaling, MAPK, and cAMP cascades. Furthermore, α<sub>1</sub>-ARs are emerging as promising therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to their capability to modulate cognition and neuronal plasticity. New insights into positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that cross the blood-brain barrier provide a potential avenue for safer and more effective therapies. This review highlights the need for further research to improve the understanding of α<sub>1</sub>-ARs and their potential for memory enhancement and neuroprotection.",IBRO Neurosci Rep
40143889,Surface Versus Penetrative rTMS Stimulation May Be More Effective for AD Patients with Cerebrovascular Disease.,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been applied as an investigational therapy for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The recent largest (N = 135) double-blind study with 6 months post-treatment follow-up investigating rTMS efficacy as a treatment for AD found about 72% of participants in each group of active and sham were positively responsive to rTMS (using Magstim AirFilm active and sham coils). Since the used sham coil produced about 25.3% of the peak active stimulus, it was hypothesized it could evoke a measurable response in AD patients. This study looks at the details of the above study's sham responses to determine why and how such a response might occur and how cerebrovascular symptomatology may have impacted that response. In the above-mentioned study, 90 and 45 patients were randomly assigned to active and sham groups, respectively. Those with modified Hachinski Ischemic Scores (HIS) below and above 2 were labeled AD<sub>2</sub> and ADcvd<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Analysis of the primary outcome measure ADAS-Cog score change from baseline to post-treatment and follow-ups showed the ADcvd<sub>2</sub> in the sham group had a significantly (p = .034) greater improvement or less decline at post-treatment and follow-up sessions compared to the ADcvd<sub>2</sub> in the active group. Additionally, the improvement of the ADcvd<sub>2</sub> sham compared to those in the active group persisted longer. Also, there was a significant (p = .036) improvement for AD<sub>2</sub> individuals in the active compared to AD<sub>2</sub> sham stimulation group at 2-months post-treatment. Overall, the sham rTMS stimulus did evoke a measurable response which was more effective for ADcvd<sub>2</sub> in sham than ADcvd<sub>2</sub> in active support of a vascular mechanism likely linked to the shallower sham stimulus penetration.",Neurosci Insights
40149774,Phytochemicals Targeting BDNF Signaling for Treating Neurological Disorders.,"Neurological disorders are defined by a deterioration or disruption of the nervous system's structure and function. These diseases, which include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia, are caused by intricate pathological processes that include excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, genetic mutations, and compromised neurotrophic signaling. Although current pharmaceutical treatments relieve symptoms, their long-term efficacy is limited due to adverse side effects and weak neuroprotective properties. However, when combined with other neuroprotective drugs or adjunct therapy, they may offer additional benefits and improve treatment outcomes. Phytochemicals have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents due to their ability to regulate essential neurotrophic pathways, especially the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade. BDNF is an important target for neurodegenerative disease (ND) treatment since it regulates neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. This review emphasizes the molecular pathways through which various phytochemicals-such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds-stimulate BDNF expression and modulate its downstream signaling pathways, including GSK-3β, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, CREB, and Wnt/β-catenin. This paper also highlights how phytochemical combinations may interact to enhance BDNF activity, offering new therapeutic options for ND treatment. Despite their potential for neuroprotection, phytochemicals face challenges related to pharmacokinetics, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and absorption, highlighting the need for further research into combination therapies and improved formulations. Clinical assessment and mechanistic understanding of BDNF-targeted phytotherapy should be the main goals of future studies. The therapeutic efficacy of natural compounds in regulating neurotrophic signaling is highlighted in this review, providing a viable approach to the prevention and treatment of NDs.",Brain Sci

In the present pilot study, we explored the feasibility and acceptability of using a wearable electroencephalograph (EEG) and a screen-based eye tracker system to identify neural signatures of chronic pain in this population. First, we developed a multimodality biomedical signal acquisition setup with four parts: hardware to record biomedical signals, software to monitor and synchronize multiple inputs, an experimental paradigm with resting state and a cognitive task to assess pain, and an online database to collect subject demographics and subjective measures in a secure environment. EEG signals were recorded using an FDA-cleared 32-channel EEG device with 3-axis accelerometer while gaze and pupil dilation were captured via a head-free, video-based eye tracker. A cognitive task was designed using 32 custom-generated images representing pain/no-pain conditions in addition to 16 images with painful and neuter expressions from the Delaware Pain Database. EEGs, accelerometer, and eye tracker data were synchronized with the behavioral paradigm by sending digital triggers from paradigm module on a MATLAB/Simulink model that was designed for the study. Finally, a database was created on RedCap with 16 separate instruments from cognitive and pain assessment tools to the feasibility and acceptability surveys.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40043550,A cognitive-motor framework for spatial navigation in aging and early-stage Alzheimer's disease.,"Spatial navigation is essential for wellbeing and independence and shows significant declines as part of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Navigation is also one of the earliest behaviors impacted by this devastating disease. Neurobiological models of aging and spatial navigation have focused primarily on the cognitive factors that account for impaired navigation abilities during the course of healthy aging and early stages of preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. The contributions of physical factors that are essential to planning and executing movements during successful navigation, such as gait and dynamic balance, are often overlooked despite also being vulnerable to early stages of neurodegenerative disease. We review emerging evidence that spatial navigation and functional mobility each draw on highly overlapping sensory systems, cognitive processes, and brain structures that are susceptible to healthy and pathological aging processes. Based on this evidence, we provide an alternative to models that have focused primarily on spatial navigation as a higher order cognitive function dependent on brain areas such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Instead, we argue that spatial navigation may offer an ecologically valid cognitive-motor phenotype of age-related cognitive dysfunction. We propose that dual cognitive-motor deficits in spatial navigation may arise from early changes in neuromodulatory and peripheral sensory systems that precede changes in regions such as the entorhinal cortex.",Cortex
40003632,Molecular Dynamics of Apolipoprotein Genotypes APOE4 and SNARE Family Proteins and Their Impact on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and a significant impact on quality of life. The APOE ε4 allele is a major genetic contributor to AD pathogenesis, with synaptic dysfunction being a central hallmark in its pathophysiology. While the role of APOE4 in reducing SNARE protein levels has been established, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this interaction remain obscure. Our research employs molecular dynamics simulations to analyze interactions between APOE4 and APOE3 isoforms and the synaptic proteins VAMP2, SNAP25, and SYNTAXIN1, which play crucial roles in the presynaptic membrane. Our findings reveal that APOE4 significantly destabilizes the SNARE complex, suppresses its structural dynamics, and reduces hydrogen bonding, consequently partially hindering neurotransmitter release-a very likely discovery for elucidating synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. We identified that APOE4 exhibits a diminished affinity for the SNARE complex in comparison to APOE3. This observation suggests that APOE4 may play a role in modulating the stability of the SNARE complex, potentially impacting the progression and occurrence of Alzheimer's disease through free energy analysis. This work highlights the perturbations in synaptic function mediated by APOE4, which may offer novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of AD. By elucidating the molecular interplay between APOE4 and the SNARE complex, our study not only enhances our comprehension of AD's synaptic pathology but also paves the way for devising innovative therapeutic interventions, such as targeting the APOE4-SNARE complex interaction or to restore neurotransmitter release.",Life (Basel)
40136454,Gene Co-Expression Analysis Reveals Functional Differences Between Early- and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly among older adults, has driven increased research into its underlying mechanisms and risk factors. Aging, genetic susceptibility, and cardiovascular health are recognized contributors to AD, but how the age of onset affects disease progression remains underexplored. This study investigates the role of early- versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD, respectively) in shaping the trajectory of cognitive decline. Leveraging data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), two cohorts were established: individuals with early-onset AD and those with late-onset AD. Comprehensive analyses, including differential gene expression profiling, pathway enrichment, and gene co-expression network construction, were conducted to identify distinct molecular signatures associated with each cohort. Network modularity learning algorithms were used to discern the inner structure of co-expression networks and their related functional features. Computed network descriptors provided deeper insights into the influence of age at onset on the biological progression of AD.",Curr Issues Mol Biol
40079621,In Situ Labeling of Pathogenic Tau Using Photo-Affinity Chemical Probes.,"Tau aggregation plays a crucial role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Developing specific techniques that can isolate pathogenic tau from brain tissue is important for understanding tauopathies and advancing targeted therapies. Here, we develop photoaffinity small molecular probes and a novel method for in situ tissue labeling and investigate their activity in interacting with tau in cells and AD patient brains. Based on the reported chemical structures of tau PET tracers, we designed and synthesized two tau-specific probes, namely, Tau-2 and Tau-4. After validation in cell, mouse model, and patient brain samples, our photolabeling results suggested that Tau-2 effectively labels soluble tau in cell and mouse models, while Tau-4 selectively binds high-molecular-weight tau aggregates in late-stage AD patient brain tissues. Proteomic analysis verified the specific isolation of pathogenic tau from AD brain samples. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of our photoaffinity probes as powerful tools for investigating tau proteins and neurofibrillary tangles in neurodegenerative diseases.",ACS Chem Biol
40163129,IL-17 A Exacerbated Neuroinflammatory and Neurodegenerative Biomarkers in Intranasal Amyloid-Beta Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-17 A (IL-17 A) have been found to be significantly associated with AD patients. IL-17 A amplifies neuroinflammation during AD pathology. This study highlighted the ability of IL-17 A to exacerbate amyloid-beta-induced pathology in animals. The AD pathology was induced with repeated intranasal administration of Aβ along with recombinant mouse IL-17 A (rmIL-17) at 1, 2 and 4 µg/kg for seven alternate days. Although, the combination of rmIL-17 and Aβ did not have severe effects on memory of the animals, but it drastically increased the IL-17 A mediated signaling, level of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants in the hippocampus and cortex regions of the animal brains. Interestingly, combining rmIL-17 with Aβ also triggered the expression of AD structural markers like pTau, amyloid-beta and BACE1 in the brain regions. Furthermore, rmIL-17 with Aβ exposure stimulated astrocytes and microglia leading to activation of proinflammatory signaling in the brain of the animals. These results showed the propensity of IL-17 A to promote severity of AD pathology and suggest IL-17 A as potent therapeutic target to control AD progression.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol
40149738,Downregulation of Parahippocampal Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Proper regulation of copper is essential for maintaining neuronal stability and is facilitated by several chaperone proteins, protecting cells from oxidative damage that would otherwise be caused by improperly regulated copper ions. Oxidative stress, resulting from such dysregulation, is hypothesized to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the concentrations of the copper chaperones CCS, DCTN4, and ATOX1 in control and AD cases via Western blotting and ELISA, and quantified the copper concentrations in fractionated neurons using ICP-MS.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal a significant reduction in CCS levels in AD cases (p = 0.0085), with a progressive decline observed with advancing age. This decline was more pronounced in women, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0768). No significant differences were observed in copper concentrations within synaptosomal (p = 0.3869) or cytosolic fractions (p = 0.4461) between the AD and control cases. Additionally, comprehensive analyses of the effects of sex and age showed no significant impact on the levels of copper chaperones or copper distribution across cellular compartments.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a strong association between reduced CCS levels and AD pathology, highlighting a potential role for CCS in the redistribution of copper ions within neurons. This redistribution may contribute to oxidative stress and neuronal dysfunction, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis.",Brain Sci
39983634,Loneliness and cognitive function in older adults living in Latin America: A systematic review.,"English language systematic reviews with samples from high-income countries have found an inverse relationship between loneliness and cognitive function. Considering that cultural and contextual resources influence the experience of loneliness and cognitive health, we conducted a systematic review analyzing quantitative studies exploring the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function in older adults in Latin America. Following PRISMA guidelines, we used five databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, LILACS, and SciELO). Inclusion criteria were: a) quantitative research examining the relationship between loneliness and cognitive health, b) descriptions of loneliness and measures of cognitive function, c) English or Spanish language peer-reviewed articles, and d) a sample of older adults in Latin America (≥60 years). We assessed bias using the Risk of Bias Instrument for Cross-Sectional Surveys of Attitudes and Practices. Seven of the 1,887 studies (all cross-sectional) met the inclusion criteria, comprising 26,440 participants from Brazil or Mexico. Most, but not all, found a significant inverse association between loneliness and cognitive function after controlling for salient health and psychosocial factors. Measures and conceptualizations of loneliness and cognitive function, as well as theoretical explanations linking these concepts, varied. Two studies had a high risk of bias. Current evidence suggests a possible cross-sectional association between loneliness and cognitive function in older adults in these countries. Further research is needed to examine the possible bidirectional relationship using representative samples and longitudinal designs; test pathways linking dimensions of loneliness (e.g., chronicity) to cognitive function (e.g., Alzheimer's disease continuum), and explore Latin American diversity (e.g., countries, indigenous peoples, sexual minorities).",Arch Med Res
40123371,Improving executive functioning and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease with music therapy: A narrative review of potential neural mechanisms.,"The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the concurrent cost of healthcare will increase as the population continues to age. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively manage symptoms of AD but carry side effects and ineffectively address underlying causes and disease prevention. Non-pharmaceutical interventions for AD, such as music training and therapy do not carry these side effects and can improve symptoms, and should therefore be explored as stand-alone or co-therapy for AD. In addition, music encapsulates modifiable lifestyle factors, such as cognitive stimulation, that have been shown to delay progression of and prevent AD. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning how music improves AD symptoms are not fully understood and whether music can target compensatory processes, activate neural networks, or even slow or prevent AD needs further research. Research suggests neural mechanism may involve stimulating brain areas to promote neurogenesis, dopaminergic rewards systems, and the default mode network (DMN). Alternatively, this review proposes that music improve symptoms of AD via the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN), the salience network (SN) and DMN, and neural compensation. This review will then present evidence for how music could activate the FPCN, SN, and DMN to improve their efficiency, organization, and cognitive functions they govern, protecting the brain from damage, slowing progression, and possibly preventing AD. Establishing how music improves symptoms of AD can lead to tailored music therapy protocols that target functional neural networks responsible for impaired executive functions common in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40118053,Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identification of biomarkers for amyloid and tau PET stages.,"Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials.",Cell Rep Med
40151623,Sleep architecture in Alzheimer's disease continuum: The deep sleep question.,"As sleep appears to be closely related to cognitive status, we aimed to explore the association between the percentage of deep sleep, cognitive state, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker amyloid-beta 42 in non-demented individuals. In this cross-sectional study, 90 non-demented participants from the Aiginition Longitudinal Biomarker Investigation of Neurodegeneration cohort underwent a one-night WatchPAT sleep evaluation. Participants were categorized by cognitive status (patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or cognitively normal [CN] individuals) and CSF Aβ42 status (Aβ42 ≤ 1,030 pg/mL [A+] or Ab42 &gt; 1,030 pg/mL [A-]). After controlling for age, sex, and years of education, a significant inverse association was found between the percentage of deep sleep and the odds of being classified as MCI compared to CN (OR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.76-0.97], p = 0.012). However, a non-significant trend for an inverse association between the percentage of deep sleep and the odds of being classified as A+ was observed (OR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.84-1.01], p = 0.092). This study demonstrates a significant link between deep sleep and MCI. Although more longitudinal studies are needed, deep sleep could potentially serve as a novel biomarker of cognitive decline and an intervention target for dementia prevention.",Open Life Sci
40072379,"Disease Burden, Temporal Trends, and Cross-Country Inequality Associated with Sociodemographic Indicators in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias.","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this article is to describe the global burden and temporal trends of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias from 1990 to 2021 and explore cross-country inequality associated with sociodemographic development-related factors.
METHODS: The disability-adjusted life years of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and sociodemographic index were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, and other sociodemographic development-related factors, including government expenditure on education (% of GDP), net national income per capita, health expenditure per capita, and fertility rate, were sourced from World Bank Data. Disability-adjusted life years of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias across 204 countries/territories and global age-sex distribution in 2021 were illustrated. The Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the temporal trends of disease burden, and the slope index of inequality and concentration index were calculated to quantify cross-country inequalities. Analyses were conducted in 2024.
RESULTS: Significant disparities were observed in the numbers, rates, and age-standardized rates of disability-adjusted life years across 204 countries/territories. Females demonstrated higher disability-adjusted life year numbers (rates) for all age groups. Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate increased worldwide and was high in high-middle and middle sociodemographic index regions but increased faster in low (average annual percentage change=0.227%) and low-middle (average annual percentage change=0.244%) sociodemographic index regions. Cross-country inequality analyses indicated that disability-adjusted life years of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were skewed and higher in countries with higher sociodemographic development, and the inequality increased with time except for education expenditure-related inequality.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has risen globally over the past 3 decades, accompanied by increasing cross-country inequalities, which disproportionately affects countries with high sociodemographic development. Boosting expenditure on education may narrow this inequality.",Am J Prev Med
40145080,AD-Diff: enhancing Alzheimer's disease prediction accuracy through multimodal fusion.,"Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial to improving patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. However, current predictive methods face challenges such as insufficient multimodal information integration and the high cost of PET image acquisition, which limit their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative model, AD-Diff. This model significantly improves AD prediction accuracy by integrating PET images generated through a diffusion process with cognitive scale data and other modalities. Specifically, the AD-Diff model consists of two core components: the ADdiffusion module and the multimodal Mamba Classifier. The ADdiffusion module uses a 3D diffusion process to generate high-quality PET images, which are then fused with MRI images and tabular data to provide input for the Multimodal Mamba Classifier. Experimental results on the OASIS and ADNI datasets demonstrate that the AD-Diff model performs exceptionally well in both long-term and short-term AD prediction tasks, significantly improving prediction accuracy and reliability. These results highlight the significant advantages of the AD-Diff model in handling complex medical image data and multimodal information, providing an effective tool for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Front Comput Neurosci
40012182,Sample size determination for a study with variable follow-up time.,"For a study to detect the outcome change at the follow-up visit from baseline, the pre-test and post-test design is commonly used to assess the treatment-control difference. Several existing methods were developed for sample size calculation including the subtraction method, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and linear mixed model. The first two methods can be used when the follow-up time is the same as scheduled. Although the linear mixed model can analyze the repeated measures by including the actual visit time to account for the variability of the follow-up time, it often assumes a constant treatment-control difference at any follow-up time which may not be correct in practice. We propose to develop a new statistical model to compare the treatment-control difference at the planned follow-up time while controlling for the follow-up time variation. The spline functions are used to estimate the trajectories of the treatment arm and the control arm. We compared the performance of these methods with regards to type I error rate, statistical power, and sample size under various conditions. These four methods all control for the type I error rate. The new method and the ANCOVA method are often more powerful than the other two methods, and they have similar statistical power when a linear disease progression is satisfied. For a study with non-linear disease progression, the new method can be more powerful than the ANCOVA method. We used data from a completed Alzheimer's disease trial to illustrate the application of the proposed method.",J Biopharm Stat
40138942,BOLD amplitude correlates of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical stage during which molecular markers of amyloid beta and tau pathology rise, but there is minimal neurodegeneration or cognitive decline. Previous literature suggests that measures of brain function might be more sensitive to neuropathologic burden during the preclinical stage of AD than conventional measures of macrostructure, such as cortical thickness. Among studies that used resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions with Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast, most employed connectivity-based analytic approaches. Consequently, little is known about the effects of amyloid and tau pathology on amplitude of intrinsic BOLD signal fluctuations. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the effects of preclinical and prodromal AD on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the BOLD signal both at the whole-brain level and at a more granular level focused on subregions of the medial temporal lobe. We observed reduced ALFF in both preclinical and prodromal AD. In preclinical AD, amyloid positivity was associated with a spatially diffuse ALFF reduction in the frontal, medial parietal, and lateral temporal association cortices. In contrast, tau pathology was negatively associated with ALFF in the entorhinal cortex. These ALFF effects were observed in the absence of observable macrostructural changes in preclinical AD and remained after adjusting for structural atrophy in prodromal AD, indicating that ALFF offers additional sensitivity to early disease processes beyond what is provided by traditional structural imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. We conclude that ALFF may be a promising imaging-based biomarker in preclinical AD.",Neurobiol Aging
40049315,TREM2 promotes hippocampal neurogenesis through regulating microglial M2 polarization in APP/PS1 mice.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) mainly expressed on microglia in the brain, and its mutations can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Upregulation or activation of TREM2 has been found to ameliorate several pathological features of AD, such as the reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, the effects of TREM2 on neurogenesis are little understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of TREM2 on hippocampal neurogenesis associated with microglial M2 polarization in APP/PS1 mice. Lentivirus vectors were used to interfere with the expression of TREM2 on microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and BV2 cells. The supernatant was collected from BV2 cells as a conditioned medium (CM) to culture neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. Upregulation of TREM2 partially salvaged the proliferation of NSCs and the decrease of the number of immature/mature neurons in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which was accompanied by an improvement in cognitive ability. Furthermore, upregulation of TREM2 increased the M2 microglia marker CD206, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and anti-inflammatory factors, while decreased the M1 microglia markers CD16/32 and CD86 and pro-inflammatory factors in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, the upregulation of TREM2 also led to a significant increase in the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt. In vitro, treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, abolished the beneficial effects of TREM2 on shifting microglia from M1 to M2 and the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Taken together, these findings indicated that upregulation of TREM2 activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to promote microglial M2 polarization and led to the secretion of more BDNF, accompanied by an improved hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. Thus, TREM2 might be a promising target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.",Exp Neurol
40149001,Decoding microglial immunometabolism: a new frontier in Alzheimer's disease research.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a dynamic interaction between neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation, where microglia play a central role. These immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in response to AD-related pathology, with key genes such as TREM2, APOE, and HIF-1α orchestrating these processes. Microglial metabolism adapts to environmental stimuli, shifting between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Hexokinase-2 facilitates glycolytic flux, while AMPK acts as an energy sensor, coordinating lipid and glucose metabolism. TREM2 and APOE regulate microglial lipid homeostasis, influencing Aβ clearance and immune responses. LPL and ABCA7, both associated with AD risk, modulate lipid processing and cholesterol transport, linking lipid metabolism to neurodegeneration. PPARG further supports lipid metabolism by regulating microglial inflammatory responses. Amino acid metabolism also contributes to microglial function. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase controls the kynurenine pathway, producing neurotoxic metabolites linked to AD pathology. Additionally, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase regulates the pentose phosphate pathway, maintaining redox balance and immune activation. Dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, influenced by genetic variants such as APOE4, impair microglial responses and exacerbate AD progression. Recent findings highlight the interplay between metabolic regulators like REV-ERBα, which modulates lipid metabolism and inflammation, and Syk, which influences immune responses and Aβ clearance. These insights offer promising therapeutic targets, including strategies aimed at HIF-1α modulation, which could restore microglial function depending on disease stage. By integrating metabolic, immune, and genetic factors, this review underscores the importance of microglial immunometabolism in AD. Targeting key metabolic pathways could provide novel therapeutic strategies for mitigating neuroinflammation and restoring microglial function, ultimately paving the way for innovative treatments in neurodegenerative diseases.",Mol Neurodegener
40065917,Broad repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus in Alzheimer's disease: A rationale and study design.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process.
METHODS: We will conduct a two-stage trial of large-coil rTMS targeting the precuneus (a key hub in the DMN affected by AD) in 54 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome focused primarily on determining tolerability and feasibility and secondarily focused on determining short-term efficacy for memory. The first stage will involve 5 to 10 participants receiving open-label active treatment to refine the protocol. The following second stage will consist of a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to study feasibility and tolerability while exploring target engagement and short-term efficacy for memory. Participants will undergo 16 total rTMS brain stimulation sessions over the course of 5 weeks. A full course of open-label active treatment will be offered as an extension to the sham group after unblinding. Outcomes will focus on completion rates and adverse events to demonstrate feasibility and tolerability. Further exploratory outcomes will include neuropsychological assessments, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers to demonstrate the feasibility of collection and explore preliminary changes in these measures.
RESULTS: We anticipate this treatment is feasible and tolerable and may show evidence of target engagement and clinical improvement.
DISCUSSION: Should we achieve expected positive outcomes in feasibility and tolerability, this will justify future work focusing on clear demonstrations of clinical efficacy and biomarker engagement, as well as enhancement of generalizability and scalability.
HIGHLIGHTS: Induction-to-maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though recent methods require intensive personalization.We propose here a trial design of precuneus rTMS in mild-to-early-moderate AD dementia using exclusively off-the-shelf equipment and protocol modifications to reduce participant burden.Our two novel modifications from prior work are (1) using a larger rTMS coil, and (2) consolidating the induction phase of treatment.This trial focuses primarily on tolerability and feasibility while exploring clinical measures of efficacy and biomarkers of target engagement.Our trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06597942.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40014253,"Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of baicalein: targeting Nrf2, and NFĸB in neurodegenerative disease.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the brain regions, including the hippocampus, cortex, substantia nigra, and striatum. Multiple pathological mechanisms drive this neuronal loss, including oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, and excitotoxicity. Recent evidence suggests that these processes are intricately linked to the dysregulation of key signalling pathways, such as the IĸB/NFĸB, and KEAP1/Nrf2 pathways, which play central roles in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial functions, respectively. At present, no cure exists for neurodegenerative disorders, and available medications focus solely on symptomatic management. While these treatments provide temporary relief, their long-term use is often associated with adverse health effects. In this context, natural Phytoactive constituents like Baicalein, a bioactive flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, have gained attention for their promising therapeutic potential. Baicalein has been shown to modulate the IĸB/NFĸB, and KEAP1/Nrf2 pathways, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress while supporting mitochondrial health. It exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NFĸB activation, thereby reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NLRP3 inflammasome, and enzymes like COX-2, LOX, and iNOS, which are essential for innate and adaptive immune responses. Simultaneously, baicalein enhances the Nrf2 activation, promoting the expression of antioxidant enzymes like HO-1, NQO1, GPx, and SOD, thus countering oxidative stress. These findings highlight the potential of baiclalein as a complementary approach for managing neurodegenerative diseases, offering a safer and more holistic alternative to conventional therapies.",Inflammopharmacology

Analyses were performed on serial 5 μm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human brain sections acquired from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. Visual assessment of colocalization with IHC as well as quantitative analyses were used. Evaluation of the tracers' off-target binding profiles were performed. Both tracers had similar binding properties for tau aggregates with preference to middling tangle maturity as shown by comparison to immunohistochemical distributions. Both the tracers showed strong binding to AD tau aggregates and no or minimal binding to non-AD tauopathies which corroborates with other studies.",Acta Neuropathol

In this study, we present a novel AI-based automated framework to process and evaluate MWM test videos, aiming to enhance behavioral analysis through machine learning. Our pipeline involves video preprocessing, animal detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trajectory tracking, and postprocessing to derive detailed behavioral features. We propose concentric circle segmentation of the pool next to the quadrant-based division, and we extract 32 behavioral metrics for each zone, which are employed in classification tasks to differentiate between younger and older animals. Several machine learning classifiers, including random forest and neural networks, are evaluated, with feature selection techniques applied to improve the classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in classification performance, particularly through the integration of feature sets derived from concentric zone analyses. This automated approach offers a robust solution for MWM data processing, providing enhanced precision and reliability, which is critical for the study of neurodegenerative disorders.",Sensors (Basel)
40046733,Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Progression to Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is a condition that impairs cognition, memory, and behavior. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage before AD, urgently needs the development of prediction models for conversion from MCI to AD.
METHOD: This study used machine learning methods to predict whether MCI subjects would develop AD, highlighting the importance of biomarkers (biological indicators from neuroimaging, such as MRI and PET scans, and molecular assays from cerebrospinal fluid or blood) and non-biomarker features in AD research and clinical practice. These indicators aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and the development of potential treatments for MCI subjects. Using baseline data, which includes measurements of different biomarkers, we predicted disease progression at the patient's last visit. The Shapley value explanation (SHAP) technique was used to identify key features for predicting patient progression.
RESULTS: The study used the ADNI database to evaluate the effectiveness of eight classification methods for predicting progression from MCI to AD. Four fundamental data sampling approaches were compared to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting. The SHAP technique improved the ability to identify biomarkers and non-biomarker features, enhancing the prediction of disease progression. NEAR-MISS was found to be the most advantageous sampling method, while XGBoost was found to be the superior classification method, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive power.
CONCLUSION: The proposed SHAP for feature selection combined with XGBoost may provide improved predictive accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's patients.",J Med Biol Eng

39979885,"Burden of neurological diseases in Asia, from 1990 to 2021 and its predicted level to 2045: a Global Burden of Disease study.","INTRODUCTION: Neurological diseases are a significant contributor to premature mortality and temporary or long-term disability among survivors. Asia serves as an essential region for assessing the shifting burden of these disorders. This study aims to calculate and evaluate the changes in burden of neurological diseases across Asia.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease database provided data on deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), incidence, and prevalence from 1990 to 2021 across Asian subregions and countries. Twelve common neurological diseases were analyzed. Estimated Annual Percent Change were calculated to reveal trends in all the metrics. The Nordpred age-period-cohort model was employed to project the neurological disease burden.
RESULTS: In 2021, the leading neurological disorders in DALYs were stroke (109,144.87, 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 95,992.89-123,089.90), headache disorders (25,713.91, 95%UI 4,693.65-54,853.47), and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (19,156.46, 95% UI 9,137.72-41,421.18). Stroke and degenerative neurological disorder presented the most severe burden in East Asia, while headache disorders were prominent in South Asia. Between 1990 and 2021, Asia's regions showed varying reductions in age-standardized DALYs and age-standardized death rates for neurological diseases, with the steepest decline observed in high-income Asia Pacific (DALYs -2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.4 to -2.13; ASDR -3.85, 95% CI -4.02 to -3.69). Neurological disease burden was higher in males, peaking at ages 65-74. Projections to 2045 indicate a decline in DALYs for stroke, infectious neurological diseases, Parkinson's disease, and idiopathic epilepsy across most regions of Asia. In contrast, trends for other neurological diseases will vary regionally.
CONCLUSION: Neurological diseases were the primary cause of DALYs in 2021, ranking second only to cardiovascular diseases as a leading cause of death. As the aging trend in Asia's population continues to intensify, it is crucial to focus more on the prevention and management of neurological disorders.",BMC Public Health
40083942,The inter-organelle cross-talk finely orchestrated in the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein in dendritic arborization neurons of Drosophila.,"Background: Organelles in neuronal dendrites facilitate local metabolic processes and energy supply, crucial for dendrite development and neurodegenerative diseases. The distinct functions of dendritic organelles have been well studied, however, their crosstalk under physiological and pathological contexts remains elusive. We aimed to establish an in vivo model system of contacts between multi-organelles for investigating the modulation of inter-organelle crosstalk in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: A dendrite model of organelle contacts was developed in Drosophila neurons using a set of proximity-driven probes and four-color Airyscan super-resolution imaging. The systematic modulations among multiple contact sites (CSs) between organelles were examined by manipulating CS tethers and vesicular transporters. Finally, perturbations of these CSs and the dendrite structure in the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) were evaluated by introducing three stages of the processing in this model system. Results: A dynamic network, interconnected via CSs and organized with multi-organelle contacts, was presented among Golgi outposts, the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria (GELM). The CS modulations were found to encompass both their density and motility. Notably, multi-CSs participated in complementary modulations spanning across different cellular pathways. Furthermore, the CS network was revealed to be progressively disturbed in APP amyloidogenic processing, with upregulations in density and motility extending from single- to multi-CSs. These CS perturbations, along with defects in dendrite structural plasticity, could be partially rescued by knocking down Miro. Conclusion: The elucidation of CS modulation modes in the GELM network model reveals a cascaded dysregulation of organelle crosstalk during APP amyloidogenic processing. It expands the mechanisms of inter-organelle communication and provides novel insights into neurodegeneration in AD pathology.",Theranostics

His physicians believed that the subsequent dementia was related to the infection. After death at 24 years of age, postmortem brain examination revealed abundant AD-type senile plaques and fibrils, formally confirming AD. Other potential causes of early-onset dementia are discussed, but these are distinct from patient E.H.

40020422,Interpretable modality-specific and interactive graph convolutional network on brain functional and structural connectomes.,"Both brain functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) provide distinct neural mechanisms for cognition and neurological disease. In addition, interactions between SC and FC within distributed association regions are related to alterations in cognition or neurological diseases, considering the inherent linkage between neural function and structure. However, there is a scarcity of existing learning-based methods that leverage both modality-specific characteristics and high-order interactions between the two modalities for regression or classification. Hence, this study proposes an interpretable modality-specific and interactive graph convolutional network (MS-Inter-GCN) that incorporates modality-specific information, reflecting the unique neural mechanism for each modality, and structure-function interactions, capturing the underlying foundation provided by white-matter fiber tracts for high-level brain function. In MS-Inter-GCN, we generate modality-specific task-relevant embeddings separately from both FC and SC using a graph convolutional encoder-decoder module. Subsequently, we learn the interactive weights between corresponding regions of FC and SC, reflecting the coupling strength, by employing an interactive module on the embeddings of both modalities. A novel graph structure is constructed, which uses modality-specific task-relevant embeddings and inserts the interactive weights as edges connecting corresponding regions of two modalities, and then is used for the regression or classification task. Finally, a post-hoc explainable technology - GNNExplainer- is used to identify salient regions and connections of each modality as well as salient interactions between FC and SC associated with tasks. We apply the proposed framework to fluid cognition prediction, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and schizophrenia (SZ) classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the other ten state-of-the-art methods on multi-modal brain features on all tasks. The GNNExplainer identifies salient structural and functional regions and connections for fluid cognition, PD, AD, and SZ. It confirms that strong structure-function coupling within the executive and control networks, combined with weak coupling within the motor network, is associated with fluid cognition. Moreover, structure-function decoupling in specific brain regions serves as a marker for different diseases: decoupling of the prefrontal, superior parietal, and superior occipital cortices is a marker of PD; decoupling of the middle frontal and lateral parietal cortices, temporal pole, and subcortical regions is indicative of AD; and decoupling of the prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, as well as the cerebellum, contributes to SZ.",Med Image Anal
40058463,Hippocampal sclerosis: A review on current research status and its mechanisms.,"Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a pathological condition characterized by significant loss of hippocampal neurons and gliosis. This condition represents the most common neuropathological change observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and is also found in aging individuals. TLE related to HS is the most prevalent type of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, and its underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Therefore, developing improved methods for predicting and treating drug-resistant patients with TLE-HS is crucial. Patients with TLE-HS often experience cognitive impairment and psychological comorbidities, significantly affecting their quality of life. Consequently, a thorough review of the current research status of TLE-HS is essential, focusing on its prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and underlying mechanisms. The hippocampus plays a pivotal role in memory and cognition. HS of aging (HS-Aging), a condition linked to dementia in the ultra-elderly, is marked by severe CA1 (cornu ammonis) neuronal loss and frequent transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, clinical characteristics and patterns of hippocampal atrophy can help differentiate between the two disorders. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathological features of HS, the relevant mechanisms underlying TLE-HS and HS-Aging, current imaging diagnostic techniques, including machine learning, and available treatment modalities. It also explores the prognosis and comorbidities related to these conditions. Future research directions include establishing animal models to clarify the poorly understood mechanisms underlying HS, particularly those related to emotional processing. Investigating post-HS behavioral and cognitive changes in these models will lay the foundation for further advancements in this field. This review is a cornerstone for future investigations and suggests additional research endeavors.",Ageing Res Rev
40055296,Impact of amygdala functional connectivity on cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.,"The functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its relationship to cognitive impairment is still not well established. Thus, we examined resting-state FC changes in the amygdala among 21 patients with AD dementia (ADD) and 34 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), compared to 33 individuals with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), to provide insights into the association between amygdala FC and cognitive decline in different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted seed-to-voxel FC analysis, focused on two cognitive functions, episodic memory, and face recognition, and examined the correlations between changes in FC of the amygdala and cognitive test scores. We demonstrated that the left amygdala exhibits progressive disruption in FC, especially with the frontal regions in aMCI and ADD. We further identified that this disrupted FC in the left amygdala showed significant positive correlations with cognitive test scores from the MCI stage onward. Our results indicate that FC changes in the left amygdala may serve as an early marker of AD and this FC pattern of amygdala influence detrimentally affects episodic memory and face recognition functions. These findings highlight that the amygdala may be a critical anatomical region for detecting the early stages of AD.",Neurol Sci
39994963,"Dance-like state detection, curiosity, and decentering: A pilot study on artful movement and mindfulness.","BACKGROUND: Curiosity and decentering are two constructs that represent momentary mindfulness. Dance is an art and complex physical activity mode, which may serve as a behavioral correlate of mindfulness.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize momentary mindfulness in relation to a novel, accelerometer-derived measure for characterizing human movement quality (i.e. ""dance-like state"" DLS scores).
METHODS: Adults (N = 41), ages 18-83 years old, engaged in the following conditions in a lab and completed questionnaires on mindfulness after each: (1) clipping their fingernails; (2) sitting, standing, and walking on a treadmill; and (3) dancing at self-determined reference intensities with and without music. Conditions 2-3 were monitored with accelerometers. DLS score summary statistics (i.e. median and median amplitude deviation [MAD]) were used in linear mixed effects models.
RESULTS: On average, curiosity [13.7(1.02)] was significantly associated with median DLS scores (β = 1.79, p = 0.007) over time; adults with a lower median DLS score reported higher levels of curiosity [16.2; 95%C.I. 13.3-19.0], on average, when compared [12.6; 95%C.I., 10.3-14.9] to adults with a higher median DLS score. On average, decentering [14.9(1.01)] was significantly associated with the DLS score MAD (β = 1.28, p = 0.035) over time; adults who had less variability in DLS scores across conditions reported greater experiences of decentering [15.9; 95%C.I. 13.7-18.1], on average, when compared [13.3; 95%C.I. 10.7-15.9] to adults with more variability in DLS scores across conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Among ostensibly healthy adults, movement quality was correlated with momentary mindfulness. Additional research is needed to understand if DLS scores are differentially associated with momentary mindfulness among adults with Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis
40140924,Diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau217 in a memory clinic cohort using the Lumipulse automated platform.,"BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a promising tool for accessible and accurate biological diagnostics. However, data in clinical practice are needed to better understand their diagnostic and prognostic ability in memory unit patients.
METHODS: We analyzed plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) and neuroflament light chain (NfL) levels and AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a group of 493 subjects using the Lumipulse G600II platform. The sample includes 340 patients from our memory unit (142 dementia, 186 mild cognitive impairment, and 12 with subjective complaints) and 153 cognitively unimpaired volunteers. We have correlated plasma and CSF biomarkers; we have analyzed plasma biomarker levels as a function of clinical diagnosis, cognitive status and amyloid status. We have also studied the ability of p-tau217 to discriminate between amyloid-positive and -negative subjects according to CSF using receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 correlated significantly with CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 (Rho = -0.75; p-value < 0.001), p-tau181 (r = 0.66; p-value < 0.001), and t-tau (r = 0.59; p-value < 0.001). Plasma NfL correlated with CSF NfL (r = 0.48; p-value < 0.001). By clinical diagnosis, plasma p-tau217 levels showed to be higher in AD patients than in healthy controls (difference = 0.63 pg/ml; p-value < 0.001), FTD (difference = 0.60 pg/ml; p-value < 0.001), and nondegenerative dementias (difference = 0.61 pg/ml; p-value < 0.001). Plasma p-tau217 showed an area under the curve of 0.95 to discriminate between A + and A- subjects (95%CI 0.93-0.97).
CONCLUSION: Plasma p-tau217 shows excellent results for detecting amyloid pathology at brain level in a clinical setting with an AUC of 0.95. It is a highly specific marker of AD and increases progressively along the disease continuum. Using plasma p-tau217 as an initial diagnostic tool with cut-offs at sensitivities and specificities of 95 or 97.5% could save between 57.4-84.8% of LP/PETs with diagnostic accuracies of 95-97%.

40075093,Administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis in pregnant mice enhances glycolysis and histone lactylation/ADAM17 leading to cleft palate in offspring.,"Periodontal disease is a risk factor for many systemic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Cleft palate (CP), the most common congenital craniofacial defect, has a multifaceted etiology influenced by complex genetic and environmental risk factors such as maternal bacterial or virus infection. A prior case-control study revealed a surprisingly strong association between maternal periodontal disease and CP in offspring. However, the precise relationship remains unclear. In this study, the relationship between maternal oral pathogen and CP in offspring was studied by sonicated P. gingivalis injected intravenously and orally into pregnant mice. We investigated an obvious increasing CP (12.5%) in sonicated P. gingivalis group which had inhibited osteogenesis in mesenchyme and blocked efferocytosis in epithelium. Then glycolysis and H4K12 lactylation (H4K12la) were detected to elevate in both mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells and macrophages under P. gingivalis exposure which further promoted the transcription of metallopeptidase domain17 (ADAM17), subsequently mediated the shedding of transforming growth factor-beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) in MEPM cells and mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in macrophages and resulted in the suppression of efferocytosis and osteogenesis in palate, eventually caused abnormalities in palate fusion and ossification. The abnormal efferocytosis also led to a predominance of M1 macrophages, which indirectly inhibited palatal osteogenesis via extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, pharmacological ADAM17 inhibition could ameliorate the abnormality of P. gingivalis-induced abnormal palate development. Therefore, our study extends the knowledge of how maternal oral pathogen affects fetal palate development and provides a novel perspective to understand the pathogenesis of CP.",Int J Oral Sci
39988698,"TDP43 is a newly identified substrate for PS1, enhancing the expression of APP following cleavage.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been comprehensively studied; however, most research has focused on Aβ plaque deposition and Tau protein phosphorylation. Emerging evidence suggests that TDP43 may be significantly involved AD and potentially worsening its pathology. To investigate the role of TDP43 in the pathological development of AD, we employed the STRING protein network interaction tool to identify potential relationships between TDP43 and other proteins, including PS1 and APP. Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted, and the results indicated that TDP43 could interact with PS1. Further studies have shown that the interaction between the two would also lead to the loss of nuclear localization of TDP43. We also found that overexpression or knockdown of PS1 in both primary cells, HeLa and NSC34 cells indicated that TDP43 is likely to be a substrate of PS1. Subsequent use of the L685,458 and z-VAD, the PS1 mutant plasmids D257A and D385A, and bioinformatics approaches demonstrated that PS1 is dependent on γ-secretase and caspase activity to cleave TDP43, and that the cleavage site is at amino acid 315 of TDP43. Besides, our study demonstrated that the interaction of TDP43 with PS1 in primary cells, HeLa and NSC34 cells can promote APP expression, resulting in elevated Aβ levels. Finally, we investigated whether the interaction between TDP43 and PS1 affects the expression of other PS1 substrates, Notch and E-cadherin. Our results demonstrated that TDP43 cleaved by PS1 only promoted APP expression and had no effect on other PS1 substrates. In conclusion, these results suggest that TDP43 is a new substrate of PS1 and that TDP43 cleaved by PS1 promotes APP expression, which leads to increased Aβ content, which may explain why TDP43 promotes AD development. These insights enhance our understanding of TDP43's role in AD development.",Cell Death Discov
40144555,Feasibility and effects of remotely supervised aerobic training and resistance training in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a pilot three-arm randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effects of different exercise interventions on cognitive function is insufficient.
AIMS: To evaluate the feasibility and effects of remotely supervised aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) interventions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: This study is a 6-month pilot three-arm randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants (n=108) were recruited and randomised to the AE group, RE group or control (CON) group with a 1:1:1 ratio. Interventions were delivered at home with remote supervision. We evaluated participants' global cognition, memory, executive function, attention, physical activity levels, physical performance and muscle strength of limbs at baseline, 3 months (T1) and 6 months (T2) after randomisation. A linear mixed-effects model was adopted for data analyses after controlling for covariates. Tukey's method was used for adjusting for multiple comparisons. Sensitivity analyses were performed after excluding individuals with low compliance rates.
RESULTS: 15 (13.89%) participants dropped out. The median compliance rates in the AE group and RE group were 67.31% and 93.27%, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the scores of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale in the AE group decreased by 2.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.41 to -0.67, t=-2.94, p=0.004) and 1.53 (95% CI -2.88 to -0.17, t=-2.22, p=0.028) points more than those in the CON group at T1 and T2, respectively. The effects of AE were still significant at T1 (estimate=-1.70, 95% CI -3.20 to -0.21, t=-2.69, p=0.021), but lost statistical significance at T2 after adjusting for multiple comparisons. As for executive function, the Stroop time interference in the RE group decreased by 11.76 s (95% CI -21.62 to -1.90, t=-2.81, p=0.015) more than that in the AE group at T2 after Tukey's adjustment. No other significant effects on cognitive functions were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Both remotely supervised AE and RE programmes are feasible in older adults with MCI. AE has positive effects on global cognition, and RE improves executive function.

40130194,Voluntary locomotion induces an early and remote hemodynamic decrease in the large cerebral veins.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Behavior regulates dural and cerebral vessels, with spontaneous locomotion inducing dural vessel constriction and increasing stimulus-evoked cerebral hemodynamic responses. It is vital to investigate the function of different vascular network components, surrounding and within the brain, to better understand the role of the neurovascular unit in health and neurodegeneration.
AIM: We characterized locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses across vascular compartments of the whisker barrel cortex: artery, vein, parenchyma, draining, and meningeal vein.
APPROACH: Using 2D-OIS, hemodynamic responses during locomotion were recorded in 9- to 12-month-old awake mice: wild-type, Alzheimer's disease (AD), atherosclerosis, or mixed (atherosclerosis/AD) models. Within the somatosensory cortex, responses were taken from pial vessels inside the whisker barrel region [(WBR): ""whisker artery"" and ""whisker vein""], a large vein from the sagittal sinus adjacent to the WBR (draining vein), and meningeal vessels from the dura mater (which do not penetrate cortical tissue).
RESULTS: We demonstrate that locomotion evokes an initial decrease in total hemoglobin (HbT) within the draining vein before the increase in HbT within WBR vessels. The locomotion event size influences the magnitude of the HbT increase in the pial vessels of the WBR but not of the early HbT decrease within the draining veins. Following locomotion onset, an early HbT decrease was also observed in the overlying meningeal vessels, which unlike within the cortex did not go on to exceed baseline HbT levels during the remainder of the locomotion response. We show that locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses are altered in disease in the draining vein and whisker artery, suggesting this could be an important neurodegeneration biomarker.
CONCLUSIONS: This initial reduction in HbT within the draining and meningeal veins potentially serves as a ""space-saving"" mechanism, allowing for large increases in cortical HbT associated with locomotion. Given this mechanism is impacted by disease, it may provide an important target for vascular-based therapeutic interventions.",Neurophotonics
40076728,SLC1A4 and Serine Homeostasis: Implications for Neurodevelopmental and Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The solute carrier family 1 member 4 (SLC1A4) gene encodes a neutral amino acid transporter, also referred to as alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1, ASCT1, that helps maintain amino acid balance in the brain and periphery. In the brain, SLC1A4 plays an important role in transporting levo (L) and dopa (D) isomers of serine. L-serine is required for many cellular processes, including protein and sphingolipid synthesis, while D-serine is a co-agonist required for normal neurotransmission through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Through its roles transporting L-serine across the blood-brain barrier and regulating synaptic D-serine levels, SLC1A4 helps establish and maintain brain health across the lifespan.

40134734,"Determination of balance, fall risk, and kinesiophobia in individuals with Alzheimer's Dementia.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine balance, fall risk, and kinesiophobia in individuals with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD).
METHODS: The study was completed with 18 AD and 18 healthy AD-free control group with early or moderate-stage AD diagnosed by a neurologist. Socio-demographic characteristics of the individuals were assessed using an evaluation form, and their balance was evaluated using the Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment Test, Timed Up and Go Test, and Single Leg Standing Test. The Falls Risk Self-Assessment Scale (FRSAS) was used to assess the risk of falls. Kinesiophobia was assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TKS). Additionally, participants underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
RESULT: The mean age of individuals with AD was lower than that of healthy individuals, with means of 69 ± 3.66 years and 65.4 ± 4.10 years, respectively (p = 0.012). The Tinetti balance (p = 0.005), Tinetti gait (p &lt; 0.001), Tinetti total (p &lt; 0.001), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p &lt; 0,001) scores were lower in AD individuals relative to controls. The FRSAS (p &lt; 0.001) scores were higher in AD individuals relative to controls. The TKS scores were found to be similar between individuals with AD and the control group (p = 0.860).
CONCLUSION: It was found that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have poorer balance and a higher risk of falls compared to healthy individuals. In light of these results, balance assessments should be included when developing rehabilitation protocols for individuals with AD. Treatment protocols designed for this patient group must incorporate balance-specific exercise and training programs.

39993947,Utilizing Functionalized Dual-Microbead Interfaces for Measurements of Amyloid-beta (1-42) with Femtomolar Sensitivity.,"The presence of amyloid-beta (1-42) in CSF and plasma has been implicated as a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we demonstrate a high-sensitivity method of detection and quantification for total Aβ42 utilizing two-antibody functionalized microparticles interfaces. Our method of biomarker detection utilizes two types of microbeads: (1) magnetic particles functionalized with monoclonal antibodies and (2) polystyrene particles dual functionalized with monoclonal antibodies and a unique DNA ""tag"". The bead complex that forms in the presence of the target analyte is detected using qPCR to determine the analyte concentration. To demonstrate our method, we tested for the presence of amyloid-beta (1-42) in Tris buffer. The established limit of detection for this assay is 0.05 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> (12.5 femtomolar) in purified samples This study provides an improved method of protein detection that could be used for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",Langmuir
40068480,Association of the HLA-DQB1*02 allele with lower tauopathy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Although many studies have investigated the influence of HLA on the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), there have been inconsistent results. Part of this problem has been attributed to limitations of a clinical assessment in the absence of histopathological confirmation or other quantitative assessments. This study employed a subset of the AD Sequencing Project, representing 2663 cases with histopathological confirmation of AD and confirmation of 881 cognitively normal cases. Two HLA allelic subtypes, DQB1*02:01 and DQB1*02:02, were associated with lower Braak staging, a measure of tauopathy in the brain. These HLA subtypes were also associated with a later age of onset. There was a lower occurrence of HLA-DQB1*02:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 in AD cases compared to cognitively normal cases. For all of the above results, replicative sets were confirmatory. The above results were also maintained for both HLA-DQB1*02:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 when removing the effect of APOE4 or APOE2. Interestingly, the HLA-DQB1*02 allele binds tau better than all other HLA-DQB1 alleles tested, per an in silico assessment, raising the question of whether deletion of tau binding, auto-reactive T-cells in the thymus could reduce the likelihood of the onset of AD?",Arch Gerontol Geriatr
40101857,Shuangxia Decoction attenuates sleep disruption in 5×FAD mice through neuroinflammation inhibition: An integrative analysis of transcriptomic and molecular biology investigations.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory and learning deficits. Circadian rhythm disruption-induced sleep disruption is frequently observed in AD patients. The Shuangxia Decoction (SXD) comprising Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. (Banxia) and Prunella vulgaris L. (Xiakucao), has been effectively used to treate sleep disruption for thousands of years. However, the mechanisms by which SXD treated AD through circadian rhythm-related pathways remain unexplored.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: This research sought to determine the efficacy, mechanisms, and active compounds of SXD in AD treatment via an integrative approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a chronic jet lag (CJL) protocol in wild-type (WT) mice and monitored their rest/activity to compare their rest/activity period among WT, CJL, and CJD + SXD groups. In addition, we evaluated the impact of SXD on the cognitive and Aβ burden of 5 × FAD mice by behavioral tests and Thioflavin staining. The underlying pathway analysis of SXD was revealed through transcriptomic and biology experimental validation. The active compounds of SXD were further analyzed using the UPLC-MS, molecular docking, and cellular thermal shift assay (CESTA).
RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a rapid recovery of rest/activity period in CJL mice following SXD treatment. Additionally, SXD treatment alleviated Aβ plaque accumulation, subsequently preserving cognitive behavior and motor ability in 5 × FAD mice. Moreover, SXD significantly enhanced neuronal synaptic plasticity dendritic plasticity in CA1 neurons of 5 × FAD mice. Transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of the neuroinflammation-related pathway in 5 × FAD mice. Subsequent heatmap analysis indicated a suppression of inflammatory factor secretion (Cd68, Trem2, IL-6, IL-1β, Cxc3r1, Tnf et al.) and an increase of anti-inflammatory factor secretion (IL4, Ccl19, Ccl21a et al.) following SXD treatment in the 5 × FAD mice. Meanwhile, SXD upregulated positive regulators involved in the circadian rhythm like Bmal1 and Clock, and downregulated negative regulators like Nr1d1. Moreover, microglia exhibited an amoeboid morphology characterized by few processes and rounded cell bodies in 5 × FAD mice, whereas the age-matched SXD group maintained microglia with a ramified appearance. Additionally, our study identified 20 major components of SXD and identified 3-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl) lactic acid, Salviaflaside, and Ilexhainanoside D for further molecular docking with REV-ERBα (NR1D1), a commonly used circadian target. Salviaflaside further showed a strong bind with REV-ERBα via CESTA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that SXD may rescue circadian rhythm in 5 × FAD mice through specifically binding to REV-ERBα in microglia to activate the BMAL1/CLOCK pathway, thus inhibiting transcription of inflammatory factors, contributing to alleviating neuroinflammation and impeding AD progression. Our results offer a scientific foundation for developing SXD-based therapies in the early stage of AD, where sleep disruption precedes cognitive decline, offering potential leads for clinical trials to improve sleep quality thus delaying neurodegeneration in AD patients.",J Ethnopharmacol
40022483,The Role of the Urea Cycle in the Alzheimer's Disease Brain.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder classified as the leading form of dementia in the elderly. Classical hallmarks of AD pathology believed to cause AD include Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques as well as neurofibrillary tau tangles (NTT). However, research into these classical hallmarks has failed to account for a causative link or therapeutic success. More recently, metabolic hallmarks of AD pathology have become a popular avenue of research. Elevated urea and ammonia detected in cases of AD point towards a dysfunctional urea cycle involved in AD. This review covers the expansive body of literature surrounding the work of researchers deciphering the role of the urea cycle in AD pathology through the study of urea cycle enzymes, metabolites, and transporters in the AD brain. Urea cycle enzymes of interest in AD pathology include OTC, NOS isoforms, ARG1, ARG2, MAOB, and ODC, which all present as promising therapeutic targets. Urea metabolites indicated in AD pathology have varying concentrations across the regions of the brain and the different cell types (neurons, microglia, astrocytes). Finally, the role of UT-B as a clearance modulator presents this protein as a key target for research in the role of the urea cycle in the AD brain. In the future, these key enzymes, pathways, and proteins relating to the urea cycle in AD should be further investigated to better understand the cell-specific urea cycle profiles in the AD brain and uncover their therapeutic potential.",J Neurochem
40086116,Dual single nucleotide polymorphisms typing of apolipoprotein E gene based on double restriction endonuclease with lambda exonuclease and triple helix molecular switch assistance.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are critical determinants of disease susceptibility, pathogenesis, and drug response, underscoring the need for their accurate monitoring in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a novel apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping method for the rapid and precise identification of six genotypes (ε2/ε2, ε3/ε3, ε4/ε4, ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4, and ε3/ε4). The method utilizes restriction endonucleases AflIII and HaeII to selectively cleave the rs429358 and rs7412 sites, thereby generating distinct double-stranded DNA fragments. These fragments are subsequently processed by Lambda exonuclease to produce single-stranded DNA, which binds to a triple-helix molecular switch (THMS) and induces its conformational transition into a hairpin structure, resulting in a fluorescence change. The optimized assay exhibits a linear detection range of 5-1000 copies with a minimum detection limit of 2 copies for the rs429358 site, and a range of 10-1000 copies with a minimum detection limit of 6 copies for the rs7412 site. Furthermore, the method was validated using clinical samples from 10 Alzheimer's disease patients, achieving complete concordance with sequencing results, which underlines the high specificity and sensitivity of the method and demonstrates its potential as a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Biosens Bioelectron
40152853,Acute Delirium From Urinary Retention in Elderly Women With Alzheimer's Disease: A Case of Female Cystocerebral Syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a frequent and complex condition among elderly patients in emergency departments, often requiring rapid assessment and intervention. Emergency nurses are integral to identifying reversible causes of delirium, such as urinary retention.
CASE PRESENTATION: Cystocerebral syndrome, a rare but significant condition predominantly observed in males, is characterized by delirium triggered by acute urinary retention and reversible with bladder decompression. This report details the first documented female case: an 80-year-old patient with Alzheimer's disease presenting with hypoactive delirium, marked by reduced speech and mobility. Through comprehensive nursing assessment, bladder distention was identified as the underlying cause. After catheterization, the patient's symptoms resolved within 10 minutes, confirming the diagnosis of cystocerebral syndrome.

40140230,Association between herpesviruses and alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis based on case-control studies.,"Herpesviruses infection has been found to be implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the results remain controversial. This systematic meta-analysis was aimed to evaluate the relationship between Herpesviruses infection and the risk of developing AD. Relevant literature was searched from five databases, including CNKI, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to obtain case-control studies (published between the date of database establishment and February 2025; no language restrictions) that compared the Herpesviruses positivity in AD patients and healthy controls. Among all existing studies, there are more abundant published case-control studies on the relationship between HSV-1, HCMV and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we chose these two viruses to further explore their association with Alzheimer's disease. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by the NOS scale. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for meta-analysis. Publication bias was investigated using the funnel plots, Begg's and Egger's publication bias plots. Twenty-one eligible studies were included to investigate the association between HSV-1 and AD. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that HSV-1 infection is a risk factor for AD (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = (1.14-1.69), P < 0.05)). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled ORs of HSV-1 infection associated with AD were 1.28 (95% CI: 0.74-2.22) in literature prior to 2010;1.44 (95% CI: 1.14-1.82) in literature after 2010; 1.27(95% CI: 1.01-1.60) in studies from Europe; 1.22(95% CI: 0.66-2.27) in studies from North America;1.89 (95% CI: 1.19-3.02) in studies from Asia; 1.38 (95% CI: 1.10-1.74) in the clinical diagnosis group; 1.52 (95% CI: 0.84-2.74) in the autopsy group. The pooled OR of APOE4 positivity and AD risk was 5.51 (95% CI: 4.33-7.01). The association between HCMV and AD was analyzed in seven studies. The pooled result showed that HCMV infection is not a risk factor for AD (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.63-1.09). Our latest meta-analysis suggests that HSV-1 infection is a risk factor for the risk of AD. Therefore, anti-HSV-1 infection can serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for control of AD incidence. There is insufficient evidence to support association between HCMV and AD.",Mol Cell Biochem
40167963,Voxel-wise insights into early Alzheimer's disease pathology progression: the association with APOE and memory decline.,"Longitudinal investigation of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype's impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker progression, focusing on amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and gray matter (GM) atrophy, integrating cognitive decline and baseline levels. Longitudinal florbetapir-PET and T1-weighted MRI data from 100 cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impaired (MCI) participants both with considerable global Aβ accumulation (""high Aβ accumulators"") were analyzed using a voxel-wise approach. Associations of APOE genotype and memory decline with Aβ accumulation and GM atrophy were examined separately for each neuroimaging modality, controlling for baseline Aβ levels and diagnosis. Alternatively, the effect of baseline diagnosis, while controlling for memory decline, was investigated. A multimodal analysis evaluated interactions between genotype, memory decline, and GM atrophy on Aβ accumulation. High Aβ accumulators displayed extensive Aβ pathology predominantly in the medial orbito-frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and precuneus, along with GM atrophy in temporal, occipital, orbito-frontal, and parietal areas. ɛ4 carriers with memory decline exhibited greater Aβ accumulation and GM atrophy in selective regions compared to non-carriers with memory decline, while no genotype difference was observed in individuals without decline. No interaction effect was observed for MCI diagnosis. Regional associations between the two biomarkers were similarly dependent on genotype and memory decline. ɛ4 carriers exhibiting memory decline present an accelerated neurobiological pattern at predementia stages, supporting early ɛ4 carrier monitoring and interventions in this at-risk group. Importantly, memory decline might be more informative than MCI regarding AD pathology progression emphasizing the importance of repeated cognitive assessments.",Geroscience
40121956,Efficient strategy for alleviating neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress damage of Alzheimer's disease through dual targeting BCL-2 gene promoter i-motif and β-amyloid.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal metabolism of β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor proteins and neuronal apoptosis, ultimately leading to cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and current single-target therapies are not effective in preventing the rapid progression of AD, which highlights the urgent need for developing multi-target drugs. In this study, a series of compounds were synthesized through a multi-targeting ligand strategy. After extensive screening and evaluation, we found a lead compound B14, which showed excellent dual targeting ability for effectively alleviating neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress damage of AD. In our molecular and cellular level experiments, B14 could target and stabilize the i-motif structure formed on the BCL-2 promoter to upregulate BCL-2 expression, which could also bind to Aβ and inhibit its deposition. In the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced cell model, B14 could maintain mitochondrial function and number, regulate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism disorders, and effectively reduce Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced apoptosis. Further studies showed that B14 also exhibited good ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which significantly improved learning memory and cognitive deficits, reduced brain Aβ plaques, alleviated inflammation and restored oxidative stress markers in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings provide an innovative strategy of dual targeting BCL-2 promoter i-motif for transcriptional regulation and Aβ aggregation synergistically for mitigating AD pathologies. B14 represents a promising multi-target lead compound with a good potential for further development for AD treatment.",Redox Biol
39979530,Awareness of national dementia guidelines and management of oldest-old and frail people living with dementia: a European survey of geriatricians.,"BACKGROUND: Management of dementia, particularly the use of pharmacological treatments, in the oldest old and those with frailty is complex because of the multiple types of dementia, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and side effects. Current national dementia guidelines lack recommendations for this group. This study assessed guideline awareness, usage, and pharmacological management practices for dementia in the oldest old and frail across Europe.
METHODS: An online anonymous survey was distributed in 2023 to the European Geriatric Medicine Society Dementia Special Interest Group and their contacts to investigate guideline awareness and pharmacological practices for the oldest old and frail. The CHERRIES checklist was followed for reporting. Responses were summarized using descriptive statistics and quotations of free text responses.
RESULTS: Forty-nine responses from fourteen countries were received. A total of 76.6% were aware of a national dementia guideline and 86.9% applied it frequently. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were generally used as a first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) (91.6% and 93.4%). Memantine was added or replaced AChEIs as dementia severity progresses. Gingko biloba was considered in mild and moderate AD (23.6% and 22.7%, respectively). Off-label drug use was common in other types of dementia. 88.5% of respondents reported no difference in treatment compared with a younger population.
CONCLUSION: There was awareness of various dementia guidelines, but none addressed the management of the oldest old and frail. Most respondents did not adapt their practices for this group, but many reported off-label treatments which resulted in non-evidence-based prescribing, overprescribing, and a lack of deprescribing. European consensus to guide the management of dementia in this complex population is needed.",Eur Geriatr Med
40026922,Impact of Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Spatial Learning and Memory in Acrolein-Induced Alzheimer's Disease-Like Hippocampal Neuronal Damage in Wistar Rats.,"BACKGROUND: Data about the utility of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a potential therapy for neurodegenerative disorders are still inconclusive. We used a rat model of acrolein-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration to investigate the effect of VNS on spatial learning and memory.
METHODS: A total of 24 Wistar rats were randomly allocated to one of the four groups: no acrolein exposure (n = 6), control (n = 6), sham (n = 6), and experimental (n = 6). The control, sham, and experimental groups were exposed to acrolein 2.5 mg/kg/day by gastric gavage for eight weeks. After acrolein exposure, the experimental and sham groups received transcutaneous auricular VNS and greater auricular nerve stimulation, respectively, under 2% isoflurane anesthesia for four weeks. Then, all animal groups were assessed for spatial learning and memory in a Morris water maze before being euthanized for hippocampus histological examination.
RESULTS:  The mean time to find the hidden platform varied significantly between the no acrolein exposure group and each of the acrolein-exposed groups. The results of one-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference in the average swimming time between the four study groups (F = 14.64, p < 0.001). Results from the post-hoc analysis indicated that the mean difference was statistically significant between the ""no acrolein exposure"" and ""control"" groups (p < 0.001), the ""no acrolein exposure"" and ""experimental"" groups (p = 0.001), and between the ""control"" and ""sham"" groups (p< 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in swimming time to find the hidden escape platform between the sham and experimental groups (p = 0.060).
CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous auricular VNS has no significant effect on spatial learning or memory in Wistar rats with acrolein-induced hippocampus neuronal damage, indicating the need to review the long-standing notion that hippocampal neuronal loss causes spatial navigation deficits.",Cureus

Diagnostic biomarker potential was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. An analysis of Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was performed in order to determine the amount of immune cell infiltration. We analyzed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment using the KEGG.ResultsWGCNA identified modules linked to bone metabolism, ssGSEA showed unique gene enrichment patterns, and 268 genes were found to be differentially expressed in sarcopenia. Fourteen co-expression modules related to bone metabolism were identified, with one showing a strong positive correlation. KEGG pathway analysis indicated downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system and Alzheimer's disease pathways. The differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in adipocyte differentiation.ConclusionThis study analyzes genetic changes and immune cell patterns in sarcopenia, providing insights into its causes and potential diagnostic markers for future research on treatments.",Technol Health Care
40058720,SNAP-25: A biomarker of synaptic loss in neurodegeneration.,"Synaptic dysfunction is one of the most important markers of neurodegenerative diseases, which contribute to cognitive decline and the loss of neurons. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a member of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which plays a significant role in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and the release of neurotransmitters. Recent studies have shown that expression levels of SNAP-25 are altered in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). These investigations led to the consideration of SNAP-25 as a potential biomarker of synaptic degeneration. Understanding the role of SNAP-25 in neurodegeneration will aid in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic development, and will also provide new insights into synaptic dysfunction as a main feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this paper explores the physiological role of SNAP-25, its involvement in synaptic pathology, and the implications of its dysregulation in neurodegenerative conditions, such as AD, HD, and CJD. Literature regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SNAP-25 levels as a diagnostic marker were reviewed and its applications in detecting the progression of the disease have been discussed. Additionally, the limitations of SNAP-25 as a biomarker, including variability across studies and the need for further validation have been addressed.",Clin Chim Acta
40111918,Altered face perception in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: Evidence from representational similarity analysis of event-related potential.,"BackgroundStructural changes in medial temporal lobes including the fusiform gyrus, a critical area in face recognition, precede the progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how the neural correlates of face processing altered in aMCI, as well as their association with cognitive impairments, remain unclear.ObjectiveUsing electroencephalogram (EEG), we explored the electrophysiological markers of face-specific visual processing alterations in aMCI and examined their relationship with cognitive deficits.MethodsWe recruited participants with aMCI (n = 32) and healthy controls (HC, n = 41) and used a passive viewing task to measure the event-related potential (ERP) in response to faces and non-face objects. To compare face processing in aMCI patients and HCs, we adopted mass univariate analysis and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to explore aMCI-related alterations in ERPs.ResultsWe found that face inversion effect (FIE) in P1 amplitudes was absent in aMCI patients. Also, compared to HCs, aMCI patients exhibited a lack of right hemisphere advantage in N170 in response to faces. Furthermore, representation similarity analysis of ERP in posterior-temporal regions revealed that aMCI patients represent face and non-face objects distinctively from HCs in the early processing stage. Additionally, the FIE in P1 amplitude positively correlated to aMCI patients' visuospatial functions.ConclusionsThese findings showed aMCI-related changes in the early perceptual processing of faces and highlights the potential of the FIE in P1 amplitude and ERP patterns over occipital-temporal regions as electrophysiological markers for aMCI and AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40112274,Incidence of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities in Phase III Clinical Trials of Anti-Amyloid-β Immunotherapy: An Updated Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are key safety considerations in anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapy. ARIA can be categorized into 2 types: ARIA characterized by edema and effusion (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages and superficial siderosis (ARIA-H). In this study, we assessed the incidence of ARIA in phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-Aβ immunotherapy and compared the incidence among different agents and APOE ε4 carrier status.
METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were searched for phase 3 RCTs of anti-Aβ immunotherapy published on or before May 23, 2024. The inclusion criteria were phase 3 trials of anti-Aβ immunotherapy for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease (AD) or mild AD dementia, with sufficient data on ARIA-E/H. The pooled incidences of ARIA and subgroup analyses according to various agents and APOE ε4 carrier status were calculated. A sensitivity analysis excluding outliers was performed. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of ARIA-E according to the APOE ε4 carrier status was also calculated.
RESULTS: Nine phase 3 RCT cohorts from 8 eligible studies were identified, analyzing data from 6,315 patients. The pooled incidence of ARIA-E was 9.5% (95% CI 2.8%-27.3%), and the adjusted pooled incidence of ARIA-E was 25.5% (95% CI 20.4%-31.8%) in the sensitivity analysis. The pooled incidence of symptomatic ARIA-E was 6.7% (95% CI 3.5%-12.5%) and that of severe ARIA-E was 3.5% (95% CI 13.8%-8.4%). The pooled incidence of ARIA-H was 17.8% (95% CI 11.0%-27.5%), with the incidence of superficial siderosis was 9.3% (95% CI 6.1%-13.9%). The pooled incidence of isolated ARIA-H was 8.7% (95% CI 7.6%-10.1%). Subgroup analysis showed that homozygous APOE ε4 carriers had significantly higher odds of developing ARIA-E (OR 5.6, 95% CI 3.8-8.2, p &lt; 0.001) than noncarriers. Heterozygous APOE ε4 carriers also had significantly higher odds of developing ARIA-E (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.4, p &lt; 0.001) than noncarriers.
DISCUSSION: Although limited by small sample size and cohort-level data, our meta-analysis shows the adjusted pooled incidence of ARIA-E was 25.5% and the pooled incidence of ARIA-H was 17.8% in the recent phase 3 RCTs of anti-Aβ immunotherapy. Homozygous APOE ε4 carriers have a 5.6-fold higher risk of developing ARIA-E than noncarriers.",Neurology

40057214,Efficient removal of naturally-occurring lipofuscin autofluorescence in human nervous tissue using high-intensity white light.,"Background autofluorescence is enhanced in human tissue relative to small animals and presents a barrier to fully realizing the potential of novel multiplex methods in human studies. In particular, lipofuscin (LF) is an interfering pigment in multiplex fluorescence assays. Lipofuscin (LF) is a highly cross-linked aggregate of oxidized lipids, proteins, sugars, and metal ions that accumulates in lysosomes with age, and is strongly fluorescent across wavelengths that interfere with signals from common fluorophores. This is particularly apparent in dorsal root ganglion (DRG), where the LF deposits occupy up to 80% of the visible neuronal cytoplasm, affecting ∼45% of neurons in a typical section. This report describes a straightforward, scalable, pre-staining, white-light photobleaching method that near-totally reduces LF autofluorescence, and improves signal detection across the color spectrum without negatively impacting the multiplex fluorescence detection assay. It is effective for peripheral and central nervous system structures as well as pathological tissue such as Alzheimer's disease brain, which contains high levels of autofluorescent interference. This demonstrates the broad applicability to improving signal detection in human disease states to enable translational investigations in humans. This low-cost procedure can be rapidly implemented into existing research programs to increase the accessibility of high-plex fluorescent microscopy methodologies to enable direct-in-human research. PERSPECTIVE: White light photobleaching of lipofuscin before multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization allows for rapid, near-total quenching of autofluorescence in healthy and diseased human nervous system tissue. Given the importance of direct-in-human investigations for validating translational studies and ensuring medical relevance, this simple yet powerful advance enables future anatomical investigations.",J Pain

40133202,[Effects of nicotine exposure on endogenous metabolites in mouse brain based on metabolomics and mass spectrometry imaging].,"Nicotine, the principal alkaloid in tobacco, exhibits significant central nervous system activity and induces a wide array of physiological effects. In addition to its well-documented role in tobacco dependence, previous studies have suggested that nicotine also has diverse pharmacological properties. These include alleviating symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, potentially reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, mitigating oxidative stress, as well as anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic effects. Neuroscientists frequently use an array of molecular biology techniques to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of nicotine on the central nervous system. However, disease onset is invariably accompanied by metabolic dysfunction, and organisms often exhibit complex and unpredictable responses to pharmacological stimuli. As a bioactive alkaloid with potent pharmacological properties, nicotine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and induce brain-compound changes, which serves as the basis for its effects on the central nervous system. Consequently, examining the extensive impact of nicotine exposure on endogenous metabolites and metabolic pathways in the brain is an indispensable step toward providing a more robust foundation for understanding the complex physiological effects of nicotine. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic-analysis method was established to systematically examine the effects of repeated nicotine exposure on endogenous metabolites in mouse brains. Two chromatographic systems fitted with Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) and BEH C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) columns were used to determine the nicotine present in samples. As a result, the established UHPLC-MS/MS method identified a total of 759 endogenous metabolites. Compared with the saline group, nicotine exposure resulted in 575 significantly different metabolites, with 434 metabolites down-regulated and 141 up-regulated. Further pathway-enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that nicotine exposure primarily affects essential-amino-acid, lipid, nucleotide, carbohydrate, cofactor, and vitamin metabolism, as well as other amino-acid metabolic pathways in the brain. Although non-targeted metabolomics can simultaneously detect and analyze all small-molecule metabolites in an unbiased manner, accurately capturing metabolite changes in specific brain regions is challenging when dealing with complex brain-tissue systems. Targeting the aggregation of material bases and the delivery of precision treatment to certain brain regions is expected to be significant for the targeted therapy of central nervous system diseases. Airflow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI) was further used to directly visualize the nicotine-induced distributions and variations of differentially expressed metabolites in various brain regions, which revealed that nicotine exposure leads to the significant downregulation of choline, serine, aspartate, and malate levels throughout the brain. Specifically, taurine, acetylcholine, and adenosine levels were notably affected in the cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions, respectively. Essential-amino-acid metabolism was most affected by nicotine, with lipid metabolism found to be the next-most affected pathway. These metabolic pathways predominantly affected the cortical region, whereas the striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum were affected to varying degrees. These findings provide novel experimental evidence that enhances our understanding of metabolic biomarkers associated with nicotine exposure.",Se Pu
40004442,"Unravelling the Relationship Between Height, Lean Mass, Alzheimer's Disease and Cognition Through Mendelian Randomization.","BACKGROUND: Genetic evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses suggests that higher lean mass causally protects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhances cognitive function. However, the potential confounding role of height, which shares genetic etiology with lean mass, has not been fully examined.
METHODS: Genetic predictors of whole-body lean mass were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in the UK Biobank cohort (UKB; n = 448,322). Genetic predictors of height were also obtained from UKB (height<sub>0.5M</sub> = 455,332) and from a GWAS meta-analysis (height<sub>1.5M</sub>n = 1,578,425). The study outcomes included clinically diagnosed AD (21,982 cases and 41,944 controls) and cognitive performance (n = 269,867). All study participants were of European ancestry. We conducted univariable and multivariable MR analyses to examine the total and independent effects of lean mass and height on the specified outcomes under different statistical adjustment strategies.
RESULTS: In univariable MR analyses, genetically proxied lean mass (odds ratio [OR] per 1-standard deviation [SD] increase 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.91, p = 3.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and height (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, p = 0.001) were associated with reduced risk of AD. Genetically proxied lean mass (β 0.10, 95% CI 0.08-0.12, p = 6.24 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and height (β 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, p = 1.16 × 10<sup>-15</sup>) were further associated with improved cognitive performance. In multivariable MR analyses, adjustment for height<sub>1.5M</sub> partially attenuated the lean mass association with AD (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74-1.12, p = 0.40), whereas the height<sub>1.5M</sub>-AD association remained similar after adjusting for lean mass (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, p = 0.04). Adjustment for height also attenuated the association of lean mass with cognitive performance (β 0.00, 95% CI -0.07-0.06, p = 0.94), whereas height maintained a similar association with improved cognitive performance after adjustment for lean mass (β 0.07, 95% CI 0.03-0.10, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Height may confound the genetic associations between lean mass and both cognitive performance and AD risk. Residual direct effects of lean mass on AD risk cannot be excluded due to limitations in statistical power and genetic instrument strength in MVMR. These findings emphasize the necessity of adjusting for height when using MR to investigate the clinical effects of lean mass.",Genes (Basel)
40107366,Potential mechanism and efficacy evaluation of transcranial focused ultrasound therapy for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Transcranial focused ultrasound (TFU) is emerging as a promising non-invasive therapy capable of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. TFU potentially allows the transfer of therapeutic agents to targeted brain areas for patients affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
NEW METHOD: The efficacy and mechanism of TFU in modulating BBB permeability in key brain regions, including the hippocampus and frontal lobe, are investigated in this research. A total of 20 participants aged 60-85 years were involved with AD. The treatment protocol involved three TFU sessions, spaced three weeks apart. The research encompasses pre-assessment and post-assessment of treatment with follow-up ranging from 5 to 12 months.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis involved paired t-tests to compare pre- and post-treatment cognitive scores, and ANOVA to predict significant differences in amyloid reduction across different brain regions, with the high decrease observed in the hippocampus. Multivariate Analysis (MANOVA) to explore the combined effect of cognitive and amyloid data. Linear Regression Analysis to predict cognitive improvement from amyloid plaque reduction. Longitudinal analysis for time-to-event analysis assessing the durability of effects over time.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Florbetaben Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans demonstrated a reduction in β-amyloid plaque burden, with a 15 % average decrease in the treated brain regions. No adverse effects on disease progression were observed up to 1 year after treatment.
CONCLUSION: This analysis presents the largest cohort of AD patients treated with TFU, with the longest follow-up to date. The treatment demonstrated safety and feasibility, with reversible BBB opening in multiple brain regions.",J Neurosci Methods
40034366,Gut microbiome synthesizes important core metabolites to prevent cognitive decline and mitigate onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: This study explores how gut metabolites, produced through bacterial metabolism in the gut, influence neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Key metabolites such as succinate and short-chain fatty acids signal through the autonomic nervous system and can cross the blood-brain barrier, impacting central nervous system functions.
OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the role of the gut microbiota in compensating for metabolic deficiencies in AD. By analyzing wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice, the study investigates how the microbiome affects key metabolic processes and whether it can slow AD progression.
METHODS: High-throughput sequencing data from the gut microbiomes of APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice and age-matched WT C57BL/6 male mice were analyzed for microbial and metabolite profiles.
RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed differences in microbial composition between groups. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and Anosim confirmed distinct microbiome profiles in WT and APP/PS1 mice. At the genus level, Vescimonas was more abundant in WT mice, while Odoribacter, Lacrimispora, Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Alloprevotella were more prevalent in APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: While taxonomic differences did not directly link specific microorganisms to AD, functional analysis identified key metabolites-acetyl-CoA, glucose, succinate, lipids, choline, and acetylcholine-that may alleviate energy deficits and synaptic dysfunction. This study suggests that the microbiome may help compensate for AD-related impairments, opening avenues for microbiome-based therapies.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40154100,Molecular insights into anti-inflammatory activities of selected Indian herbs.,"Inflammation is a universal response of mammalian tissue to harm, comprising reactions to injuries, pathogens, and foreign particles. Chronic inflammation, often present in allergies and autoimmune disorders, poses significant risks, potentially leading to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. It can also be a common precursor to cancer. However, Contemporary therapies like NSAIDs and corticosteroids often provide incomplete relief from chronic inflammation and carry significant side effects, underscoring the need for exploring traditional and plant-based medicines for new, effective treatments. As such, there is a growing demand for natural bioactive substances for health maintenance and disease risk reduction. Traditional and plant-based medicines, long-used in managing inflammation and other disorders, hold promise for the discovery of bioactive lead compounds and subsequent drug development for treating inflammatory disorders. This review encompasses an extensive study of the anti-inflammatory potential of selected traditional Indian herbal medicines and the associated pharmacological mechanisms of action. The inflammatory process often entails the activation of transcription factors, induction of various signaling cascades, gene expression, activation of inflammatory enzymes, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inflammatory or immune cells. Detailed exploration of active components in traditional herbal medicines such as the Neem (Azadirachta indica), Salai guggul (Boswellia serrata), Green tea (Camellia sinensis), Saffron (Crocus sativus), Turmeric (Curcuma longa), Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana), Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia), Black cumin (Nigella sativa), Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), and Ginger (Zingiber officinale) reveals their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The in-depth study of these plants provides insight into their potential applications in managing inflammatory disorders. Further research and development are necessary to substantiate these findings and translate them into clinically effective therapeutics.",J Ayurveda Integr Med
40025904,Enhancing Lateral Resolution Using Two-Colour Direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy to Unravel Synaptic Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease.,"AIMS: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological accumulation of tau in synapses contributes to synapse dysfunction and loss. However, the small and complex structure of synapses limits the investigation when using conventional techniques. In this work, we describe the combination of array tomography (AT) with two-colour direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to enhance lateral resolution for resolving synaptic terminals in human postmortem brain.
METHODS: We applied this combination to study synapses in brain samples (from biopsy and postmortem) from healthy subjects and pathological synaptic tau (aggregates and oligomers) in samples from AD patients.
RESULTS: AT combined with dSTORM allowed the characterisation of the orientation and shape of the synaptic terminals and the synaptic cleft. In addition, this combination confirmed the presence of oligomeric tau in synaptic terminals in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that the combination of AT and two-colour dSTORM provides optimal resolution to detect pathological synaptic tau and its spatial relationship with presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol
40103929,Associations of varicose veins with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies in adults without dementia: the CABLE study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found a correlation between varicose veins (VVs) and cognitive decline, and individuals with VVs have a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associations between VVs and the core pathologies of AD have not yet been investigated. The research was designed to analyze the relationships between VVs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathologies.
METHODS: We included 1,298 participants from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) database without dementia. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was applied to assess the relationships between the VVs and CSF AD biomarkers. Then, we conducted subgroup analyses according to age, gender, education levels and apolipoprotein E genotype ε4 (APOE-ε4) carrier status. Additionally, mediation effects were assessed using causal mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations.
RESULTS: In total subjects, VVs had negative correlations with CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> (β = -0.157, p = 0.038) and CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio (β = -0.272, p &lt; 0.001), as well as positive correlations with CSF Aβ<sub>40</sub> (β = 0.170, p = 0.024), CSF p-tau (β = 0.192, p = 0.008), CSF t-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio (β = 0.190, p = 0.011), and CSF p-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio (β = 0.248, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex, education levels and APOE-ε4 carrier status. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the relations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers were more significant in female, mid-life adults (40-65 years), less-educated individuals and APOE-ε4 non-carriers. Moreover, CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio might be a partial mediator of the association between VVs and p-tau pathology.
CONCLUSION: Our study found correlations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers, suggesting that VVs may be a potential risk factor for the development of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci
40011173,Lecanemab for early Alzheimer's disease: Appropriate use recommendations from the French federation of memory clinics.,"Lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody targeting β-amyloid protofibrils, has shown promising results in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been approved by the European Medicines Agency. An Early Market Authorization could be submitted to the French regulatory agencies, potentially allowing for the drug's use in clinical practice in France in 2025. To guide French clinicians in administering lecanemab in a standardized way, the French Federation of Memory Clinics has developed appropriate use recommendations for lecanemab that highlight relevant questions established to ensure an optimal risk-benefit ratio. The recommendations emphasize that lecanemab treatment requires a comprehensive individualized evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio, which should occur in multidisciplinary meetings. When approved, the guidelines support the use of blood biomarkers, proposing specific cutoffs for patients eligible for lecanemab under restricted conditions. In addition to the European Medicines Agency restrictions in patients on anticoagulants, and APOE4 homozygotes, the guidelines recommend against lecanemab treatment for patients with high amyloid-related hemorrhagic risk such as probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Boston criteria v1.5) until further data become available. Additionally, we recommend that MRI monitoring be started before the third infusion to account for early Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) occurring on lecanemab. It is recommended to establish a specific clinical care pathway with protocols for patients with ARIA, with trained physicians and radiologists with expertise in neurological emergency and intensive care. Finally, a discontinuation protocol based on dementia severity assessment after 18 months of lecanemab treatment is suggested. Access to lecanemab requires a personalized biological and genetic diagnosis of AD, which is currently not necessary in most cases. Therefore, the healthcare system must rapidly adjust to new diagnostic procedures and treatment delivery to ensure equal access for all individuals.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40015298,"Associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, p-tau181, and cognition in healthy older adults with memory complaints: a secondary analysis from the MAPT.","BACKGROUND: Physical activity provides benefits against cognitive decline but its associations with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology are not fully understood. We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and phosphorylated (p)-tau181 blood concentrations, and the role of p-tau181 in the associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition.
METHODS: In this post-hoc secondary analysis, we used data from a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial (the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial [MAPT]), in which adults aged 70 years and older were recruited from the community in 13 memory centres in France and Monaco. Individuals were eligible if they met at least one of the following criteria: spontaneous memory complaints, low gait speed (≤0·77 m/s), or limitation in at least one instrumental activity of daily living. Exclusion criteria included a dementia diagnosis, a Mini Mental State Examination score below 24, and having limitations in basic activities of daily living. For this secondary analysis, participants from MAPT were included if they had blood p-tau181 concentrations measured at baseline or at 3 years, or both timepoints. Self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (in metabolic equivalent of task min per week) and a cognitive composite score (calculated by averaging the Z scores of four cognitive tests) were assessed at baseline and at 6 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years. Mixed-effect models were used to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and p-tau181 concentrations and to explore the mediating and moderating role of p-tau181 concentration on the association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition.
FINDINGS: Between May 30, 2008, and Feb 24, 2011, 1679 individuals were enrolled in the MAPT, of whom 558 adults had measurements of p-tau181 concentrations at baseline, 3 years, or both timepoints. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were associated with slower changes in p-tau181 concentrations over time. Compared with inactive individuals, those with low levels of activity (low moderate-to-vigorous physical activity × time: B = -0·109 [95% CI -0·206 to -0·012; p=0·028]) or high levels of activity (high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity × time: B=-0·114 [95% CI -0·208 to -0·020; p=0·018) had a slower increase in p-tau181 concentrations. We did not identify any association between baseline p-tau181 concentrations and baseline moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition were attenuated with increasing baseline p-tau181 concentrations. Specifically, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was no longer favourably associated with the cognitive composite score when baseline p-tau181 concentration exceeded 9·36 pg/mL and 3·5 pg/mL for the cross-sectional association and longitudinal association, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that engaging in more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity might help to slow the age-related neurodegenerative process, although p-tau pathophysiology seems to mitigate the beneficial associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition in older adults. Verification of these findings in larger population samples will be needed.

40118333,Donepezil alleviates hepatic steatosis by mitigating ER stress via the AMPK/autophagy pathway.,"Donepezil (Do), a drug known for its ability to reduce neuronal inflammation and for its use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has shown promise in combating hepatic lipid accumulation in hyperlipidemic conditions and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a factor associated with alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which these problems are alleviated have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of Do on hepatic lipid metabolism through both in vitro and in vivo studies. We examined the expression of proteins associated with lipogenesis and ER stress via immunoblot analysis, and hepatic lipid accumulation was assessed via oil red O staining. In addition, autophagosome formation was analyzed by counting MDC-positive cells. Our results demonstrated that Do treatment improved hepatic lipid metabolism and reduced the expression of ER stress markers, resulting in decreased lipogenic lipid deposition and apoptosis in the hepatocytes and livers of hyperlipidemic mice. Mechanistically, knocking down AMPK or inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3 MA) attenuated the effects of Do on palmitate-exposed hepatocytes. These results suggest that Do alleviates hepatic ER stress via the AMPK/autophagy pathway and AMPK-mediated fatty acid oxidation, resulting in improved hepatic lipid metabolism and reduced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis. Our study provides evidence that Do may be a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).",Mol Cell Endocrinol
40026671,Evaluation of altered cell-cell communication between glia and neurons in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice at two time points.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting behavior, speech, and motor abilities. The neuropathology of AD includes the formation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, along with neuronal loss. Although neuronal loss is an AD hallmark, cell-cell communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations maintains neuronal health and brain homeostasis. To study changes in cell-cell communication during disease progression, we performed snRNA-sequencing of the hippocampus from female 3xTg-AD and wild-type littermates at 6 and 12 months. We inferred differential cell-cell communication between 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice across time points and between senders (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs) and receivers (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) of interest. We also assessed the downstream effects of altered glia-neuron communication using pseudobulk differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and gene regulatory analyses. We found that glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated in 12-month 3xTg-AD mice. We also identified 23 AD-associated ligand-receptor pairs that are upregulated in the 12-month-old 3xTg-AD hippocampus. Our results suggest increased AD association of interactions originating from microglia. Signaling mediators were not significantly differentially expressed but showed altered gene regulation and transcription factor activity. Our findings indicate that altered glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated and affects the gene regulatory mechanisms in neurons of 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice.",J Cell Commun Signal
40123238,Differential effects of 2 and 4 weeks repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation inducing neuroplasticity on cognitive improvement.,"BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an efficient intervention for alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the optimal treatment duration for high efficacy remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study investigates the effects of 2-week and 4-week rTMS on neural network plasticity and cognitive improvement, aiming to identify the optimal treatment duration for cognitive impairment.MethodsrTMS was administered to cognitively impaired patients over 2-week and 4-week periods, exploring its effects on cognitive improvement and induced neural circuits. The study also examines the predictive value of these neural circuits for individual treatment responses.ResultsThe 4-week rTMS treatment significantly outperformed the 2-week course in improving cognitive function. Neural activity analysis identified the precuneus as a key region for episodic memory. Changes in brain regions, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and motor network (MN), were associated with cognitive improvements. Baseline functional connectivity in these regions predicted changes in general cognition (r = 0.724, p < 0.001) and episodic memory (r = 0.447, p = 0.022) after rTMS.ConclusionsExtended rTMS treatment enhances cognitive performance in cognitive impairment patients, with the 4-week course showing superior effects. Reduced connectivity in the DMN following rTMS was linked to cognitive improvements. The neural network baseline can predict patients' treatment responses.",J Alzheimers Dis

Hypergraphs allow for the representation of higher-order relations, called hyperedges, spanning possibly more than two nodes to capture complex correlations within multimodal medical data and patients' characteristics. We propose a dynamic bi-clustering approach to learn a multi-hypergraph structure based on node embedding to model high-order multimodal patient interaction.

40107524,Preparation and NMR characterization of Aβ peptides at pathological pH.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive deterioration of cognitive function. Its pathological hallmarks include the formation of amyloid plaques, which are primarily due to the abnormal aggregation of Aβ peptides. However, the propensity of Aβ peptides for aggregation makes the in vitro preparation very challenging, often resulting in low yield, instability, and impurities. Here in this study, we developed an in vitro method for preparing monomeric Aβ peptides to achieve stable and high-purity samples. Specifically, three strategies including the uses of high concentration of protein denaturant urea, alkaline buffer (ammonium carbonate buffer), and organic solvents (acetonitrile, hexafluoroisopropanol) were applied to prevent Aβ aggregation during the purification. Through an optimized production process, we successfully obtained stable and highly pure <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C-doubly labeled monomeric Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides suitable for NMR data collection at the pathological acidic pH. Overall, the preparation method presented here offer a robust approach for in vitro production of monomeric Aβ peptides with satisfying purity and reproducibility. Meanwhile, the NMR characterization results for Aβ40 and Aβ42 at pH 6.5 provide useful information for the further biophysical studies involving these two peptides.",Protein Expr Purif
40140622,Blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and incident dementia in the community.,"Evidence regarding the clinical validity of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population is limited. We estimated the hazard and predictive performance of six AD blood biomarkers for incident all-cause and AD dementia-the ratio of amyloid-β 42 to amyloid-β 40 and levels of tau phosphorylated at T217 (p-tau217), tau phosphorylated at T181 (p-tau181), total tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-in a cohort of 2,148 dementia-free older adults from Sweden, who were followed for up to 16 years. In multi-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated baseline levels of p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP were associated with a significantly increased hazard for all-cause and AD dementia, displaying a non-linear dose-response relationship. Elevated concentrations of p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP demonstrated strong predictive performance (area under the curve ranging from 70.9% to 82.6%) for 10-year all-cause and AD dementia, with negative predictive values exceeding 90% but low positive predictive values (PPVs). Combining p-tau217 with NfL or GFAP further improved prediction, with PPVs reaching 43%. Our findings suggest that these biomarkers have the potential to rule out impending dementia in community settings, but they might need to be combined with other biological or clinical markers to be used as screening tools.",Nat Med

Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of AD. Recent studies have indicated that microglial efferocytosis is an important mechanism for clearing apoptotic cells and cellular debris, facilitating the resolution of neuroinflammation. This review summarizes the biological characteristics of microglia and the mechanisms underlying microglial efferocytosis, including the factors and signaling pathways that regulate efferocytosis, the interactions between microglia and other cells that influence this process, and the role of neuroinflammation in AD. Furthermore, we explore the role of microglial efferocytosis in AD from three perspectives: its impact on the clearance of amyloid plaques, its regulation of neuroinflammation, and its effects on neuroprotection. Finally, we summarize the current research status on enhancing microglial efferocytosis to alleviate neuroinflammation and improve AD, as well as the future challenges of this approach as a therapeutic strategy for AD.",J Neuroinflammation

Currently, no radical treatment is available for this disease. Harpagoside is a proposed neuroprotective iridoid active ingredient that can be derived from Scrophulariae buergeriana, Scrophularia striata and Harpagophytum procumbens. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of harpagoside on mitochondrial functions in rotenone-induced cell models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuro-2A (N2A) cells were treated with rotenone to establish in vitro cell models of PD. Cell viability and survival were measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Biochemical assays with spectrophotometry were used to measure complex I activity, mitochondrial swelling and caspase 3 activity. The cell survival rate was first found to be significantly decreased by rotenone (20 nmol/l) treatment. However, intervention with harpagoside (10 µmol/l) was found to increase the cell survival rate of rotenone-induced N2A cell models differentiated with 1 mmol/l of dibutyryl-cAMP. At ≥0.1 µmol/l concentration, harpagoside significantly alleviated rotenone-induced mitochondrial swelling, whereas at 1 µmol/l it significantly counteracted the inhibitory effects of rotenone on complex I activity. At 10 µmol/l harpagoside significantly inhibited rotenone-induced caspase 3 activation. These results suggest that harpagoside has the potential to protect mitochondrial functions against rotenone-induced injury in N2A cell models of PD.",Biomed Rep
40032887,Neuromorphic deviations associated with transcriptomic expression and specific cell type in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be associated with cortical anatomical atrophy and neurodegeneration across various brain regions. However, the relationships between brain structural changes in AD and gene expression remain unclear. We perform the morphometric similarity network (MSN) analysis to reveal the consistent cortical structural differences in individuals with AD compared to controls, and investigate the associations between brain-wide gene expression and morphometric changes. Furthermore, we identify abnormally MSN-related genes linked to specific cell types as the major contributors to transcriptomic relationships. MSN-related structural changes are located in the lateral ventral prefrontal cortex, temporal pole and medial prefrontal lobe, which are highly associated with the AD's cognitive decline. Analysis of gene expression shows the spatial correlations between AD-related genes and MSN differences. Examination of cell type-specific signature genes indicates that changes in microglia and neuronal transcriptional profiles largely contribute to AD-specific MSN differences. The study map the disease-specific structural alterations in AD down to the cellular level, offering a novel perspective on the linking surface-level changes to molecular mechanisms.",Sci Rep
40015475,Amyloid-β oligomers drive amyloid deposit and cascaded tau pathology of Alzheimer's disease in aged brains of non-human primates.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, disproportionately affects the elderly population. While aging is widely recognized as a major risk factor for AD, the precise mechanisms by which aging contributes to the pathogenesis of AD remain poorly understood. In our previous work, the neuropathological changes in the brains of aged cynomolgus monkeys (≥18 years old) following parenchymal cerebral injection of amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) have been characterized. Here, we extend our investigation to middle-aged cynomolgus monkeys (≤15 years old) to establish an AD model. Surprisingly, immunohistochemical analysis reveals no detectable AD-related pathology in the brains of middle-aged monkeys, even after AβOs injection. In a comprehensive pathological analysis of 38 monkeys, we observe that the amyloid-β (Aβ) burden increases significantly with advancing age. Notably, the density of Aβ plaques is markedly higher in the ventral regions compared to the dorsal regions of aged monkey brains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tau phosphorylation coincides with the accumulation of extensive Aβ plaques and exhibits a positive correlation with Aβ burden in aged monkeys. Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of the aged brain in providing the necessary conditions for AβO-induced AD pathologies in cynomolgus monkeys.",J Genet Genomics
40004981,The Potential Role of Phytochemicals in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by memory loss and cognitive disorders. The disease has been related to the presence of so-called senile plaques forming due to the buildup of amyloid β in the hippocampus. The AD therapies developed to date continue to prove insufficient, while long-term exposure to synthetic drugs tends to lead to serious side effects, which is why potential herbal treatments are generally preferable to conventional drug regimens and, as such, have been under considerable research scrutiny in recent years. There are a number of herbs, e.g., lavender Ginkgo biloba, that are already commonly employed in alleviating the symptoms of certain neurological disorders. In light of the above, the aim of the following paper is to discuss the importance of medicinal herbs, their neuroprotective properties, and their mechanisms of activity.

Understanding the impact of aging on striatal glucose metabolism is pivotal in identifying potential biomarkers for the early detection of these disorders.
METHODS: We investigated age-related changes in striatal glucose metabolism using both region of interest (ROI)-based and voxel-wise correlation analyses. Additionally, we employed a normative modeling approach to establish age-related metabolic trajectories and assess individual deviations from these normative patterns. In vivo cerebral glucose metabolism was quantified using a molecular neuroimaging technique, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET.
RESULTS: Our results revealed significant negative correlations between age and glucose metabolism in the bilateral caudate. Furthermore, the normative modeling demonstrated a clear, progressive decline in caudate metabolism with advancing age, and the most pronounced reductions were observed in older individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that metabolic reductions in the caudate may serve as a sensitive biomarker for normal aging and offer valuable insights into the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, by establishing age-specific reference values for caudate glucose metabolism, the normative model provides a framework for detecting deviations from expected metabolic patterns, which may facilitate the early identification of metabolic alterations that could precede clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative processes.",Metabolites
40034533,Cell culture research in aging and Alzheimer's disease: The strategic use/reuse of untreated controls and savings people's tax dollars.,"Cell culture is an essential tool in both fundamental and translational research, particularly for understanding complex diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of cell lines provides the advantage of genetic homogeneity, ensuring reproducible and consistent results. This article explores the application of mammalian cell cultures to model AD, focusing on the transfection of cells with key genes associated with the disease to replicate the cellular environment of AD. It explains various transfection methods and challenges related to the process. These models offer a robust platform for investigating cellular biology, molecular pathways, physiological processes, and drug discovery efforts. A range of assays, including RT-PCR, western blotting, ELISA, mitochondrial respiration, and reactive oxygen species analysis, are employed to assess the impact of genetic modifications on cellular functions and to screen potential AD therapies. Researchers often design experiments with multiple variables such as genetic modifications, chemical treatments, or time points, paired with positive and negative controls. By using a consistent control group across all conditions and under identical experimental conditions, researchers can minimize variability and enhance data reproducibility. This approach is particularly valuable in AD research, where small experimental differences can significantly influence outcomes. Using a shared control group ensures data comparability across experiments, saving time and resources by eliminating redundant control tests. This strategy not only streamlines the research process but also improves the reliability of results, making it a sensible, resource-efficient method that ultimately conserves public funding in the pursuit of AD treatments.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40142948,Emerging Role of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell and Exosome Therapies in Treating Cognitive Impairment.,"Cognitive aging, characterized by the gradual decline in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, significantly impacts daily life. This decline is often accelerated by neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). AD is marked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles, whereas PD involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Both conditions lead to severe cognitive impairment, greatly diminishing the quality of life for affected individuals. Recent advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their derived exosomes as promising therapeutic options. MSCs possess regenerative, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory properties, which can promote neurogenesis, reduce inflammation, and support neuronal health. Exosomes, nanosized vesicles derived from MSCs, provide an efficient means for delivering bioactive molecules across the blood-brain barrier, targeting the underlying pathologies of AD and PD. While these therapies hold great promise, challenges such as variability in MSC sources, optimal dosing, and effective delivery methods need to be addressed for clinical application. The development of robust protocols, along with rigorous clinical trials, is crucial for validating the safety and efficacy of MSC and exosome therapies. Future research should focus on overcoming these barriers, optimizing treatment strategies, and exploring the integration of MSC and exosome therapies with lifestyle interventions. By addressing these challenges, MSC- and exosome-based therapies could offer transformative solutions for improving outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",Pharmaceutics
40071752,High-Throughput Proteoform Imaging for Revealing Spatial-Resolved Changes in Brain Tissues Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Spatially resolved characterization of proteoforms has substantial potential to significantly advance the understanding of physiological and disease mechanisms. However, challenges remain regarding throughput and coverage. A robust method is developed for high-throughput proteoform imaging (HTPi) by combining matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) and region-specific top-down proteomic analysis. MALDI MSI enables the imaging of proteoforms on tissue sections at a rate of 7 h cm<sup>-2</sup> (100-µm spatial resolution), and the identification sensitivity of the proteoforms is improved by narrow-bore monolithic columns with low adsorption, yielding 366 annotated proteoform images from the mouse brain. The obtained proteoform images reveals differential expression of individual proteoforms across the brain regions, and distinct spatial distribution patterns of various proteoforms generated from a single gene. Given its ability to visualize proteoform, HTPi is further applied to explore spatial pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 5 × FAD mice. 158 annotated proteoform images are obtained in hippocampal regions at 50-µm spatial resolution, illuminating 14 differential proteoforms in the subiculum region and highlighting their significant associations with amyloid-β pathology in AD. The results highlight the power of HTPi in unraveling the intricate molecular landscape of brain tissues and its potential in elucidating disease mechanisms.",Adv Sci (Weinh)
40107919,Association of dietary fatty acids with longitudinal change in plasma-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Elevated intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is linked to a reduced risk of dementia in some prospective studies. However, few studies have examined the relationship between nutrient intake and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVES: We explored whether omega-3, omega-6, and monounsaturated fat intakes were associated with changes in plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease over time.
DESIGN: The Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project is a prospective cohort study (1994-2021); the data set used here includes a mean follow-up of 7.0 years.
SETTING: Community-based in New York City.
PARTICIPANTS: 599 dementia-free individuals at baseline who completed a 61-item food frequency questionnaire and had biomarkers measured in plasma from at least two different time points.
MEASUREMENTS: Fatty acid intake tertiles were computed from participant-completed 61-item Willett semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (Channing Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts) obtained once at their baseline visit. Plasma-based biomarker assays were performed, using the single molecule array technology Quanterix Simoa HD-X platform, at baseline and follow-up visits. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models were used to evaluate the association between baseline nutrient intake tertile and changes in biomarkers including phospho-tau181, amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio, phospho-tau181/amyloid-beta42 ratio, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain, and two biomarker patterns derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA1 and PCA2), with higher scores indicating a high level of neurodegeneration and low level of Alzheimer's disease burden, respectively). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and calculated total energy intake initially, and additionally for cerebrovascular risk factors.
RESULTS: Higher baseline omega-3 intake tertile was associated with lesser decline in PCA2 (β = 0.221, p < 0.001) and amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio (β = 0.022, p = 0.003), and a lesser rise in phospho-tau181 (β = -0.037, p = 0.001). Higher omega-6 intake tertile was linked to a lesser rise in phospho-tau181 (β = -0.050, p < 0.001) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (β = -0.028, p = 0.002). Most associations persisted after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher relative baseline intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is associated with lesser progression of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Consuming healthy fatty acids may help prevent accumulation of Alzheimer's disease-related pathological changes.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40100917,Parthenolide regulates microglial and astrocyte function in primary cultures from ALS mice and has neuroprotective effects on primary motor neurons.,"Over the last twenty years, the role of microgliosis and astrocytosis in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases has increasingly been recognized. Dysregulation of microglial and astrocyte properties and function has been described also in the fatal degenerative motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Microglia cells, the immune cells of the nervous system, can either have an immunonegative neurotoxic or immunopositive neuroprotective phenotype. The feverfew plant (Tanacetum parthenium) derived compound parthenolide has been found to be capable of interfering with microglial phenotype and properties. Positive treatment effects were shown in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Now we were able to show that PTL has a modulating effect on primary mouse microglia cells, both wild type and SOD1, causing them to adopt a more neuroprotective potential. Furthermore, we were able to show that PTL, through its positive effect on microglia, also has an indirect positive impact on motor neurons, although PTL itself has no direct effect on these primary motor neurons. The results of our study give reason to consider PTL as a drug candidate for ALS.",PLoS One
40116680,A preliminary study on plasma markers across cognitive stages and links to a history of mild traumatic brain injury.,"Potential implications of a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during aging are understudied. Seven plasma markers were measured in matched participants having normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) with and without a history of mTBI. Phosphorylated tau<sub>181</sub> showed a moderate effect size for being greater in mTBI + individuals having MCI and DAT, and effect sizes for lower amyloid-β 42/40 and higher neurofilament light were seen for mTBI + DAT individuals. This preliminary report shows a potential role of plasma-derived markers in detecting associations between mTBI history and the development of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.",J Alzheimers Dis
40155166,Dual-mode sensing platform based on an iodide ion synergistic covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) for point-of-care testing (POCT) of acetylcholinesterase.,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a critical role in maintaining nervous system homeostasis and coordinating essential biological reactions. AChE is an important biomarker for early diagnosis and treatment, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Therefore, developing efficient and immediate sensing platforms for AChE detection is crucial for advancing early diagnostic tools. In this study, we developed a dual-mode colorimetric/photothermal sensing platform based on iodide ion-synergized covalent porphyrin-triazine backbone nanozymes (Zn-CTF/I) to detect AChE with high sensitivity and reliability. The synergistic interaction between iodide ions and zinc atoms effectively modulated the electronic structure of the catalytic active site, significantly enhancing the peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity of Zn-CTF/I. This enhancement led to a 10-fold reduction in the AChE detection limit compared to controls, with a minimum detection limit of 0.003 U L<sup>-1</sup>, outperforming other reported assays. The integration of temperature-based photothermal signals with colorimetric detection improved the platform's accuracy and reliability. The system also demonstrated excellent recovery performance in detecting AChE in complex serum samples. The proposed dual-mode sensing platform provides a sensitive, reliable, and robust tool for AChE detection, with promising applications in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.",Anal Chim Acta
40086388,Exploring the role of diarylheptanoids derived from turmeric in trapping methylglyoxal with natural deep eutectic solvents.,"Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a reactive carbonyl compound that forms advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are associated with diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Turmeric, which contains bioactive diarylheptanoids, has compounds like curcumin that can trap MGO and inhibit the formation of AGEs. However, diarylheptanoids suffer from poor stability and solubility, complicating their use in standard methods. Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), particularly the BG12-10 % system (betaine and glycerol mixed in a 1:2 ratio with 10 % water added), can improve these properties by enhancing solubility and stability, thus enabling more accurate reaction kinetics. The NADES extract of turmeric can also directly react with MGO, simplifying the experimental process. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry has identified 21 diarylheptanoids in turmeric, 10 of which can trap MGO, curcumin being the only one previously reported in the literature.",Food Chem
40109390,Use of Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities by Medicare Beneficiaries with Dementia.,"Alzheimer's dementia, the most common type of dementia, afflicts more than 6 million Americans. More than 80 percent of people living with dementia (PLWD) live in the community, either with caregivers or alone. As cognitive impairment becomes more severe, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) become more difficult to manage, and those with severe or dangerous BPSD may need to be treated in an inpatient psychiatric facility (IPF). The immediate goal of an IPF stay is to stabilize patients in a psychiatric crisis. IPFs primarily serve people with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, whose care needs may overlap with but also differ from the needs of PLWD. Little is known about PLWD who use IPFs. The goal of this research was to conduct exploratory analyses focused on PLWD who use IPFs to (1) characterize the population and compare them with IPF users without dementia, (2) examine characteristics and utilization patterns for different services and settings that may be associated with IPF stays, and (3) analyze outcomes following IPF stays. The authors used Medicare fee-for-service data to conduct descriptive analyses characterizing beneficiaries with dementia who experienced an IPF stay in 2018 and compare them with beneficiaries without dementia. The research team used regression analyses to explore predictors of IPF use and service use and outcomes after IPF discharge.",Rand Health Q
40012995,Exploring the association between BIN1 gene polymorphisms and hippocampal subfield volume in community mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), crucial for early diagnosis. BIN1, a key AD susceptibility gene after APOE, has higher brain expression in AD and interacts with tau, affecting its pathology. Specific BIN1 SNPs are linked to AD and MCI, but mechanisms are unclear. This study will explore how BIN1 polymorphisms might influence MCI development and correlate with hippocampal integrity in MCI patients using MRI.
METHODS: This study enrolled a total of 52 elderly individuals with MCI and 55 cognitively CN individuals from five communities in Zhongshan Torch Development Zone. Blood samples were collected for analysis of BIN1 rs10200967, rs1060743, and rs4663093 gene polymorphisms, and MRI scans were conducted to assess the volume of hippocampal subregions. The study also seeks to examine the distribution of BIN1 genotypes in both MCI and healthy control populations, as well as to investigate the potential association between BIN1 rs10200967, rs1060743, and rs4663093 genotypes and hippocampal subregion structure in individuals with MCI.
RESULTS: Significant structural atrophy was observed in multiple hippocampal subregions, including left cornu ammonis (lCA), left dentate gyrus (lDG), left hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (lHATA), left subiculum (lSubc), right ornu ammonis (rCA), right dentate gyrus (rDG), right subiculum (rSubc), left entire hippocampus complex (lHIP), and right entire hippocampus complex (rHIP) in seniors with MCI compared to those in the CN (p &lt; 0.05), after adjusting for age, gender, education level, and APOEε4 status. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in left entorhinal cortex (lEC), right entorhinal cortex (rEC), right hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (rHATA), and total intracranial volume (TIV) (p &gt; 0.05). Notably, there were no significant differences in the distribution of BIN1 rs10200967, rs1060743, and rs4663093 genotypes among elderly individuals (p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the association between the BIN1 rs10200967 genotype and lHATA atrophy significant in the MCI after adjusting for age, gender, education level, APOEε4 status, and TIV (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study presents novel findings indicating an association between the BIN1 rs10200967 genotype and lHATA atrophy, with the rs10200967 CC genotype showing a higher volume of lHATA in individuals with MCI. These results suggest that the rs10200967 CC genotype may confer a protective effect against MCI, offering a potential basis for early detection and prevention of AD.",Front Neurol
40134262,"Effect of long-term care and pandemic wave on relative risk of COVID-19-related infection, hospitalization and mortality in people living with dementia: A population-based cohort study.","BackgroundPeople living with dementia (PLWD) are vulnerable to serious COVID-19 illness and death but the contribution of various factors including long-term care (LTC), pandemic wave, hospitalization, comorbidities, and underlying neurological health remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and mortality (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) in PLWD compared to those without dementia, by living circumstance and pandemic wave, while controlling for additional risk factors.MethodsA cohort of people 65 and up with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, was propensity score matched to a control cohort using linked population-level health records. Relative risk of outcomes was estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards modelling. The modifying effects of LTC residence and pandemic wave on all outcomes, and of COVID-19-related hospitalization on COVID-19 mortality were investigated.ResultsCompared to controls without dementia, PLWD had higher risk of infection and COVID-19 mortality whether they lived in LTC or not. For PLWD in LTC, relative risk was often reduced or not significantly different when stratified by wave but remained higher for PLWD not in LTC (32-93%). In LTC, likelihood of hospitalization was 53-64% lower for PLWD compared to those without dementia. PLWD not hospitalized for COVID-19 had higher COVID-19 mortality than non-hospitalized, non-dementia controls both in and not in LTC (32% and 477%, respectively).ConclusionsPLWD repeatedly had higher risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality, but risk varied with changing pandemic circumstances and living environment. Higher mortality may have been associated with reduced hospital transfers, complex care needs and neurological health.",J Alzheimers Dis
40030867,Amyloid-β Deposition Prediction with Large Language Model Driven and Task Oriented Learning of Brain Functional Networks.,"Amyloid-β positron emission tomography can reflect the Amyloid-β protein deposition in the brain and thus serves as one of the golden standards for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. However, its practical cost and high radioactivity hinder its application in large-scale early AD screening. Recent neuroscience studies suggest a strong association between changes in functional connectivity network (FCN) derived from functional MRI (fMRI), and deposition patterns of Amyloid-β protein in the brain. This enables an FCN-based approach to assess the Amyloid-β protein deposition with less expense and radioactivity. However, an effective FCN-based Amyloid-β assessment remains lacking for practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning framework tailored for this task. Our framework comprises three innovative components: 1) a pre-trained Large Language Model Nodal Embedding Encoder, designed to extract task-related features from fMRI signals; 2) a task-oriented Hierarchical-order FCN Learning module, used to enhance the representation of complex correlations among different brain regions for improved prediction of Amyloid-β deposition; and 3) task-feature consistency losses for promoting similarity between predicted and real Amyloid-β values and ensuring effectiveness of predicted Amyloid-β in downstream classification task. Experimental results show superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art FCN-based methods. Additionally, we identify crucial functional sub-networks for predicting Amyloid-β depositions. The proposed method is anticipated to contribute valuable insights into the understanding of mechanisms of AD and its prevention.",IEEE Trans Med Imaging
40026013,Validation of the Cognitive-Emotional Perspective Taking test in patients with neurodegeneration.,"BackgroundTheory of mind (ToM) is crucial for socioemotional interaction. ToM deficits may explain behavioral changes in dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).ObjectiveThis study examined the psychometrics of a new ToM test in healthy adults, identified ToM differences in dementia syndromes, and assessed if ToM scores predict neuropsychiatric function and real-life behavior.MethodsThe UCSF Cognitive and Emotional Perspective Taking Test (CEPT) was evaluated in 195 healthy adults (age: 42.69 ± 16.20) and in a clinic cohort of 304 participants (age: 64.07 ± 9.2). Participants included healthy controls, AD, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), non-fluent PPA (nfvPPA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. CEPT's psychometrics were assessed, and ToM differences and predictions of neuropsychiatric symptoms were analyzed using regression models.ResultsIn controls, CEPT showed good validity and reliability. In patients, CEPT scores correlated with executive and emotional measures, but not language measures, showing good construct validity. Cognitive ToM was most impaired in AD and bvFTD, with less impairment in svPPA and PSP, and all patient groups showed impaired emotional ToM. ToM performance predicted real-life neuropsychiatric behavior, including anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behaviors.ConclusionsToM deficits appear early in dementia syndromes and predict neuropsychiatric behavior. Assessing ToM and social cognition with ecologically valid tasks may help identify altered social cognition in early neurodegeneration.",J Alzheimers Dis

The diagnosis of AD is complex, with the analysis of beta-amyloid and tau in cerebrospinal fluid being a well-established diagnostic approach. However, currently no blood biomarkers have been identified or validated for clinical use. In the present study, we will identify novel plasma biomarkers for AD using our well-established organotypic mouse brain slice model connected to microcontact prints. We hypothesize that AD plasma contains factors that affect endothelial cell migration and new vessel formation.
METHODS: In the present study, plasma from human patients is microcontact printed and connected to mouse brain slices. After 4 weeks in culture, laminin<sup>+</sup> and lectin<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (ECs) and vessels are analyzed by immunostaining techniques. The most promising samples were processed by differential mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Our data show that AD plasma significantly increased the migration length of laminin<sup>+</sup> and lectin<sup>+</sup> ECs along the microcontact prints. Using differential mass spectrometry, we could identify three potential biomarkers: C-reactive protein, basigin, and trem-like transcript 1 protein.

40057462,"The disease burden, risk factors and future predictions of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia in Asia from 1990 to 2021.","BACKGROUND: There is a lack of analysis and prediction of the disease burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) in Asia.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the impact of ADOD on the Asian region during the period from 1990 to 2021.
DESIGN: Data on ADOD in Asia from 1990 to 2021 were collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021. We analyzed the number and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of ADOD from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed, and the average annual percent changes (AAPCs) were calculated to evaluate the trends during this period. Subsequently, an auto - regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction model analysis was conducted to assess the trends in the next 30 years, aiming to report the epidemiology and disease burden of ADOD in Asia.
RESULTS: According to the analysis of the GBD database in 2021, the deaths, DALYs, incidence, and prevalence of ADOD increased by 297.34 %, 249.54 %, 244.73 %, and 250.44 % in Asia from 1990 to 2021. The ASRs of incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs in both males and females, which consistently increased over the study period, showed that the ASRs of all females were consistently higher than those of males in Asia from 1990 to 2021. During the period from 1990 to 2021, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates witnessed the greatest changes in the number of DALYs, incidence, and prevalence. Afghanistan and China had the highest age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) in 2021. It is worth noting that high fasting blood glucose is the top risk factor for the onset of ADOD. Females are more susceptible to the risk factor of high body-mass index (BMI), while males are more likely to be affected by smoking. According to the analysis of the ARIMA prediction model, the disease burden of ADOD in Asia will continue to show an upward trend in the next 30 years.
CONCLUSIONS: We should pay attention to the issue of population aging, attach importance to the intervention measures targeting the risk factors of ADOD, and formulate action plans to address the rising incidence of ADOD.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40011070,A Shift Toward Supercritical Brain Dynamics Predicts Alzheimer's Disease Progression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with continuum of disease progression of increasing severity from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and lastly to AD. The transition from MCI to AD has been linked to brain hypersynchronization, but the underlying mechanisms leading to this are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that excessive excitation in AD disease progression would shift brain dynamics toward supercriticality across an extended regime of critical-like dynamics. In this framework, healthy brain activity during aging preserves operation at near the critical phase transition at balanced excitation-inhibition (E/I). To test this hypothesis, we used source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data from a cross-sectional cohort (N = 343) of individuals with SCD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC) as well as from a longitudinal cohort (N = 45) of MCI patients. We then assessed brain criticality by quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) and functional EI (fE/I) of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were attenuated in SCD in spectrally and anatomically constrained regions while this breakdown was progressively more widespread in MC. In parallel, fE/I was increased in the MCI but not in the SC cohort. Both observations also predicted the disease progression in the longitudinal cohort. Finally, using machine learning trained on functional (LRTCs, fE/I) and structural (MTL volumes) features, we show that LRTCs and f/EI are the most informative features for accurate classification of individuals with SCD while structural changes accurate classify the individuals with MCI. These findings establish that a shift toward supercritical brain dynamics reflects early AD disease progression.",J Neurosci
39976032,Advances in Molecular Docking Techniques for Targeting Protein Misfolding in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, represent a significant global health challenge with limited therapeutic options. Protein misfolding and aggregation, a common pathological hallmark in these disorders, have emerged as promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Molecular docking techniques have played a pivotal role in the identification and design of small molecules that can modulate protein misfolding, offering new hope for effective treatments. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in molecular docking techniques for targeting protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the principles and methodologies behind molecular docking, including various scoring functions and algorithms employed for accurate ligand-protein interactions.

Furthermore, we highlight case studies and success stories where molecular docking has contributed to the discovery of potential drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. These include compounds that inhibit amyloid-β aggregation in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein oligomerisation in Parkinson's disease, and mutant huntingtin aggregation in Huntington's disease. We also discuss the problems and restrictions of molecular docking related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as how to accurately show the flexibility of proteins and why docking results need to be confirmed by experiments. We also discuss the structural biology methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, and how these techniques might help in improving molecular docking studies.",Curr Pharm Biotechnol
40063372,Growth-associated protein 43 is associated with faster functional decline among amyloid-positive individuals with objectively defined subtle cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.,"OBJECTIVE: Objectively defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD) is an emerging classification that may identify individuals at risk for future decline and progression to Alzheimer's disease prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker of synaptic dysfunction, has been shown to relate to an increased risk of converting to dementia, although it is unclear whether GAP-43 alterations may be detected in pre-MCI stages. Therefore, in the present study, we examined CSF GAP-43 levels among individuals with Obj-SCD cross-sectionally and also examined whether baseline GAP-43 predicts future functional decline.
METHOD: Six hundred forty-four participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were divided into six groups based on (a) cognitive status (cognitively unimpaired [CU], Obj-SCD, or MCI) and (b) Aβ status (+ or -).
RESULTS: The CU- group had lower baseline GAP-43 than all Aβ+ groups, but not the other Aβ- groups. Higher GAP-43 levels were associated with faster decline across the entire sample. When moderation by group was examined, higher GAP-43 at baseline predicted faster functional decline for the Obj-SCD+ and MCI+ groups, compared to the CU- group.
CONCLUSIONS: Results extend prior work investigating biomarker associations in Obj-SCD to GAP-43 and show that high baseline CSF GAP-43 is associated with a faster rate of functional decline in Aβ+ individuals who are classified as Obj-SCD or MCI. Importantly, our findings further demonstrate that CSF GAP-43 is associated with early and subtle cognitive changes detectable before the onset of MCI.

40015757,Effect of a single nonpharmacological intervention on cognitive functioning in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Most studies of nonpharmacological interventions have used a combination of medications in experimental and control groups to improve cognitive functioning or to control symptoms, but the results have been inconsistent with respect to the effects of single nonpharmacological interventions on cognitive functioning in older patients with Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a single nonpharmacological intervention on cognitive functioning in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in the first week of January 2024, searching eight electronic databases for articles that reflect on non-pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's disease published between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 2023. All included articles had to be randomized controlled trials. The primary measure was the change in cognitive function before and after the intervention. Data were extracted by two authors and quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook. With the exception of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale [MD=2.99, 95% CI (-0.66,6.63)], the differences between the intervention group and the control group were significant for all the remaining scales, namely, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [SMD=0.65, 95% CI (0.15,1.15)], Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) [MD=-2.30, 95% CI (-3.63,0.97)], Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) [MD=5.03, 95% CI (2.27,7.78)], Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [MD=-2.16, 95% CI (-3.86,0.46)], and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive score (ADAS-cog) [MD=-5.21, 95% CI (-7.89,2.54)]. Subgroup analysis revealed that the most effective intervention was exercise therapy, followed by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. On the other hand, music therapy was not found to be effective. Current evidence suggests that nonpharmacological interventions can be used to improve cognitive functioning in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. This study was registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024497247).",J Prev Alzheimers Dis

Bge Alleviated Neuronal Ferroptosis in Alzheimer's Disease by Regulating the NOX4/Nrf2 Signaling Pathway.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system caused by loss of neuronal or myelin function, accompanied by ferroptosis. Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. (A. membranaceus) is one of China's homologous lists of medicines and food, and its active component saponins have neuroprotective effects. This study examines the mechanism of saponins from A. membranaceus (AS) in treating AD. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analyzed the composition of AS. Ferroptosis models were established to evaluate the anti-AD efficacy. As a result, AS treatment inhibited ferroptosis in SAMP8 mice by restoring iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation (LPO) balance in the brain, thereby improving cognitive impairment and pathological damage. Mechanistically, AS treatment reduced Fe<sup>2+</sup>, MDA, and ROS levels and enhanced protein levels of SLC7A11, GPX4, FTH1, and FPN1. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) overexpression revealed that AS treatment inhibited NOX4, thereby reducing NOX4 stability and regulating the NOX4/Nrf2 pathway in erastin-injured HT22 cells and significantly alleviating ferroptosis. Therefore, AS inhibited ferroptosis and improved AD by rebuilding iron homeostasis and LPO balance in the brain. AS has the potential to be a promising candidate medicine for AD.",J Agric Food Chem
40121258,Effect of PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation on the seeding activity of C-terminal Tau fragments.,"Tau proteins as neurofibrillary tangles are one of the molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and play a central role in tauopathies, a group of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The filament cores from diverse tauopathies share a common region of tau consisting of the R3-R4 microtubule-binding repeats and part of the C-terminal domain, but present a structural polymorphism. Unlike the fibril structure, the PTM signature of tau found in neuronal inclusions, more particularly hyperphosphorylation, is variable between individuals with the same tauopathy, giving rise to diverse strains with different seeding properties that could modulate the aggressiveness of tau pathology. Here, we investigate the conformation, function and seeding activity of two tau fragments and their GSK3β-phosphorylated variants. The R2Ct and R3Ct fragments encompass the aggregation-prone region of tau starting at the R2 and R3 repeats, respectively, and the full C-terminal domain including the PHF-1 epitope (S396, S400, S404), which undergoes a triple phosphorylation upon GSK3β activity. We found that the R3Ct fragment shows both a greater loss of function and pathological activity in seeding of aggregation than the R2Ct fragment which imposes a cross-seeding barrier. PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation induces a local conformational change with a propensity to adopt a β-sheet conformation in the region spanning residues 392-402, and exacerbates the seeding ability of fragments to induce aggregation by overcoming a cross-seeding barrier between tau variants.",Sci Rep
40036435,Disentangled Representation Learning for Capturing Individualized Brain Atrophy via Pseudo-Healthy Synthesis.,"Brain atrophy emerges as a distinctive hallmark in various neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating a progressive trajectory across diverse disease stages and concurrently manifesting in tandem with a discernible decline in cognitive abilities. Understanding the individualized patterns of brain atrophy is critical for precision medicine and the prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is difficult to obtain longitudinal data to compare changes before and after the onset of diseases. In this study, we present a deep disentangled generative model (DDGM) for capturing individualized atrophy patterns via disentangling patient images into ""realistic"" healthy counterfactual images and abnormal residual maps. The proposed DDGM consists of four modules: normal MRI synthesis, residual map synthesis, input reconstruction module, and mutual information neural estimator (MINE). The MINE and adversarial learning strategy together ensure independence between disease-related features and features shared by both disease and healthy controls. In addition, we proposed a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of synthetic pseudo-healthy images, focusing on both their healthiness and subject identity. The results indicated that the proposed DDGM effectively preserves these characteristics in the synthesized pseudo-healthy images, outperforming existing methods. The proposed method demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across two independent datasets from different races and sites. Analysis of the disease residual/saliency maps revealed specific atrophy patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala regions. These accurate individualized atrophy patterns enhance the performance of AD classification tasks, resulting in an improvement in classification accuracy to 92.50 2.70%.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40107340,Methylglyoxal-induced neuronal dysfunction: Linking diabetes to Alzheimer's disease through cytoskeletal disruption.,"This study investigates how methylglyoxal affects Alzheimer's disease, which is common in patients with diabetes mellitus. Using SH-SY5Y cells as a model of AD, we investigated the effects of MGO on cell viability, morphology, inflammation, and stress responses. Exposure to MGO induces cytotoxicity, inflammation and oxidative stress that contribute to AD in diabetic patients. We analyzed how MGO (150-900 μM) affects SH-SY5Y cells and its effects on cell survival, gene expression, cytoskeletal integrity, stress indicators, and Aβ42 accumulation (dose- and time-dependent). MGO dramatically affected cell viability depending on the dose and exposure time. Cell death occurred via intrinsic (BAX, CASP9) and extrinsic (FAS, FASLG) apoptotic pathways. Markers related to insulin signaling such as INSR, IRS1, IRS2, SLC2A4, etc. were downregulated, whereas markers of inflammation such as TNF-α, IL-6 and oxidative markers such as HMOX1, G6PD, etc. were upregulated with MGO (P < 0.001). Changes in MAP2 and TUBB3 expression were associated with cytoskeletal damage (P < 0.01). High levels of Aβ42 and low SOD activity confirmed that oxidative stress was induced. LPS treatment exacerbated these effects (P < 0.01). The results highlight the possible role of MGO in cognitive decline associated with diabetes and suggest the need for novel treatment against MGO-related neurotoxicity.",Eur J Pharmacol
40147601,Ensemble network using oblique coronal MRI for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary degenerative brain disorder commonly found in the elderly, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be considered a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, distinguishing between normal aging and disease-induced neurofunctional impairments is crucial in clinical treatment. Although deep learning methods have been widely applied in Alzheimer's diagnosis, the varying data formats used by different methods limited their clinical applicability. In this study, based on the ADNI dataset and previous clinical diagnostic experience, we propose a method using oblique coronal MRI to assist in diagnosis. We developed an algorithm to extract oblique coronal slices from 3D MRI data and used these slices to train classification networks. To achieve subject-wise classification based on 2D slices, rather than image-wise classification, we employed ensemble learning methods. This approach fused classification results from different modality images or different positions of the same modality images, constructing a more reliable ensemble classification model. The experiments introduced various decision fusion and feature fusion schemes, demonstrating the potential of oblique coronal MRI slices in assisting diagnosis. Notably, the weighted voting from decision fusion strategy trained on oblique coronal slices achieved accuracy rates of 97.5% for CN vs. AD, 100% for CN vs. MCI, and 94.83% for MCI vs. AD across the three classification tasks.",Neuroimage
40143654,Uncovering Amyloid-β Interactions: Gray versus White Matter.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Recent studies suggest that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides interact with cell membranes, potentially catalyzing plaque formation. However, the effect of varying cell membrane compositions on this catalytic process requires further investigation. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that a model gray matter membrane significantly influences the secondary structure of β-amyloid peptides. Notably, residues Asp1 and Glu22 play crucial roles in the membrane interaction. Glutamic acid at position 22, located in the middle of the peptide chain, appears to promote the formation of β-hairpin conformations, which are critical for aggregation. Additionally, our simulations reveal that the model white matter membrane allows a spontaneous insertion of segments of the peptide into the membrane, suggesting that membrane interaction not only alters the peptide structure but may also compromise membrane integrity. Our results show that the different membrane compositions in the brain may play different roles when interacting with β-amyloid peptides.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40095091,Cystatin-c / total cholesterol ratio as a predictor of probable sarcopenia in geriatric population from 12 European countries.,"BACKGROUND: A low handgrip strength (HGS) is associated with several diseases in older adults. However, predictive biomarkers of future low HGS are poorly known. We investigated the prognostic efficacy of the ratio of plasma cystatin-c and total cholesterol (CT ratio) levels for predicting future low HGS in Europe.
METHODS: The data was collected from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) between 2015 and 2021-22. The study participants were geriatric adults aged 50 or above (n = 17,698) from 12 European countries. The baseline data in 2015 included the measurements of CT ratio from participants with normal HGS. The participants who developed low HGS in subsequent years were included. We also investigated the quality of life, difficulties performing daily activities, and several comorbidities in the study population.
RESULTS: In a multivariate-adjusted model, male gender, advancing age, poor quality of life, difficulties performing daily activities, and the presence of depression, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoarthritis were associated with a higher risk of developing low HGS. CT ratio exhibited significant prognostic accuracy for low HGS among men and women aged 60-79, irrespective of the quality of life, degree of depression, difficulties performing daily activities, and the presence of comorbidities, including depression, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoarthritis.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, the CT ratio exhibits adequate prognostic accuracy for low HGS, which is not significantly affected by comorbidities and functional limitations. Our findings have clinical and policy implications in timely identifying older adults at risk of developing low HGS.",Aging Clin Exp Res
40042844,"Physical Activity, Alzheimer Plasma Biomarkers, and Cognition.","IMPORTANCE: Physical activity (PA) is a nonpharmacological intervention for dementia prevention. The association between PA and Alzheimer disease (AD) plasma biomarkers remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations among PA; plasma biomarkers, including β-amyloid 42/40 (Aβ42/40), phosphorylated-tau217 (ptau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL); and cognition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included participants with and without cognitive impairment recruited from multiple memory clinics in South Korea between May 2019 and May 2022. Data were analyzed from June to December 2024.
EXPOSURES: PA was assessed as metabolic equivalent task minutes per week using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and categorized into quartiles from the lowest (Q1) to the highest (Q4).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma Aβ42/40, ptau217, GFAP, and NfL were measured. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).
RESULTS: Among 1144 participants (mean [SD] age 70.9 [8.7] years; 744 [65.0%] female), the highest PA quartile showed significantly lower ptau217 (estimate [SE], -0.14 [0.06]; P = .01) and NfL (estimate [SE], -0.12 [0.05]; P = .01) compared with the lowest quartile. Higher PA quartiles were associated with higher MMSE scores (estimate [SE]: Q2, 0.93 [0.31]; P = .003; Q3, 0.82 [0.32]; P = .009; Q4, 0.94 [0.32]; P = .004) and lower CDR-SB scores (estimate [SE]: Q2, -0.33 [0.16]; P = .04; Q3, -0.37 [0.16]; P = .02; Q4, -0.55 [0.16]; P = .001) after adjusting for age, sex, education years, and β-amyloid uptake. In subgroup analyses according to age and cognitive status, the associations of PA and plasma biomarkers with cognition were more pronounced in the older (age ≥65 years) and cognitively impaired groups compared with the younger and cognitively unimpaired groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that PA may help delay cognitive decline by modulating neurodegeneration and AD-specific tau pathologies. However, the cross-sectional design limits causal inference, and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm and clarify these associations.",JAMA Netw Open
40048331,Fully Hyperbolic Neural Networks: A Novel Approach to Studying Aging Trajectories.,"Characterizing age-related alterations in brain networks is crucial for understanding aging trajectories and identifying deviations indicative of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we developed a Fully Hyperbolic Neural Network (FHNN) to embed functional brain connectivity graphs derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data into low dimensions on a Lorentz model of hyperbolic space. Using this model, we computed hyperbolic embeddings of the MEG brain networks of 587 individuals from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset. Notably, we leveraged a unique metric-the radius of the node embeddings-which effectively captures the hierarchical organization of the brain, to characterize subtle hierarchical organizational changes in various brain subnetworks attributed to the aging process. Our findings revealed that a considerable number of subnetworks exhibited a reduction in hierarchy during aging, with some showing gradual changes and others undergoing rapid transformations in the elderly. Moreover, we demonstrated that hyperbolic features outperform traditional graph-theoretic measures in capturing age-related information in brain networks. Overall, our study represents the first evaluation of hyperbolic embeddings in MEG brain networks for studying aging trajectories, shedding light on critical regions undergoing significant age-related alterations in the large cohort of the Cam-CAN dataset.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40017276,Association of Rapidly Elevated Plasma Tau Protein With Cognitive Decline in Patients With Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Whether elevation in plasma levels of amyloid and tau protein biomarkers are better indicators of cognitive decline than higher baseline levels in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains understudied.
METHODS: We included 67 participants with twice testing for AD-related plasma biomarkers via immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays (amyloid beta [Aβ]1-40, Aβ1-42, total tau [t-Tau], phosphorylated tau [p-Tau] 181, and alpha-synuclein [α-Syn]) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) over a 1-year interval. We examined the correlation between biomarker levels (baseline vs. longitudinal change) and annual changes in the MMSE scores. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to compare the biomarkers.
RESULTS: After adjustment, faster cognitive decline was correlated with lower baseline levels of t-Tau (β=0.332, p=0.030) and p-Tau 181 (β=0.369, p=0.015) and rapid elevation of t-Tau (β=-0.330, p=0.030) and p-Tau 181 levels (β=-0.431, p=0.004). However, the levels (baseline and longitudinal changes) of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and α-Syn were not correlated with cognitive decline. aMCI converters had lower baseline levels of p-Tau 181 (p=0.002) but larger annual changes (p=0.001) than aMCI non-converters. The change in p-Tau 181 levels showed better discriminatory capacity than the change in t-Tau levels in terms of identifying AD conversion in patients with aMCI, with an area under curve of 86.7% versus 72.2%.
CONCLUSION: We found changes in p-Tau 181 levels may be a suitable biomarker for identifying AD conversion.",Psychiatry Investig

39996737,Immune Modulation in Alzheimer's Disease: From Pathogenesis to Immunotherapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia, affecting a significant proportion of the elderly population. AD is characterized by cognitive decline and functional impairments due to pathological hallmarks like amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Microglial activation, chronic neuroinflammation, and disruptions in neuronal communication further exacerbate the disease. Emerging research suggests that immune modulation could play a key role in AD treatment given the significant involvement of neuroinflammatory processes. This review focuses on recent advancements in immunotherapy strategies aimed at modulating immune responses in AD, with a specific emphasis on microglial behavior, amyloid clearance, and tau pathology. By exploring these immunotherapeutic approaches, we aim to provide insights into their potential to alter disease progression and improve patient outcomes, contributing to the evolving landscape of AD treatment.",Cells
39975931,A novel blood-free analytical framework for the quantification of neuroinflammatory load from TSPO PET Imaging.,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is critical for neuroinflammation studies but faces substantial methodological challenges. These include issues with arterial blood sampling for kinetic modeling, the absence of suitable reference regions, genetic polymorphisms affecting tracer affinity, altered blood-to-brain tracer delivery in inflammatory conditions, and high signal variability. This study presents a novel blood-free reference-free method for TSPO PET quantification, leveraging a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of TSPO overexpression across brain regions. Validation was performed on 323 human brain scans from five datasets and three radiotracers. The quantified TSPO topology in healthy controls showed strong concordance with the constitutive TSPO gene expression for all tracers. When using [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 PET data, the method replicated previous findings in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, and XBD173 blocking. However, model extension to [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 and [<sup>11</sup>C]-(R)-PK11195 revealed small effect sizes and high variability, suggesting the need for tracer-specific model optimization. Finally, validation in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation confirmed previous evidence of increased brain TSPO uptake after a systemic challenge. This novel non-invasive method provides individualized TSPO PET quantification, demonstrating broad applicability across TSPO PET tracers and imaging sites, assuming sufficient training data for model development.",Res Sq

Seventy Years of the Nerve Growth Factor: A Potential Novel Treatment in Neurological Diseases?,"Rita Levi-Montalcini's 1953 discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mouse sarcoma tumors marked a groundbreaking moment in neuroscience. NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven. Indeed, its use as a therapeutic agent faces challenges in delivery and clinical translation. This review delves into these challenges, exploring ongoing research on refined delivery methods, dosages, and safety profiles. Innovative strategies, including molecular mimicking, combination therapies, gene therapy, and coupling with neuromodulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation, are discussed. Incorporating nerve growth factor (NGF) into a comprehensive strategy may prove beneficial, particularly in non-neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, trauma, and neuropathies. In these instances, NGF holds promise for promoting tissue regeneration and repair.

Here we synthesized and characterized the Rhy-loaded hyaluronic acid-modified hafnium metal-organic frameworks (HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF). The drug release profiles of free Rhy from HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF were evaluated, and the cellular toxicity was assessed through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. In vivo experiments included behavioral experiments of various murine capabilities, with neuronal damage appraised through Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and Nissl staining. Subsequently, the formation of AD-related amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques formation and Tau phosphorylation were measured. The HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF with spherical shape were presented as uniformly dispersed and with a negative charge, exhibiting a pronounced pharmacological sustained-release effect and minimal cellular toxicity. Findings from the Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and elevated plus maze test substantiated that HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF effectively mitigated cognitive deficiency and anxiety, and enhanced spatial learning in AD mice. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot both illustrated that HA@Rhy@Hf-MOF could attenuate hippocampal Aβ formation and deposition, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation.

40034365,A systematic study of molecular targets of cannabidiol in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent, incurable, and chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), disrupting various bodily systems. Despite the lack of a cure, phenolic compounds like cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for AD.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the impact of different types of cannabidiol on AD, unveiling their neuroprotective mechanisms.
METHODS: The research used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with keywords like ""Alzheimer's disease"" and ""Cannabidiol.""

By training on data from healthy controls, DNT learns the normative distribution of tract data, and can delineate along-tract micro- and macro-structural abnormalities. Leveraging a large sample size via generative pre-training, we assess DNT's generalizability using transfer learning on data from an independent cohort acquired in India. Our findings demonstrate DNT's capacity to detect widespread diffusivity abnormalities along tracts in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, aligning closely with results from the Bundle Analytics (BUAN) tractometry pipeline.

39989971,Systems-Level Interactome Mapping Reveals Actionable Protein Network Dysregulation Across the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses as a continuum, from preclinical stages to late-stage cognitive decline, yet the molecular mechanisms driving this progression remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a systems-level map of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network dysfunction across the AD spectrum and uncover epichaperomes-stable scaffolding platforms formed by chaperones and co-factors-as central drivers of this process. Using over 100 human brain specimens, mouse models, and human neurons, we show that epichaperomes emerge early, even in preclinical AD, and progressively disrupt multiple PPI networks critical for synaptic function and neuroplasticity. Glutamatergic neurons, essential for learning and memory, exhibit heightened vulnerability, with their dysfunction driven by protein sequestration into epichaperome scaffolds, independent of changes in protein expression. Notably, pharmacological disruption of epichaperomes with PU-AD restores PPI network integrity and reverses synaptic and cognitive deficits, directly linking epichaperome-driven network dysfunction to AD pathology. These findings establish epichaperomes as key mediators of molecular collapse in AD and identify network-centric intervention strategies as a promising avenue for disease-modifying therapies.",Res Sq
39994624,UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS and network pharmacology analyses to investigate the mechanism by which Danggui-Shaoyao-San affects 27-OHC-induced cell damage in SH-SY5Y/C6 coculture.,"BACKGROUND: Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) is a classic Chinese medicine formula that has been extensively studied for its efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its mechanism of action is still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS was used to analyze and identify the compounds in DSS. Network pharmacology was used to analyze the common targets of drug-containing serum chemistries and AD, as well as the AD pathways in which drug-containing serum chemistries may be involved. The 27-OHC-induced SH-SY5Y/C6 coculture cell injury model was used to explore the mechanism of action of DSS in the treatment of AD.
RESULTS: UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS analysis identified 73 chemical constituents in DSS aqueous extract and 39 compounds in drug-containing serum. According to network pharmacology analysis, DSS and AD share 181 common targets, with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) being the main effective targets. Furthermore, DSS may treat AD through the modulation of lipid metabolism-related pathways and the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway. 27-hydroxycholesterol acid (27-OHC) significantly reduced the viability of SH-SY5Y cells and C6 cells in vitro, while DSS administration upregulated the expression of cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) and cytochrome P450 7B1 (CYP7B1) enzymes and reduced cholesterol levels in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, DSS decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and increased glutathione (GSH) levels in coculture systems. DSS downregulated the expression of IL-17 in 27-OHC-injured SH-SY5Y cells and downregulated the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in 27-OHC-injured C6 cells.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the effective components, targets and mechanisms of DSS in the treatment of AD, highlighting the significant potential of DSS in treating this disease.",BMC Complement Med Ther
40122104,Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel 18F-labeled Oxadiazole-based Positron Emission Tomography Tracers for β-Amyloid.,"This research details the synthesis, structure-activity evaluation, and analysis of novel oxadiazole-based compounds for visualizing β-amyloid (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The derivatives exhibited binding affinities to Aβ aggregates in vitro. The [18F]-labeled compounds, [18F]4-(5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N, N-dimethylaniline (compound [18F] 3) and [18F] 4-(5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N-methylaniline (compound [18F]4), effectively labeled Aβ plaques in brain sections from Alzheimer's disease patients and APP/PS1 mice. In dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies on healthy mice, these compounds demonstrated favorable brain uptake followed by clearance. Additional structural alterations to compounds [18F] 3 and [18F] 4 may lead to the development of more efficient PET tracers for precise visualization of Aβ plaques.",Radiat Res
40034321,Endogenous extraction yielded high quality sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts unveils potent antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer's activities.,"The extraction of sulforaphane (SFN) is challenging due to its instability and low water solubility, with existing methods often involving toxic solvents or yielding low SFN. We optimized an endogenous extraction protocol for high SFN content, characterized by HPLC and LC-MS analyses. SFN remained stable in refrigerated broccoli sprout extract powder (BSEP) for over a month. BSEP showed four times higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) than the SFN standard, indicating high antioxidant capacity. It also reduced inflammatory responses by down-regulating COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α gene expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Additionally, BSEP exhibited neuroprotective properties in amyloid-beta (1-42) (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, enhancing memory and learning retention in water maze and passive avoidance tests. BSEP mitigated spatial cognitive impairment and improved memory function in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced memory-deficient mice. While BSEP did not alter acetylcholine (ACh) concentration, it improved memory and learning by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. BSEP with SFN content exceeding 200 mg/kg ameliorated neurobehavioral deficits and protected the brain from amyloid deposition, suggesting its therapeutic potential in AD treatment. We propose an eco-friendly form of SFN-rich BSEP for daily intake and commercial therapeutics.",Heliyon

The exact mechanisms and timeline through which APOE/PICALM influence brain functions and contribute to LOAD remain unidentified. This includes their effects on individuals prior to the development of the disease.ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of APOE and PICALM risk genes on brain health and function in non-demented individuals. This study aims to differentiate the combined risk effects of both genes from the risk associated solely with APOE, and to examine how PICALM alleles influence the risk linked to APOE.MethodsAPOE/PICALM alleles were assessed to determine the genetic risk of LOAD in 79 healthy, middle-aged participants who underwent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. The resting-state signal was analyzed to estimate relative spectral power, complexity (Higuchi's algorithm), and connectivity (coherence in EEG and independent component analysis-based connectivity in fMRI).ResultsThe main findings indicated that individuals at risk for LOAD exhibited reduced signal complexity and the so-called ""slowing of EEG"" which are well-known EEG markers of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, these individuals showed altered functional connectivity in fMRI (within attention-related areas).ConclusionsRisk alleles of APOE/PICALM may affect brain integrity and function prior to the clinical onset of the disease.",J Alzheimers Dis
40017059,Prevalence and risk of cognitive impairment among patients with asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Asthma, a prevalent chronic respiratory condition, is hypothesized to influence cognitive health; however, the precise nature of this association remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the prevalence and risk of cognitive impairment in individuals with asthma.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, spanning publications up to December 25, 2023. This search aimed to identify studies that assessed cognitive impairment in patients with asthma. We used the random effects model in the R v4.3 software for the meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and risk of cognitive decline, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease, among asthma patients. To ensure robustness and validity, the quality of the studies was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, of these 10 were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients with asthma was 16.3%. The analysis also revealed an increased hazard ratio of 1.47 (95% confidence interval [1.09; 1.84]) for cognitive impairment in patients with asthma compared to the control group (individuals without asthma). Significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed across the studies. The results underscored the substantial correlation between asthma and heightened risks of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: This review found a notable association between asthma and an increased risk of cognitive decline, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive health assessments into asthma care. Further research is required to understand this relationship and develop effective treatments. Emphasizing a holistic approach to asthma management, these findings highlight the need to consider both respiratory and cognitive health for comprehensive patient care.",Brain Behav
40149482,Curious Dichotomies of Apolipoprotein E Function in Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer-One Explanatory Mechanism of Inverse Disease Associations?,"An apparent ""inverse"" relationship exists between two seemingly unconnected conditions, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer, despite sharing similar risk factors, like increased age and obesity. AD is associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles that cause neural degeneration; cancer, in contrast, is characterized by enhanced cell survival and proliferation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the main lipoprotein found in the central nervous system and via its high affinity with lipoprotein receptors plays a critical role in cholesterol transport and uptake. ApoE has 3 protein isoforms, ApoE E2, ApoE E3, and ApoE E4, respectively encoded for by 3 allelic variants of APOE (ε2, ε3, and ε4). This review examines the characteristics and function of ApoE described in both AD and cancer to assimilate evidence for its potential contribution to mechanisms that may underly the reported inverse association between the two conditions. Of the genetic risk factors relevant to most cases of AD, the most well-known with the strongest contribution to risk is APOE, specifically the ε4 variant, whereas for cancer risk, APOE has not featured as a significant genetic contributor to risk. However, at the protein level in both conditions, ApoE contributes to disease pathology via affecting lipid physiology and transport. In AD, Aβ-dependent and -independent interactions have been suggested, whereas in cancer, ApoE plays a role in immunoregulation. Understanding the mechanism of action of ApoE in these diametrically opposed diseases may enable differential targeting of therapeutics to provide a beneficial outcome for both.",Genes (Basel)
40034350,Astrocyte dysfunction alters GABAergic communication and ammonia metabolism in the streptozotocin-induced sporadic Alzheimer's disease model.,"BACKGROUND: In the sporadic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) administration, cognitive impairment is accompanied by specific astrocytic changes in the hippocampus prior to amyloid deposition.
OBJECTIVE: Hypothesizing that the synthesis of GABA, via MAO-B, contributes to ammonia elevation, thereby compromising antioxidant defense and ATP synthesis, and possibly contributing to cognitive damage, we determined the hippocampal levels of glutamine synthetase (GS), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and other enzymes related to GABA metabolism.
METHODS: Immunoblotting and RT-PCR assays were carried out in hippocampal samples of Wistar rats, at 4 and 16 weeks post-STZ, in the sporadic STZ-induced AD model, corresponding to the pre-amyloid and amyloid phases, respectively.
RESULTS: We observed a reduction in GS activity and increased MAO-B content, both in 4 weeks and in 16 weeks, reinforcing the idea that astroglial dysfunction precedes the amyloid phase. These alterations were accompanied by an increase in the content of ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), which catalyzes the synthesis of putrescine (substrate for GABA synthesis, via MAO-B), and a reduction in the gene expression of arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of creatine, and in the generation of GABA agonists. These changes were only seen in the amyloid phase of the AD model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to explain the greater damage that occurs in energy metabolism at this stage, in addition to the greater GABAergic loss. The changes reinforce the importance of the STZ model and further our understanding of the changes in both AD phases.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40144222,Exploring shared therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma using network pharmacology and protein-protein interaction approach.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM) are complex neurological disorders with distinct pathologies but overlapping molecular mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated signaling pathways. Despite significant advancements in research, effective therapies targeting both conditions remain elusive. Identifying shared molecular targets and potential therapeutic agents could offer novel treatment strategies for these disorders.
METHODOLOGY: The study employs an integrative network pharmacology approach to explore the therapeutic potential of bioactive compounds from Eclipta alba, a medicinal herb known for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. A systematic methodology was adopted, starting with network pharmacology analysis using STRING and DisGeNET databases, which identified 617 common genes associated with AD and GBM. Among these, key hub genes-TP53, STAT3, AKT1, and IL6-were prioritized using Cytoscape for network visualization and analysis.
RESULTS: Molecular docking studies were conducted using PyRx software to assess the binding interactions of 26 phytochemicals from Eclipta alba against the identified target genes. Luteolin exhibited the highest binding affinity to IL6 (-7.8 kcal/mol), forming stable hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. To further validate this interaction, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed using GROMACS, confirming the stability of the Luteolin-IL6 complex. Additionally, MM-PBSA binding energy calculations using AmberTools (-145.44 kJ/mol) provided further evidence of a strong and stable interaction. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity evaluations, conducted using SwissADME and pkCSM, highlighted luteolin's favorable drug-like properties, including good bioavailability and low toxicity. These findings suggest that luteolin may serve as a promising multi-target therapeutic agent for AD and GBM by modulating key pathological pathways.
CONCLUSION: The present study provides a strong computational foundation for further in vitro and in vivo validation. The results highlight the potential of luteolin in developing dual-target treatment strategies for neurodegenerative and oncological disorders, offering new avenues for therapeutic advancements.",Front Chem
40148603,Ceramide: a central regulator in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"Ceramide is a key component of sphingolipid metabolism and functions as a lipid second messenger. Sphingolipids are crucial for maintaining the nervous system, particularly in differentiation and development. Ceramide supports hippocampal growth but, at elevated levels, can impair dendritic cell function. During aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), intracellular ceramide production and accumulation increase, negatively impacting cognitive functions. High ceramide levels are linked to the progression of AD pathology, significantly contributing to amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation, tau tangle formation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Ceramide facilitates the production and aggregation of Aβ peptides, leading to neurotoxic plaque formation. Its dysregulation is associated with abnormal tau protein phosphorylation, resulting in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition, elevated ceramide levels can trigger brain inflammation by promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activating microglia. This accumulation also enhances oxidative stress in neurons, damaging cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. This review will help in deeper understanding of the molecular pathways altered via ceramide metabolism and accumulation involved in the AD pathology. The cellular and pathological mechanisms of ceramide and their impact on Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. A deeper understanding of ceramide-mediated effects in aging and AD could pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting ceramide metabolism to treat neurodegenerative diseases and age-related cognitive decline.",Inflammopharmacology
40046332,Enlarged cavum septum pellucidum as a neuroimaging signature of head impact exposure.,"Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is commonly observed upon neuroimaging examination in individuals exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and post-mortem in cases with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Consequently, CSP has been proposed as a potential biomarker for RHI-related neurodegeneration, yet prevalence estimates of CSP across other neurodegenerative diseases and its clinical implications are largely unknown. We assessed CSP prevalence and clinical correlates in individuals with RHI exposure, a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neurodegenerative disease (i.e. Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia) and normal cognition. The primary group of interest, i.e. individuals exposed to RHI in contact sports or military service (n = 65; mean exposure 21.58 years), was compared against age- and sex-matched participants with TBI (n = 57; number of TBI range: 1-5) and non-exposed participants of the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (Alzheimer's disease, n = 30; frontotemporal dementia, n = 24; normal cognition, n = 27). Structural 3D brain MRI scans were visually rated for CSP grade (ranging 0-4) by two raters blinded to the clinical information. A CSP of at least Grade 2 was considered enlarged/abnormal. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohens' weighted Kappa (κ). We investigated whether prevalence of enlarged CSP differed between groups and assessed associations with neuropsychological outcomes (verbal memory, processing speed, mental flexibility and semantic fluency), neuropsychiatric symptoms (neuropsychiatric inventory), ventricular enlargement as measured with Evan's index and MRI volumes of composite regions (limbic, temporal-meta regions and the whole brain). Inter-rater reliability was substantial [κ = 0.734 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.80)]. An enlarged CSP was more often observed in the RHI group (44.6%) compared with individuals with Alzheimer's disease [13.3%, odds ratio (OR) = 5.24 (1.79-19.26)], frontotemporal dementia [16.7%, OR = 4.03 (1.35-15.02)] and normal cognition [18.5%, OR = 3.54 (1.27-11.62)], all P <sub>FDR</sub> &lt; 0.05, but not compared with the TBI group [29.8%, OR = 1.90 (0.90-4.06), P <sub>FDR</sub>  = 0.094]. In those with RHI, enlarged CSP was associated with lower outcomes on verbal memory learning (η² = 0.09, P <sub>FDR</sub> = 0.023) and recall (η² = 0.08, P <sub>FDR</sub> = 0.030). For TBI, enlarged CSP was associated with lower performance on verbal memory learning; however, this lost significance after multiple comparison correction (η² = 0.014, P <sub>FDR</sub> = 0.09). Enlarged CSP was not associated with the composite MRI volumes, ventricular enlargement or neuropsychiatric symptoms. In summary, enlarged CSP was more prevalent in RHI-exposed individuals compared with individuals with a neurodegenerative disease or normal cognition, but not compared with TBI, and was associated with lower verbal memory performance in the RHI group. Our study highlights enlarged CSP as a potential consequence of long-term head impact exposure and, to a lesser extent, TBI, rather than a general consequence of neurodegeneration.",Brain Commun
39994083,The Inner Ear and Aging Brain: A Cross-Sectional Study of Vestibular Function and Morphometric Variations in the Entorhinal and Trans-Entorhinal Cortex.,"PURPOSE: While the vestibular system is crucial for balance, posture, and stable vision, emerging evidence connects vestibular loss in older adults to spatial cognitive deficits. However, the specific neural pathways remain unclear. This study examines morphometric changes in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and trans-entorhinal cortex (TEC), key regions in the vestibular spatial cognitive network, with vestibular function.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used T1-weighted MRI images and vestibular physiological data from 103 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants (74 males and 29 females). Vestibular function was assessed through the cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), ocular VEMP (oVEMP), and video head-impulse test (vHIT), examining both categorical presence/absence of responses and continuous measures (cVEMP amplitude, oVEMP amplitude, and VOR gain). Morphometric changes in the ERC and TEC were analyzed by examining surface expansions and contractions relative to average shapes.
RESULTS: Reduced saccular function correlated with surface expansion in the left ERC's pro-rhinal, right ERC's intermediate caudal and superior regions, and right TEC's sulcal region. The decreased utricular function was associated with surface contraction in the left lateral TEC, left ERC's anterior sulcal and trans-entorhinal regions, and surface expansion in the lateral region of the left ERC. Reduced canal function showed surface contraction in the right ERC's pro-rhinal and lateral regions and the right TEC's posterior sulcal and trans-entorhinal regions.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the intricate link between vestibular function and ERC/TEC morphology, emphasizing their role in spatial and cognitive abilities. Future research will assess if structural changes due to vestibular loss contribute to cognitive deficits in aging and Alzheimer's disease.",J Assoc Res Otolaryngol
40129145,Deciphering T Cell Dynamics in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: Insights and Implications.,"Neuroinflammation has emerged as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), paving the way for promising therapeutic interventions. Increasing evidence highlights the interplay between the peripheral immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) in driving neuroinflammation, with T lymphocytes playing a vital role in both regulatory and effector functions. Aberrant activation of T cells during the early stages of neuroinflammation perpetuates inflammatory responses by interacting with CNS glial cells and releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17. Studies have documented significant T cell activation and infiltration into the brain parenchyma in AD, contributing to disease progression. However, the specific mechanisms by which T cells mediate AD pathogenesis remain unclear. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current understanding of T cell involvement in AD pathology, emphasizing their aberrant activation, interactions with microglia, tau protein pathology, and the influence of gut microbiota. Finally, we propose potential treatment modalities for AD, highlighting the promise of T cellbased therapies currently under investigation in clinical trials. Understanding the critical role of T cells in intercellular communication and disease progression may enhance our comprehension of the pathophysiology of AD.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40143166,Oxytocin Protects PC12 Cells Against β-Amyloid-Induced Cell Injury.,"Background/Objectives: Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by progressive cognitive decline and non-cognitive symptoms that significantly affect health and quality of life. Beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein accumulation is a key factor in AD pathology, leading to neuronal damage. Oxytocin (OXT), a neuropeptide with neuroprotective potential, has garnered interest owing to its ability to mitigate neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that oxytocin could protect PC12 cells from Aβ-induced cytotoxicity through antioxidant effects and modulation of apoptotic pathways (i.e., mitochondrial and MAPK pathways). In this study, we aim to assess oxytocin's protective effects on cell viability, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and apoptotic signaling. Methods: PC12 cells were treated with Aβ25-35 and pre-treated with varying oxytocin concentrations to assess cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blotting was performed to analyze the effects on mitochondrial apoptosis and MAPK pathways. Results: Oxytocin treatment significantly improved cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and reduced Aβ-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Oxytocin-treated groups exhibited decreased ROS levels, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and modulation of apoptosis-related proteins. Oxytocin upregulated phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 while downregulating BAX and caspase-3, reducing the BAX/Bcl-2 ratio. Conclusions: Oxytocin effectively protects PC12 cells from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. Further research is needed to clarify oxytocin's mechanisms and clinical implications in AD treatment.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel)
40163795,"Grief and Economic Stressors by Sex, Gender, and Education: Associations With Alzheimer Disease-Related Outcomes.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence and impact of stressful life events (SLEs) on age-related and Alzheimer disease (AD)-related pathways may depend on social determinants including gender and education. We investigated whether specific SLEs are associated with AD pathology and neurodegeneration and how these associations differ by gender and education.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included cognitively unimpaired participants, most with a family history of sporadic AD, from the ALzheimer's and FAmilies (ALFA) cohort, based in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had available assessments on occurrence and type of lifetime SLEs and lumbar puncture and/or structural MRI. We performed multiple regression analyses to examine the associations of specific SLE type with (1) AD pathologies (CSF phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181] and β-amyloid [Aβ] 42/40) and (2) neurodegeneration markers (CSF neurogranin and GM volumes voxel-wise) including interaction and stratification analyses by gender (women/men) and education.
RESULTS: In total, 1,290 cognitively unimpaired participants (mean age = 59.4 years, range: 48-77 years, 99% White participants, 61% women) were included (393 with lumbar puncture and 1,234 with spectroscopic MRI assessments). Less educated participants and women reported more grief-related and economic-related SLEs. Furthermore, women reported more abuse and reproductive SLEs. Grief-related SLEs were associated with AD and neurodegeneration CSF outcomes while economic SLEs were associated with MRI-based GM outcomes, both in an age-independent manner. Specifically, partner's death was associated with lower Aβ42/40 (B = -5.19; 95% CI -9.61 to -0.76; p = 0.022) and higher p-tau181 (B = 0.18; 95% CI 0.05-0.32; p = 0.007) and neurogranin (B = 0.19; 95% CI 0.05-0.32; p = 0.007). The associations with Aβ42/40 were driven by less educated participants and men and associations with p-tau181 and neurogranin driven by women. Unemployment and economic loss were associated with lower GM volumes in limbic and frontal areas, driven by more educated participants and men and by women, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Older adults at risk of cognitive decline with less education and women may be more susceptible to experience more SLEs. Men who have experienced widowhood and unemployment and women who have experienced financial difficulties may benefit from interventions.",Neurology

40014571,S-Nitrosylation of CRTC1 in Alzheimer's disease impairs CREB-dependent gene expression induced by neuronal activity.,"cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and long-term memory formation through the regulation of neuronal activity-dependent gene expression, and CRTC1 dysregulation is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that increased S-nitrosylation of CRTC1 (forming SNO-CRTC1), as seen in cell-based, animal-based, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebrocortical neuron-based AD models, disrupts its binding with CREB and diminishes the activity-dependent gene expression mediated by the CRTC1/CREB pathway. We identified Cys216 of CRTC1 as the primary target of S-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO)-related species. Using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we mutated Cys216 to Ala in hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons bearing one allele of the APP<sup>Swe</sup> mutation (AD-hiPSC neurons). Introduction of this nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 mutant rescued defects in AD-hiPSC neurons, including decreased neurite length and increased neuronal cell death. Additionally, expression of nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 in vivo in the hippocampus rescued synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that formation of SNO-CRTC1 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by attenuating the neuronal activity-dependent CREB transcriptional pathway, and suggests a therapeutic target for AD.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
40096963,"Potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease: Fibroblast growth factors and their regulation of ferroptosis, pyroptosis and autophagy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively worsening neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain and the abnormal aggregation of tau protein forming neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological changes lead to impaired neuronal function and cell death, subsequently affecting the structure and function of the brain. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a group of proteins that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This article reviews the expression and regulation of FGFs in the central nervous system and how they affect neuronal survival, as well as the changes in FGF signaling pathways and its regulation of programmed cell death in AD. It particularly focuses on the impact of FGF1, FGF2, FGF21, other members of the FGF family, and FGFR on the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. The potential of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB signaling pathways as targets for AD treatment is also discussed. Furthermore, the relationship between FGF-regulated ferroptosis, Pyroptosis and Autophagy and AD is explored, along with the role of these mechanisms in improving the progression of AD.",Neuroscience
40047958,Blood phosphorylated Tau217 distinguishes amyloid-positive from amyloid-negative subjects in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, and cost-effective tools to detect amyloid pathology are urgently needed. Blood-based Tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (pTau217) seems promising, but its reliability as a proxy for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) status and ability to identify patients within the AD spectrum remain unclear.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the potential of blood pTau217 to differentiate amyloid-positive (A+) and amyloid-negative (A-) subjects. We included original studies reporting quantitative data on pTau217 concentrations in both blood and CSF in the AD continuum. The single-group meta-analysis computed the pooled pTau217 levels in blood and in CSF, separately in the A+ and A- groups, while the head-to-head meta-analysis compared the mean pTau217 concentrations in the A+ versus A- subjects, both in blood and CSF, stratifying by assessment method in both cases.
RESULTS: Ten studies (819 A+; 1055 A-) were included. The mean pTau217 levels resulted higher in CSF than in blood and, crucially, in A+ individuals than in A- ones, regardless of the laboratory method employed. Most importantly, all laboratory techniques reliably distinguished A+ from A- subjects, whether applied to CSF or blood samples.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that blood-based pTau217 is a reliable marker of amyloid pathology with significant implications for clinical practice in the AD continuum. Indeed, pTau217 might be a non-invasive, scalable biomarker for early AD detection, reducing the reliance on more invasive, expansive, and less accessible methods.

40156002,Klotho overexpression protects human cortical neurons from β-amyloid induced neuronal toxicity.,"Klotho, a well-known aging suppressor protein, has been implicated in neuroprotection and the regulation of neuronal senescence. While previous studies have demonstrated its anti-aging properties in human brain organoids, its potential to mitigate neurodegenerative processes triggered by β-amyloid remains underexplored. In this study, we utilised human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered with a doxycycline-inducible system to overexpress KLOTHO and generated 2D cortical neuron cultures from these cells. These neurons were next exposed to pre-aggregated β-amyloid 1-42 oligomers to model the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our data reveal that upregulation of KLOTHO significantly reduced β-amyloid-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression and preservation of axonal integrity. Additionally, KLOTHO overexpression prevented the loss of dendritic branching and mitigated reductions in axonal diameter, hallmark features of neurodegenerative pathology. These results highlight Klotho's protective role against β-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in human cortical neurons and suggest that its age-related decline may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of Klotho-based interventions in mitigating age-associated neurodegenerative processes.",Mol Brain
40017668,Trends of the Dementia Burden in South Asia: An Analysis of 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze the trends in the burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias (ADoD) in South Asia from 1990 to 2021, focusing on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The objective is to identify key risk factors, such as metabolic and behavioral health risks, and assess regional variations in the burden of ADoD across five South Asian countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 report were analyzed using descriptive statistics and join point regression analysis. The analysis evaluated trends in ADoD incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs across five South Asian countries, focusing on health risk factors, including high body mass index, behavioral and metabolic risks.
RESULTS: A slight decrease in incidence rates from 80.57 to 79 per 100,000 was observed, alongside a significant increase in mortality rates from 14.11 to 17.2 per 100,000. While prevalence rates experienced a minor decline, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rose from 272.02 to 308.27 per 100,000, reflecting an increasing burden of the disease. Notably, Nepal significantly reduced its incidence rates, while Pakistan saw an increase in mortality rates. In South Asia, the highest-ranking risk factor is metabolic risks, followed by high fasting plasma glucose (FPG).
CONCLUSIONS: The growing burden of ADoD in South Asia necessitates targeted public health strategies addressing key risk factors, with metabolic health risks being a primary contributor. Public health interventions should focus on the most affected populations, particularly the elderly and females, to mitigate the increasing impact of dementia across the region.",Aging Med (Milton)
40039485,Revealing Alzheimer's Disease Dementia Patterns in [18F]Florbetapir PET with Independent Component Analysis.,"This study investigates Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia through [18F]Florbetapir ([18F]FBP) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. We employ Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify shared latent patterns across controls and individuals with Dementia.

After visual inspection, nine independent components (IC) were selected, including visual, salience, default mode, cerebellum, left and right temporal, motor, frontal, and subcortical/brainstem. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analysis was performed on the IC weights to evaluate group differences. Salience, default mode, left and right temporal, and frontal components displayed a significant group effect with increased weights in the AD dementia group. Notably, the salience and frontal components demonstrated a significant interaction effect of diagnosis with age.

40037468,"2024 VCP International Conference: Exploring multi-disciplinary approaches from basic science of valosin containing protein, an AAA+ ATPase protein, to the therapeutic advancement for VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathy.","Valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) is a ubiquitously expressed AAA+ ATPase associated with numerous protein-protein interactions and critical cellular functions including protein degradation and clearance, mitochondrial homeostasis, DNA repair and replication, cell cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, and lysosomal functions including autophagy and apoptosis. Autosomal-dominant missense mutations in the VCP gene may result in VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathy (VCP-MSP), a rare degenerative disorder linked to heterogeneous phenotypes including inclusion body myopathy (IBM) with Paget's disease of bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or IBMPFD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), parkinsonism, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT), and spastic paraplegia. The complexity of VCP-MSP makes collaboration among stakeholders essential and necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach. The 2024 VCP International Conference was hosted at Caltech between February 22 and 25. Co-organized by Cure VCP Disease and Dr. Tsui-Fen Chou, the meeting aimed to center the patient as a research partner, harmonize diverse stakeholder engagement, and bridge the gap between basic and clinical neuroscience as it relates to VCP-MSP. Over 100 multi-disciplinary experts attended, ranging from basic scientists to clinicians to patient advocates. Attendees discussed genetics and clinical presentation, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying disease, therapeutic approaches, and strategies for future VCP research. The conference included three roundtable discussions, 29 scientific presentations, 32 scientific posters, nine patient and caregiver posters, and a closing discussion forum. The following conference proceedings summarize these sessions, highlighting both the identified gaps in knowledge and the significant strides made towards understanding and treating VCP diseases.",Neurobiol Dis
40096896,Chronic stress leads to earlier cognitive decline in an Alzheimer's mouse model: The role of neuroinflammation and TrkB.,"While most Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies focus on the cognitive aspects of the disease, less focus is given to affective symptoms. In this study, we investigated the long-term consequences of exposure to chronic stress. 5xFAD AD model mice were exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress, and cognitive and emotional aspects were examined at 3-time points (up to 4 months after exposure to stress). We found that exposure to chronic stress accelerates neuropathology outcomes in the 5xFAD mouse model in adulthood, accompanied by changes in the neurotrophic system. Specifically, we found that chronic stress accelerated the appearance of short-term spatial memory deficits in the 5xFAD mice and decreased tyrosine kinase B full receptor (TrkB.FL) expression levels. In vitro, we showed that corticosterone impairs the ability of microglia to uptake Aβ and reduces microglial activation. To conclude, our study may shed light on the mechanisms through which mild chronic stress might contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms.",Brain Behav Immun
40043469,CSF α-synuclein aggregation is associated with APOE ε4 and progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"At autopsy, around half of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibit Lewy body pathology, and the main component of Lewy body pathology is α-synuclein aggregates. This study investigated the prevalence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein aggregation and its association with demographic factors and cognitive decline among 1619 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with the test for α-synuclein aggregation by seed amplification assay (SAA). This cohort consisted of 595 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 765 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 259 with AD dementia. The results showed a higher prevalence of positive α-synuclein aggregation status in the AD dementia group (37.07 %) and the MCI group (22.75 %) compared to CN controls (16.13 %). Additionally, APOE ε4 carriers exhibited a higher prevalence of α-synuclein aggregation compared to non-carriers: 20.12 % for APOE ε4-/- (non-carriers), 24.82 % for APOE ε4 + /-, and 30.92 % for APOE ε4 + /+ . Longitudinally, positive CSF α-synuclein aggregation associated with accelerated cognitive decline, especially in the MCI and AD groups. Notably, positive aggregation status did not significantly affect cognitive trajectories in CN individuals. Moreover, APOE ε4 carriers with positive CSF α-synuclein aggregation experienced more pronounced cognitive decline. This study provides evidence that CSF α-synuclein aggregation is associated with cognitive function and the APOE ε4 allele. These findings suggest that CSF α-synuclein SAA, in combination with APOE ε4 status, could serve as biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline in AD.",Neurobiol Aging
40039717,Bundle Analytics based Data Harmonization for Multi-Site Diffusion MRI Tractometry.,"The neural pathways of the living human brain can be tracked using diffusion MRI-based tractometry. Along-tract statistical analysis of microstructural metrics can reveal the effects of neurological and psychiatric diseases with 3D spatial precision. To maximize statistical power to detect disease effects and factors that influence them, data from multiple sites and scanners must often be combined, yet scanning protocols and hardware may vary widely. For simple scalar metrics, data harmonization methods - such as ComBat and its variants -allow modeling of disease effects on derived brain metrics, while adjusting for effects of scanning site or protocol. Here, we extend this method to pointwise segment analyses of 3D fiber bundles by integrating ComBat into the BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) tractometry pipeline. In a study of the effects of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on 38 white matter tracts, we merge data from 7 different scanning protocols used in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which vary in voxel size and angular resolution. By incorporating ComBat harmonization, we model site- and scanner-specific effects, ensuring the reliability and comparability of results by mitigating confounding variables. We also evaluate choices that arise in extending batch adjustment to tracts, such as the regions used to estimate the correction. We also compare the approach to the simpler approach of modeling the site as a random effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first applications to adapt harmonization to 3D tractometry.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40143849,The role of intracellular and extracellular copper compartmentalization in Alzheimer's disease pathology and its implications for diagnosis and therapy.,"Copper is a trace element indispensable for cellular physiology, integral to cellular redox balance, and a constituent of enzyme active sites, thereby playing a pivotal role in cellular physiological function. Concerning the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the homeostatic balance of copper is perturbed both intracellularly and extracellularly. The copper-amyloid precursor protein (APP) complex facilitates the efflux of copper from cells, leading to intracellular copper depletion. Concurrently, extracellular copper associates with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, precipitating copper-enriched Aβ deposition and augmenting reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain tissue, which finally culminates in oxidative brain damage. The interaction between copper and APP enhances the α-secretase pathway of APP processing while suppressing the β-secretase pathway, resulting in an increased production of soluble APP (sAPP), which contributes to neuroinflammation in the brain tissue. Utilizing the affinity of copper for Aβ plaques, the application of chelating agents to sequester copper within the brain can mitigate neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology. Furthermore, the use of metal imaging techniques to detect copper in the brain offers a potential diagnostic tool for the early identification of AD.",Front Neurosci
40006065,Exploring the Aβ Plaque Microenvironment in Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice by Multimodal Lipid-Protein-Histology Imaging on a Benchtop Mass Spectrometer.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposits in the brain are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Plaques consist of complex mixtures of peptides like Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and characteristic lipids such as gangliosides, and they are targeted by reactive microglia and astrocytes. Background: In pharmaceutical research and development, it is a formidable challenge to contextualize the different biomolecular classes and cell types of the Aβ plaque microenvironment in a coherent experimental workflow on a single tissue section and on a benchtop imaging reader. Methods: Here, we developed a workflow that combines lipid MALDI mass spectrometry imaging using a vacuum-stable matrix with histopathology stains and with the MALDI HiPLEX immunohistochemistry of plaques and multiple protein markers on a benchtop imaging mass spectrometer. The three data layers consisting of lipids, protein markers, and histology could be co-registered and evaluated together. Results: Multimodal data analysis suggested the extensive co-localization of Aβ plaques with the peptide precursor protein, with a defined subset of lipids and with reactive glia cells on a single brain section in APPPS1 mice. Plaque-associated lipids like ganglioside GM2 and phosphatidylinositol PI38:4 isoforms were readily identified using the tandem MS capabilities of the mass spectrometer. Conclusions: Altogether, our data suggests that complex pathology involving multiple lipids, proteins and cell types can be interrogated by this spatial multiomics workflow on a user-friendly benchtop mass spectrometer.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel)
40010509,Unlocking the therapeutic promise of miRNAs in promoting amyloid-β clearance for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that affects cognition and behavior, accounting for 60-70 % of dementia cases. Its mechanisms involve amyloid aggregates, hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, and loss of neural connections. Current treatments have limited efficacy due to a lack of specific targets. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key modulators in AD, regulating gene expression through interactions with mRNA. Dysregulation of specific miRNAs contributes to disease progression by disrupting clearance pathways. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based therapies show promise for AD treatment, particularly when combined with miRNA mimics or antagonists, targeting complex regulatory networks. However, miRNAs can interact with each other, complicating cellular processes and potentially leading to side effects. Our review emphasizes the role of miRNAs in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance and highlights their potential as therapeutic targets and early biomarkers for AD, underscoring the need for further research to enhance their efficacy and safety.",Behav Brain Res
40149967,Binding of Pro-Inflammatory Proteins S100A8 or S100A9 to Amyloid-β Peptide Suppresses Its Fibrillation.,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is a natural depot of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a key player in Alzheimer's disease (AD). HSA and pro-inflammatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9 are involved in Aβ metabolism and its deposition in the brain, serving as probable triggers and therapeutic targets in AD, but their interplay with regard to Aβ binding/fibrillation is unclear. To this end, here we explore the in vitro binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound S100A8 or S100A9 to monomeric Aβ and the influence of the S100 proteins on Aβ fibrillation. The equilibrium dissociation constants of the complexes of dimeric S100A8/S100A9 with Aβ40/42 estimated by biolayer interferometry are 1-5 µM. S100A8 and S100A9 interfere with HSA binding to Aβ. Thioflavin T assay and electron microscopy data show that micromolar S100A8/S100A9 inhibit Aβ40 fibrillation, and the inhibitory effect of S100A8 exceeds that for HSA. The competition for Aβ between HSA and S100A8/S100A9 may contribute to the Aβ-HSA imbalance in the pro-inflammatory conditions in AD.",Biomolecules
40108057,Use of Drugs Affecting GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors and the Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: a Meta-Analysis and Literature Review.,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system is known for its role in cognitive functions and memory processes. However, the activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and their associated pathways influence the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), a key hallmark in the development and prognosis of research examining the relationship between the use of drugs affecting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. This study aimed to examine the association between GABAA receptor-affecting drugs and the risk of AD and dementia, focusing on benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and anesthetics. This meta-analysis included all English articles on AD, dementia, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist medications published before May 2024. The articles were identified through searches conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases. The extracted data were analyzed using STATA software (version 14.2). Q statistics and the I<sup>2</sup> index were used to evaluate heterogeneity, while Egger's test and funnel plot were utilized to detect publication bias. A total of 19 articles (10 case-control and 9 cohort articles) were eligible for the analysis, involving 2,953,980 patients. The use of GABA agonists was found to have a statistically significant relationship with the development of dementia (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.29, I<sup>2</sup> = 87.6%) and AD (RR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.6%). In the drug-based subgroup, we observed that zolpidem consumption was associated with an increased incidence of AD and dementia (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08-1.52, I<sup>2</sup> = 24.3%), similar to the effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs; RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18, I<sup>2</sup> = 87.2%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the duration of follow-up, which ranged from 5 to 11 years across the studies, was significantly associated with heterogeneity (P = 0.036). Our findings indicate that the use of zolpidem and BZD is associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD.",Mol Neurobiol
40058773,The effect of patient sleep disorder and other factors on the Distress Tolerance Scale in caregivers of severe bedridden Alzheimer patients.,"INTRODUCTION: This study investigates whether the ability to tolerate distress decreases in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease who also experience sleep disturbances.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients and their caregivers, who were hospitalised with a diagnosis of severe Alzheimer's disease and were bedridden, were included in the study. The caregivers of the patients completed the Jenkins Sleep Scale to assess the patients' sleep disturbances, and the Distress Tolerance Scale was administered to measure the caregivers' distress tolerance.
RESULTS: A significant difference was observed between patients' sleep disturbance duration for 'Trouble falling asleep', 'Waking up and trouble falling asleep again', and caregivers' Distress Tolerance Scale questions 9 and 13. A negative correlation was found between caregivers' age and question 11 on the Distress Tolerance Scale.
CONCLUSION: The distress tolerance of caregivers of patients with severe Alzheimer's disease and sleep disturbances is negatively affected by the sleep disturbances of the patients and the caregivers' gender, with male caregivers reporting lower distress tolerance.",Psychogeriatrics
40089090,Neurodegenerative diseases: Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of diseases in which the progressive loss of subtype-specific neurons leads to dysfunction. NDDs include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others. Previous studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of NDDs involves various mechanisms, including genetic factors, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the immune response. Recent studies have shown that epigenetic regulation mediates the interactions between DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs, thus affecting gene transcription. A growing body of research links epigenetic modifications to crucial pathways involved in the occurrence and development of NDDs. Epigenetics has also been found to regulate and maintain nervous system function, and its imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of NDDs. The present review summarizes focuses on the role of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of NDDs and provides an overview of the key genes regulated by DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs in NDDs. Further, the current research status of epigenetics in NDDs is summarized and the potential application of epigenetics in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of NDDs is discussed.",Cell Signal
40042509,Effect of knockdown LncRNA SNHG1 on autophagic function in SH-SY5Y cells: a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).,"Alzheimer 's disease, a neurodegenerative disease, is considered a serious global type of dementia affecting predominantly elderly associated with progressive memory loss. Alzheimer 's disease exhibits typical pathological manifestations including neuronal loss, β-amyloid deposition, and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles. Significantly increased expression of long-non -coding transcript RNA, LncRNA SNHG1, was detected in the brain of AD patients. However, it is not clear whether knockdown of LncRNA SNHG1 might improve autophagy function in SH-SY5Y cells and reduce the number of apoptotic cells. The aim of this study was to (1) examine the role of LncRNA SNHG1 on autophagic function of SH-SY5Y cells following induction by Aβ1-42 and (2) elucidate the underlying mechanisms. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors to construct a cell line with stable genetic ability to knock down LncRNA SNHG1 and compared to control empty vector cell line. Following induction with Aβ1-42 for 24 hr, an AD cell model was constructed. Downregulation with LncRNA SNHG1 significantly increased cell viability and lowered the number of apoptotic cells. Concomitantly downregulation of the expression of LncRNA SNHG1 in SH-SY5Y cells induced significant decrease in expression of p-tau and caspase3 associated with elevated expression of Beclin1 and AMBRA1. Our results showed that knockdown of LncRNA SNHG1 in SH-SY5Y cells reduced the number of apoptotic cells by enhancing expression of Beclin1 and AMBRA1. Data suggest that by knocking down the expression of LncRNA SNHG1 may be considered a potential target for compounds to treat AD.",J Toxicol Environ Health A
40144373,Heat shock proteins in protein folding and reactivation.,"Throughout their lives, cells synthesise new and dispose of the old, denatured proteins and insoluble protein aggregates. An important role in maintaining proteostasis is played by chaperones, which fold various proteins and promote degradation of denatured or misfolded proteins via proteasomes or autophagy. Despite protein folding being an accurate process, as organisms age and experience stress, errors accumulate, which leads to the formation of protein aggregates that can result in pathological changes. In addition, stress factors such as elevated temperature and altered pH can promote protein denaturation that can result in the proteins not only losing their native functions, but also gaining novel cytotoxic properties. With the increase of human average lifespan, more and more cases of proteinopathies - diseases caused by disruptions in proteostasis, e. g. Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease etc. - emerge. Therefore, identification of mechanisms preventing the formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates and promoting their clearance is of high importance. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are the molecular chaperones involved in folding nascent proteins and refolding the denatured ones, leading to their reactivation. Heat shock proteins vary in structure and functions and are found in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes discovered to date. HSPs are constantly synthesised in cells under normal conditions, and a multitude of them are dramatically up-regulated during stress, which includes heat shock (which earned them their name) and metabolic stress caused by the increased numbers of misfolded proteins. In this review, we describe mechanisms of action and functions of members of five heat shock protein families.",Vavilovskii Zhurnal Genet Selektsii
40006510,Exploring the Link Between Periodontitis and Alzheimer's Disease-Could a Nanoparticulate Vaccine Break It?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, as approximately 55 million people worldwide are affected, with a significant tendency to increase. It reveals three main pathological features: amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation, responsible for the neurodegenerative changes that slowly lead to deterioration of personality and cognitive control. Over a century after the first case report, effective treatments remain elusive, likely due to an incomplete understanding of the precise mechanisms driving its pathogenesis. Recent studies provide growing evidence of an infectious aetiology for AD, a hypothesis reinforced by findings that amyloid beta functions as an antimicrobial peptide. Among the microorganisms already associated with AD, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), the keystone pathogen of periodontitis (PeD), has received particular attention as a possible aetiological agent for AD development. Herein, we review the epidemiological and genetic evidence linking PeD and Pg to AD, highlighting the identification of periodontal bacteria in post mortem analysis of AD patients' brains and identifying putative mechanistic links relevant to the biological plausibility of the association. With the focus on AD research shifting from cure to prevention, the proposed mechanisms linking PeD to AD open the door for unravelling new prophylactic approaches able to reduce the global burden of AD. As hypothesised in this review, these could include a bionanotechnological approach involving the development of an oral nanoparticulate vaccine based on Pg-specific antigens. Such a vaccine could prevent Pg antigens from progressing to the brain and triggering AD pathology, representing a promising step toward innovative and effective AD prevention.",Pharmaceutics
40031708,Modality Imbalance? Dynamic Multi-Modal Knowledge Distillation in Automatic Alzheimer's Disease Recognition.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the most prevalent form of dementia, necessitates early identification and treatment for the critical enhancement of patients' quality of life. Recent studies strive to explore advanced machine learning approaches with multiple information cues, such as speech and text, to automatically and precisely detect this disease from conversations. However, these multi-modality-based approaches often suffer from a modality- imbalance challenge that leads to performance degradation. That is, the multi-modal model performs worse than the best mono-modal model, although the former contains more information. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Multi-Modal Knowledge Distillation (DMMKD) approach, which dynamically identify the dominant modality and the weak modality, and opt to conduct an inter(cross)-modal or intra-modal knowledge distillation. The core idea is to balance the individual learning speed in the multi-modal learning process by boosting the weak modality with the dominant modality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the introduced DMMKD algorithm, we conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available and widely used AD datasets, i.e. ADReSSo and ADReSS-M. Compared to the multi-modal approaches without dealing with the modality imbalance issue, the introduced DMMKD indicates substantial performance improvements by 15.4% and 10.9% in terms of relative accuracy on the ADReSSo and ADReSS-M datasets, respectively. Moreover, when compared to the state-of-the-art models for automatic AD detection, the DMMKD achieves the best performance of 91.5% and 87.0% accuracies on the two datasets, respectively.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40146773,Presynaptic recycling pool density regulates spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis rate and is upregulated in the presence of β-amyloid.,"Synapses represent a fundamental unit of information transfer during cognition via presynaptic vesicle exocytosis. It has been established that evoked release is probabilistic, but the mechanisms behind spontaneous release are less clear. Understanding spontaneous release is vital, as it plays a key role in maintaining synaptic connections. We propose a model framework for spontaneous release where the reserve pool geometrically constrains recycling pool vesicles, creating an entropic force that drives spontaneous release rate. We experimentally support this framework using SEM, fluorescence microscopy, computational modeling, and pharmacological approaches. Our model correctly predicts the spontaneous release rate as a function of presynapse size. Finally, we use our approach to show how β-amyloid mutations linked to Alzheimer's disease lead to increased spontaneous release rates. These results indicate that synapses regulate the density of the recycling pool to control the spontaneous release rate and may serve as an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease.",Cell Rep

The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a multi-protein assembly in mammalian cells that regulates movement of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope; its function is shown to undergo age-dependent decline during normal aging and is also impaired in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Yet not much is known about the impact of Aβ on NPC function in neurons. Here, we examined NPC and nucleoporin (NUP) distribution and nucleocytoplasmic transport using a mouse model of AD (App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup>) that expresses Aβ in young animals. Our studies revealed that a time-dependent accumulation of intracellular Aβ corresponded with a reduction of NPCs and NUPs in the nuclear envelope which resulted in the degradation of the permeability barrier and inefficient segregation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins, and active transport. As a result of the NPC dysfunction App KI neurons become more vulnerable to inflammation-induced necroptosis - a programmed cell death pathway where the core components are activated via phosphorylation through nucleocytoplasmic shutting. Collectively, our data implicates Aβ in progressive impairment of nuclear pore function and further confirms that the protein complex is vulnerable to disruption in various neurodegenerative diseases and is a potential therapeutic target.",Elife
40145494,"Associations among sleep quality, sleep duration, and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","INTRODUCTION: Although sleep disturbances are widely recognized as risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), their influence on AD biomarkers remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify whether sleep quality or sleep duration affect amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET) in non-demented populations.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were systematically searched up to February 2025.
RESULTS: In total, 30 studies were included comprising 14,997 subjects. Individuals with poor sleep quality exhibited greater PET Aβ burden and higher Aβ42 levels in plasma than those with good sleep quality. Shorter sleep duration was associated with higher Aβ burden on PET. However, no association between either sleep quality or sleep duration and tau levels was found.
DISCUSSION: Sleep may be a modifiable marker of early AD management by modulating Aβ levels.
HIGHLIGHTS: lPoor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration were significantly associated with higher amyloid beta (Aβ) burden detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in non-demented populations. Poor sleep quality was also associated with elevated Aβ42 levels in plasma. lNo significant associations were found between sleep quality or sleep duration and tau levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, or PET. lInterventions targeting sleep could serve as a viable and low-cost prevention strategy for early management of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement
39997526,Tau Imaging: Use and Implementation in New Diagnostic and Therapeutic Paradigms for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects an estimated 6.9 million older adults in the United States and is projected to impact as many as 13.8 million people by 2060. As studies continue to search for ways to combat the development and progression of AD, it is imperative to ensure that confident diagnoses can be made before the onset of severe clinical symptoms and new therapies can be evaluated effectively. Tau positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as one method that may be capable of both, given its ability to recognize the presence of tau, a primary pathologic hallmark of AD; its usefulness in determining the spatial distribution of tau, which is necessary for differentiating AD from other tauopathies; and its association with measures of cognition. This review aims to evaluate the scope of tau PET's utility in clinical trials and practice. Firstly, the potential of using tau PET for differential diagnoses, distinguishing AD from other dementias, is considered. Next, the value of tau PET as a tool for staging disease progression is investigated. Finally, tau PET as a prognostic method for identifying the individuals most at risk of cognitive decline and, therefore, most in need of, and likely to benefit from, intervention, is discussed.",Geriatrics (Basel)
39985416,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection increases risk of Alzheimer's disease in the UK Biobank cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Infections, including bacterial pathogens, have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a common hospital-acquired pathogen associated with significant inflammation, which may contribute to neurodegeneration. This study investigates the relationship between K. pneumoniae infections and AD in the UK Biobank cohort.
METHODS: Using UK Biobank data, we assessed AD diagnoses based on linked healthcare records and identified K. pneumoniae infections using International Classification of Disease 10<sup>th</sup> Edition codes B96.1 and J15.0. A cohort of 502 494 participants was analyzed for AD incidence in relation to demographic factors, educational years, apolipoprotein E (APOE) isoforms, and history of K. pneumoniae infection. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between K. pneumoniae infection and AD risk.
RESULTS: AD incidence was significantly higher among participants with a history of K. pneumoniae infection (1.0%) compared to those without (0.2%; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test two-tailed). Logistic regression analysis revealed that K. pneumoniae infection was associated with an increased risk of AD (odds ratio = 3.32, P < 0.001), independent of age, sex, education, and APOE isoform. Additionally, AD risk was higher among ε4ε4 carriers and increased with age but decreased with additional years of education.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that K. pneumoniae infection may be an independent risk factor for AD. This association underscores the need for further research into infection control and its role in mitigating neurodegenerative disease risk, particularly in populations susceptible to healthcare-associated infections.",Psychogeriatrics
40078479,Investigation of the role of miRNA variants in neurodegenerative brain diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: miRNAs are small noncoding elements known to regulate different molecular processes, including developmental and executive functions in the brain. Dysregulation of miRNAs could contribute to brain neurodegeneration, as suggested by miRNA profiling studies of individuals suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases (NBDs). Here, we report rare miRNA variants in patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: We initially used whole exome sequencing data in a subset of FTD patients (n = 209) from Flanders-Belgium. We then performed targeted resequencing of variant-harboring miRNAs in an additional subset of FTD patients (n = 126) and control individuals (n = 426). Lastly, we sequenced the MIR885 locus in a Flanders-Belgian AD cohort (n = 947) and a total number of n = 755 controls.
RESULTS: WES identified rare seed variants in MIR656, MIR423, MIR122 and MIR885 in FTD patients. Most of these miRNAs bind to FTD-associated genes, implicated in different biological pathways. Additionally, some miRNA variants create novel binding sites for genes associated with FTD. Sequencing of the MIR885 locus in the AD cohort initially showed a significant enrichment of MIR885 variants in AD patients compared to controls (SKAT-O, p-value = 0.026). Genetic association was not maintained when we included sex and APOE status as covariates. Using the miRVaS prediction tool, variants rs897551430 and rs993255773 appeared to evoke significant structural changes in the primary miRNA. These variants are also predicted to strongly downregulate mature miR885 levels, in line with what is reported for MIR885 in the context of AD.
DISCUSSION: Functional investigation of miRNAs/variants described in this study could propose novel miRNA-mediated molecular cascades in FTD and AD pathogenicity. Furthermore, we believe that the genetic evidence presented here suggests a role for MIR885 in molecular mechanisms involved in AD and warrants genetic follow-up in larger cohorts to explore this hypothesis.",Front Genet

This review provides insight into the current knowledge about the methods of amyloid beta detection in vivo and in vitro by fluid tests and brain imaging methods (PET), which allow for preclinical recognition of the disease. Currently, the priority in the development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease has been given to potential changes in the progression of the disease. In light of increasing amounts of data, this review was focused on the diagnostic and therapeutic employment of amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease.",Int J Mol Sci
40076742,"Therapeutic Mechanisms of Medicine Food Homology Plants in Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from Network Pharmacology, Machine Learning, and Molecular Docking.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive function. Currently, there are no effective treatments for this condition. Medicine food homology plants have gained increasing attention as potential natural treatments for AD because of their nutritional value and therapeutic benefits. In this work, we aimed to provide a deeper understanding of how medicine food homology plants may help alleviate or potentially treat AD by identifying key targets, pathways, and small molecule compounds from 10 medicine food homology plants that play an important role in this process. Using network pharmacology, we identified 623 common targets between AD and the compounds from the selected 10 plants, including crucial proteins such as STAT3, IL6, TNF, and IL1B. Additionally, the small molecules from the selected plants were grouped into four clusters using hierarchical clustering. The ConPlex algorithm was then applied to predict the binding capabilities of these small molecules to the key protein targets. Cluster 3 showed superior predicted binding capabilities to STAT3, TNF, and IL1B, which was further validated by molecular docking. Scaffold analysis of small molecules in Cluster 3 revealed that those with a steroid-like core-comprising three fused six-membered rings and one five-membered ring with a carbon-carbon double bond-exhibited better predicted binding affinities and were potential triple-target inhibitors. Among them, MOL005439, MOL000953, and MOL005438 were identified as the top-performing compounds. This study highlights the potential of medicine food homology plants as a source of active compounds that could be developed into new drugs for AD treatment. However, further pharmacokinetic studies are essential to assess their efficacy and minimize side effects.",Int J Mol Sci
40037790,Diffusion MRI in 2-Month-Old Mouse Brain Predicts Alzheimer's Pathology Genotype.,"Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is widely used as a non-invasive means of detecting changes in brain tissue microstructure. In our previous studies, we demonstrated the sensitivity of dMRI to capture brain microstructural alterations in the triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, particularly brain morphological abnormalities in 2-month-old mice, where dMRI was sensitive to myelin abnormalities, to microglia proliferation/activation, and to the larger number of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons previously described in this model at this young age. In this study, we extend our prior work by establishing the dMRI profile of several brain regions relevant to AD pathology in 2-month-old 3xTg-AD and age-matched controls (NC) and by investigating the effectiveness of these dMRI metrics in predicting group genotype using elastic net (EN) logistic regression modeling. EN has been shown to be a high-performance and stable machine learning model for neuroimaging data. Our results demonstrated significant group differences in several ROIs, particularly in the corpus callosum (CC) where fractional anisotropy (FA) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = -1.87), radial diffusivity (D<sub>┴</sub>) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = -1.33), and radial kurtosis (K<sub>┴</sub>) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = -1.34) were statistically significant and the most sensitive dMRI metrics to differentiate between the two groups, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d) values. Moreover, FA in the ventral hippocampus (VH) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = 1.13) and fimbria (Fi) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = -1.04) as well as mean diffusivity (MD) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = 1.10) and D<sub>┴</sub> in the subiculum (Sub) (p &lt; 0.0001; d = 1.12) were also statistically significant and able to clearly distinguish the two groups. Additionally, our results from the trained EN model indicate that FA in the VH, CC, and cingulate cortex (Ctx-Cg) were the three best dMRI metrics to classify the 3xTg-AD mice with an accuracy of 0.95. Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated to assess the goodness of prediction, resulting in 0.96 and 0.94, respectively.",NMR Biomed

This study explored these associations across the AD continuum, focusing on core AD biomarkers and markers of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction.ObjectiveWe investigated whether 1) KL-VSHET is associated with lower AD biomarker burden (Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio, P-tau181, T-tau) and neurodegeneration (NfL); 2) sαKl relates to AD biomarkers, neurodegeneration (NfL), neuroinflammation (GFAP), and synaptic dysfunction (Ng); 3) associations vary by APOE ε4 status and clinical subgroup.MethodsParticipants (n = 223) were categorized as cognitively healthy (n = 38), aMCI-AD (n = 94), and AD dementia (n = 91). KLOTHO genotyping was available for 128 participants; 138 had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum sαKl measurements; and 42 had both. Multiple linear regression evaluated associations between KL-VSHET, sαKl levels, and biomarkers, stratified by APOE ε4 status and clinical subgroup.ResultsOverall, the associations between KL-VSHET and higher CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> and Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio were non-significant (ps ≥ 0.059) except when restricted to APOE ε4 carriers only (β = 0.11, p = 0.008 and β = 0.16, p = 0.033, respectively). Within clinical subgroups, KL-VSHET was positively associated with Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio only in aMCI-AD (β = 0.23, p = 0.034). No significant associations were observed between KL-VSHET and tau biomarkers or NfL. For sαKl, associations with biomarkers were non-significant except for a negative association of serum sαKl with P-tau181 in aMCI-AD (β = -0.25, p = 0.036) and a positive association with Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio in APOE ε4 non-carriers (β = 0.24 p = 0.047).ConclusionsKL-VSHET may help protect against amyloid pathology, particularly in the presence of APOE ε4, and regardless of APOE status in aMCI-AD.",J Alzheimers Dis

40034502,The causal role of lipids in dementia: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal lipid metabolism is one of the pathogeneses of dementia. It is necessary to reveal the relationship between lipids and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: This study used bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization to explore the causal relationship between 179 lipid species and the risk of dementia.
METHODS: We assessed the causal effects of 179 lipid species and four subtypes of dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger method, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were used to analyze the relationship between lipids and dementia. Cochran's Q, MR-Egger intercept test, and MR-PRESSO test were used to test the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of the results. In addition, we performed an inverse MR analysis testing the causal effects of dementia on lipids.
RESULTS: Our study revealed causal effects of glycerophospholipid, glycerolipid, and sterol on the risk of dementia. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and triglycerides play significant roles in AD. Notably, phosphatidylcholine played a protective role in both FTD and DLB. However, this study did not observe a significant effect of phosphatidylinositol on FTD. In the case of VaD, not only glycerophospholipid, but also glycerolipid, exerted an influence, but sterol was also a risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided new evidence supporting the causal role of genetically predicted lipid species in dementia. Future clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the potential role of lipid levels in dementia prevention.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40081583,"Autoimmune thyroid disease is a risk factor for mood disorders, a Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Observational studies have demonstrated associations between autoimmune thyroid disease and both mood disorders and dementia, but the direction of causality has not been established.
METHODS: We employed bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses to assess the causal links between autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves' disease and autoimmune thyroiditis), and mood disorders (major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder) as well as dementia (Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies). We obtained Genome-Wide Association Study data from the Finngen database and IEU Open GWAS. For statistical analysis, we utilized several robust methods inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode. Sensitivity analyses are performed to detect potential horizontal pleiotropy, and to exclude any outlier data points that could skew our results.
RESULTS: Gene-proxy for Graves' disease was associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder (P-value = 0.02), whereas gene-proxy for autoimmune thyroiditis was linked to a greater risk of bipolar disorder (P-value = 0.043). The levels of pleiotropy and heterogeneity among genetic variants suggest bias is unlikely, leave-one-out test confirmed a robust correlation. No indication that mood disorders influence the risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and no evidence of a causal relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Graves' disease is associated with heightened risk of major depressive disorder, and autoimmune thyroiditis is correlated with increased risk of bipolar disorder.",J Affect Disord
40144670,Exosomes enriched with miR-124-3p show therapeutic potential in a new microfluidic triculture model that recapitulates neuron-glia crosstalk in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disease associated with ageing, is the leading cause of dementia. Few people with early AD are eligible for the novel Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug treatments. Accordingly, new tools and early diagnosis markers are required to predict subtypes, individual stages, and the most suitable personalized treatment. We previously demonstrated that the regulation of microRNA (miR)-124 is crucial for proper neuronal function and microglia reshaping in human AD cell models.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an efficient miR-124-3p-loaded exosome strategy and validate its therapeutic potential in using a multi-compartment microfluidic device of neuron-glia that recapitulates age-AD pathological features.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using cortical microglia from mouse pups, separated from glial mixed cultures and maintained for 2 days in vitro (stressed microglia), we tested the effects of SH-SY5Y-derived exosomes loaded with miR-124-3p mimic either by their direct transfection with Exo-Fect™ (ET124) or by their isolation from the secretome of miR-124 transfected cells (CT124). ET124 revealed better delivery effciency and higher potent effects in improving the stressed microglia status than CT124. Tricultures of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (SH-WT) were established in the presence of the human microglia cell line (HMC3) and immortalized human astrocytes (IM-HA) in tricompartmentalized microfluidic devices. Replacement of SH-WT cells with those transfected with APP695 (SH-SWE) in the tricultures and addition of low doses of hydrogen peroxide were used to simulate late-onset AD. The system mimicked AD-associated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation processes. Notably, ET124 exhibited neuroprotective properties across the three cell types in the AD model by preventing neuronal apoptosis and neurite deficits, redirecting microglial profiles towards a steady state, and attenuating the inflammatory and miRNA fingerprints associated with astrocyte reactivity.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study supporting the neuro- and immunoprotective properties of miR-124-engineered exosomes in a microfluidic triculture platform, recapitulating age-related susceptibility to AD. Our system offers potential to develop personalized medicines in AD patient subtypes.",Front Pharmacol
40083386,The effect of tanshinones on cognitive impairments in animal models of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurological illness that poses a significant hazard to human health. A fat-soluble compound called tanshinones was isolated from Danshen, a traditional Chinese herb. Recent years have seen reports of clinical trials examining the effects of tanshinones on cognitive impairment among individuals with AD, as well as the publication of pertinent basic research. Tanshinones are not yet commonly utilized in the therapeutic treatment of AD, and the effectiveness of tanshinones as a treatment program for AD is not yet adequately supported by evidence. To assess the impact of tanshinones on cognitive impairment in experimental rodent models of AD, we carried out a systematic review in this work.
METHOD: All relevant studies on the usage of tanshinones in AD model animals published in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedicine Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure before 8 September 2024, were systematically retrieved. To assess the methodological quality, the CAMARADES checklist was used. Meta-analysis was calculated and graphed in the Stata 14.0 software. For each outcome in every study, the standard mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of each effect size were calculated.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this study. Compared with the AD model group without tanshinones intervention, tanshinones significantly reduced the number of escape latency [SMD = -2.082, 95% CI = (-2.481, -1.683), p < 0.001]. Tanshinones also increased the times of platform crossing [SMD = 1.464, 95% CI = (1.183, 1.744), p < 0.001] and time in target quadrants [SMD = 2.703, 95% CI = (2.132, 3.275), p < 0.001].
CONCLUSION: Tanshinones are thought to have positive effects on cognitive impairment in rodent models of AD, according to the findings of this study. However, the level of quality of the included research may have an impact on the accuracy of positive outcomes. Thus, more high-quality randomized controlled animal studies are required to guide future scientific and clinical research.

39988964,Patterns of sick leave and unemployment prior to a diagnosis of young onset Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Early symptoms in young onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) may be misinterpreted, causing delayed diagnosis. This population-based study aimed to map adverse occupational events preceding YOAD diagnosis as potential prodromal signs.
METHODS: In a register-based, incidence density matched nested case-control study, we examined unemployment and long-term sick leave among individuals diagnosed with YOAD in Danish memory clinics between 2016 and 2022 compared to controls over a 13-year period. Conditional logistic regression produced incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
RESULTS: The study included 2434 cases and 12,170 controls. YOAD patients had higher rates of adverse occupational events, particularly long-term sick leave, starting from 8 years before diagnosis (IRR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.84) and increasing to an IRR of 29.59 (95% CI 18.97-46.13) in the year before diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Adverse occupational events may serve as warning signs of YOAD. Timely diagnosis could facilitate restructuring the remaining working life to accommodate cognitive deficits or in seeking a disability pension.
HIGHLIGHTS: This is a retrospective, nested case-control study of young onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD). Unemployment rates rise significantly 5 years before the YOAD diagnosis. Long-term sick leave rates rise significantly 8 years before the YOAD diagnosis. This emphasizes the importance of occupational history in the timely diagnosis of YOAD. Findings suggest the need for earlier YOAD diagnosis for work-life management.",Alzheimers Dement
40046339,Phase 2 study of palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients.,"Frontotemporal dementia is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which no pharmacological treatments have been approved. Neuroinflammation plays a central role in driving the pathogenic mechanisms underlying frontotemporal dementia. In the last few years, co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline has emerged as a potential therapeutic molecule in neurodegenerative disorders pathogenically related to frontotemporal dementia, for its demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here we wanted to determine whether treatment with co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline may have a clinical impact in frontotemporal dementia patients. We performed a Phase 2, monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients. Forty eight patients with a diagnosis of probable frontotemporal dementia were randomly assign in a 1:1 ratio to receive co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline oral suspension at the dosage of 700 mg + 70 mg twice/day (n = 25) or placebo twice/day (n = 23) for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change at 24-weeks in the Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia Staging Instrument from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and frontotemporal lobar degeneration modules-sum of boxes (CDR plus NACC FTLD-SoB). Secondary outcome measures included the Frontal Assessment Battery, Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini-Mental State Examination and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised. Among 48 patients randomized [mean (SD) age 63.2 (8.4), 23 (47.9%) female], 45 (93%) completed the study. Patients in the co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline group showed less decline for the primary outcome measure (CDR plus NACC FTLD) as compared with patients treated with placebo. The estimated mean change (W0-W24) in CDR plus NACC FTLD score was 0.53 for the co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline group [95% confidence interval (0.12-0.94)] and 1.39 for the placebo group [95% confidence interval (0.96-1.82)], with an estimated mean difference between of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (0.28-1.45), P = 0.005]. Estimated mean change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living score was -1.8 for co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline (95% confidence interval, -3.67 to 0.06) and -7.39 for placebo (95% confidence interval -9.34 to -5.45). Estimated mean change in screening for Aphasia in neurodegeneration scores was -3.987 for co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline (95% confidence interval, -7.75 to -0.22) and -10.35 for placebo (95% confidence interval, -14.33 to -6.37). No effect of treatment was found on other secondary outcome measures. Our results demonstrate that co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline shows promising efficacy in slowing down the progression of cognitive and functional symptoms in frontotemporal dementia patients. These findings warrant further investigation and offer potential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for frontotemporal dementia.",Brain Commun
40037416,Altered spatiotemporal consistency and their genetic mechanisms in mild cognitive impairment: a combined neuroimaging and transcriptome study.,"The Four-dimensional (spatiotemporal) Consistency of local Neural Activities (FOCA) metric was utilized to assess spontaneous whole-brain activity. Despite its application, the genetic underpinnings of FOCA alterations in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remain largely unexplored. To elucidate these changes, we analyzed group FOCA differences in 41 MCI patients and 46 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Integrating the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses to pinpoint genes correlating with MCI-related FOCA changes. We observed heightened FOCA in the frontal-parietal system and diminished FOCA in the temporal lobe and medium cingulate gyrus among MCI patients. These FOCA alterations were spatially linked to the expression of 384 genes, which were enriched in crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex, as well as related pathways. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue and corticothalamic neurons, particularly during late cortical development. They also connected to various behavioral domains. Furthermore, these genes could form a protein-protein interaction network, supported by 34 hub genes. Our results suggest that local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in MCI may stem from the complex interplay of a broad spectrum of genes with diverse functional features.",Cereb Cortex

A predefined path for aging is also apparent, which is consistent with the hypothesis of programmatic aging. In addition, reasonable assumptions about the relative strengths of attractors allow to draw a schematic landscape of fitness: a Wright's diagram. These simple diagrams reproduce known relations between aging, Glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease, and rise interesting questions like the possible connection between programmatic aging and Glioblastoma in this tissue.

40000465,The potential of depressive symptoms to identify cognitive impairment in ageing.,"Depressive symptoms are common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD dementia) and in cognitively unimpaired older adults. However, it is unclear whether they could contribute to the identification of cognitive impairment in ageing. To assess the potential utility of depressive symptoms to distinguish between healthy cognitive ageing and MCI and AD dementia. The diagnostic workup of the cognitive function of 1737 older cognitively unimpaired individuals, 334 people with MCI and 142 individuals with AD dementia relied on a comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment, including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Depressive symptoms were tapped with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) models and the machine learning technique Adaptive Boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) were employed. Stratified repeated random subsampling (stratified bootstrap resampling) was used to recursive partitioning to training- and validation set (70/30 ratio). The average accuracy of the POLR models for the GDS total score in distinguishing between cognitive impairment and healthy cognitive ageing exceeded 78% and was inferior to that of MMSE. Of note, the sensitivity of GDS total score was very low. By employing the AdaBoost algorithm and considering GDS items separately, the average accuracy was higher than 0.72 and comparable to that of the MMSE, while sensitivity- and specificity values were more balanced. The findings of the study provide initial evidence that depressive symptoms may contribute to distinguishing between cognitive impairment and cognitively healthy ageing.",Eur J Ageing
39994980,Identification of the enzymatic cleavage relationship between anti-aging protein α-Klotho and Alzheimer's disease biomarker BACE1.,"BackgroundThe α-Klotho is known to be involved in longevity and various age-related diseases, including cognitive impairment. BACE1, an important enzyme associated with the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), serves as a biomarker for predicting changes in cognitive function. Although both proteins are closely linked to age-related cognitive function, the mechanism of their interaction remains unclear.ObjectiveTo identify the enzymatic digestion relation between α-Klotho and BACE1 and the specific cleavage site.MethodsThirty elderly and forty-five young individuals were recruited. The cleavage product was identified by Coomassie blue staining, western blot, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The concentrations of plasma proteins were measured by ELISA.ResultsA new protein product was identified after the digestion reaction. BACE1 cleaved the α-Klotho peptide 951-981 at the F-T residues. When the F-T residues were replaced with K-K, BACE1 was unable to cleave the mutant peptide. The plasma levels of α-Klotho were significantly lower in elderly participants than in young participants (p < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in plasma BACE1 levels between elderly and young participants (p = 0.164). In elderly adults, there was a significant positive correlation between plasma BACE1 and α-Klotho protein levels (p = 0.009, r = 0.469), while this correlation was not observed in young adults (p = 0.170, r = -0.208).ConclusionsThe anti-aging protein α-Klotho is a substrate of BACE1 with a specific cleavage site at F-T. The BACE1/α-Klotho pathway may serve as a common axis for age-related cognitive decline.",J Alzheimers Dis
40079251,Unprecedented Combination of Rare Degenerative Pathologies in an Octogenarian Ex-Football Player.,"A 79-year-old former professional football player presented with language deficits and cognitive changes. A year later, he had difficulty completing sentences, and 3 years after onset, was reduced to one-word answers. He developed severe apathy and agitation, and became more impulsive. He eventually became mute and had difficulty with walking and balance. The patient had mild repetitive head injury while playing football and three concussions. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed left > right frontotemporal atrophy. Duration of illness was 6 years. Neuropathology revealed an unexpected number and diversity of degenerative pathologies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE, high level), high level Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (A3B3C3), limbic Lewy body disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (type 2), argyrophilic grain disease (Stage 2), and neuronal intranuclear hyaline inclusion body disease. In addition, there was selective and asymmetric involvement of the corticospinal tract with globular oligodendroglial tau pathology corresponding to globular glial tauopathy (Type II). The patchy and irregular accentuation of cortical tau pathology, particularly in the depths of sulci and accumulation around blood vessels, allows the diagnosis of CTE-neuropathologic change. This diagnosis correlated with the past medical history of multiple concussions. In addition, the patient had an unprecedented number and combination of additional degenerative pathologies, including those that are rare, and how they contributed to the clinical symptoms is difficult to interpret. Globular glial tauopathy Type II is a rare disorder that has been mostly reported in association with progressive supranuclear gaze palsy, and these observations support the notion that globular glial tauopathy Type II is an independent entity with isolated corticospinal tract involvement. These observations highlight that rare disorders can occur in the same individual and be overlooked, especially when there is more obvious pathology. It is essential for neuropathologists to consider an extensive array of neuropathological examinations when assessing patients with neurodegenerative disorders.",Neuropathology
40057461,Machine learning to detect Alzheimer's disease with data on drugs and diagnoses.,"BACKGROUND: Integrating machine learning with medical records offers potential for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD), enabling timely interventions.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in constructing a predictive model for AD, designed to predict AD with data up to three years before diagnosis. Using clinical data, including prior diagnoses and medical treatments, we sought to enhance sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic procedures. A second aim was to identify the most important factors in the machine learning models, as these may be important predictors of AD.
DESIGN: The study employed Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning method, to identify diagnoses predictive of AD using primary healthcare data. The analyses were stratified by sex and age groups.
SETTING: The study included individuals within Region Stockholm, Sweden, using medical records from 2010 to 2022.
PARTICIPANTS: The study analyzed clinical data for individuals over the age of 40. Patients with an AD diagnosis (ICD-10-SE codes F00 or G30) during 2010-2012 were excluded to ensure prospective modeling. In total, AD was identified in 3,407 patients aged 41-69 years and 25,796 patients aged over 69.
MEASUREMENTS: The machine learning model ranked predictive diagnoses, with performance assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Known and novel predictors were evaluated for their contribution to AD risk.
RESULTS: AUC values ranged from 0.748 (women aged 41-69) to 0.816 (women over 69), with men across age groups falling within this range. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.79 and 0.66 to 0.79, respectively, across age and gender groups. Negative predictive values were consistently high (≥0.954), while positive predictive values were lower (0.199-0.351). Additionally, we confirmed known risk factors as predictors and identified novel predictors that warrant further investigation. Key predictors included medical observations, cognitive symptoms, antidepressant treatment, visit frequency, and vitamin B12/folic acid treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning applied to clinical data shows promise in predicting AD, with robust model performance across age and sex groups. The findings confirmed known risk factors, such as depression and vitamin B12 deficiency, while also identifying novel predictors that may guide future research. Clinically, this approach could enhance early detection and risk stratification, facilitating timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis

Recognizing the imperative for an objective measure of clinical AD staging, regional perfusion in early-phase β-amyloid-PET may aid as a cost-efficient index for the assessment of neurodegeneration severity in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Regional perfusion deficits in early-phase β-amyloid-PET as well as neuropsychological testing (max. 90 days delay) were evaluated in 82 patients with biologically defined AD according to the ATN classification. In reference to the Braak staging system patients were classified into the groups stage<sup>0</sup>, stage<sup>I-II+</sup>, stage<sup>I-IV+</sup>, stage<sup>I-VI+,</sup> and stage<sup>atypical+</sup> according to regional perfusion deficits in regions of interest (ROIs) published by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Multiple regression analysis controlling for age, gender, and education was used to evaluate the association of regional z-scores on perfusion-phase PET with clinical scores for all patients and with annual decline of cognitive performance in 23 patients with follow-up data.
RESULTS: Patients classified as stage<sup>0</sup> and stage<sup>I-II+</sup> demonstrated significantly superior neuropsychological performance compared to those classified as stage<sup>I-IV+</sup> and stage<sup>I-VI+</sup>. Lower cognitive performance was associated with decreased perfusion in early-phase β-amyloid-PET globally and regionally, with the most pronounced association identified in the left temporal lobe. Mean z-scores on early-phase PET in temporal and parietal regions offered a robust prediction of future annual decline in MMSE and sum scores of the CERAD-Plus (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) test battery.
CONCLUSION: Regional and global perfusion deficits in early-phase β-amyloid-PET can serve as an objective index of neurodegeneration severity and may act as prognostic markers of future cognitive decline in AD.",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging

39996715,From Genetics to Neuroinflammation: The Impact of ApoE4 on Microglial Function in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, impacting millions of people around the world. The apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele is the most prominent genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, dramatically increasing disease susceptibility and accelerating onset compared to its isoforms ApoE2 and ApoE3. ApoE4's unique structure, which arises from single-amino-acid changes, profoundly alters its function. This review examines the critical interplay between ApoE4 and microglia-the brain's resident immune cells-and how this relationship contributes to AD pathology. We explore the molecular mechanisms by which ApoE4 modulates microglial activity, promoting a pro-inflammatory state, impairing phagocytic function, and disrupting lipid metabolism. These changes diminish microglia's ability to clear amyloid-beta peptides, exacerbating neuroinflammation and leading to neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction. Additionally, ApoE4 adversely affects other glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, further compromising neuronal support and myelination. Understanding the ApoE4-microglia axis provides valuable insights into AD progression and reveals potential therapeutic targets. We discuss current strategies to modulate ApoE4 function using small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and gene editing technologies. Immunotherapies targeting amyloid-beta and ApoE4, along with neuroprotective approaches to enhance neuronal survival, are also examined. Future directions highlight the importance of personalized medicine based on individual ApoE genotypes, early biomarker identification for risk assessment, and investigating ApoE4's role in other neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the intricate connection between ApoE4 and microglial dysfunction, highlighting the necessity of targeting this pathway to develop effective interventions. Advancing our understanding in this area holds promise for mitigating AD progression and improving outcomes for those affected by this relentless disease.",Cells
40141302,Noradrenaline Synergistically Enhances Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS and OMV-Induced Interleukin-1β Production in BV-2 Microglia Through Differential Mechanisms.,"Infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), which is a major periodontal pathogen, causes a large number of systemic diseases based on chronic inflammation such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is not yet fully understood how Pg can augment local systemic immune and inflammatory responses during progression of AD. There is a strong association between depression and elevated levels of inflammation. Noradrenaline (NA) is a key neurotransmitter that modulates microglial activation during stress conditions. In this study, we have thus investigated the regulatory mechanisms of NA on the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by microglia following stimulation with Pg virulence factors, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). NA (30-1000 nM) significantly enhanced the mRNA level, promoter activity, and protein level of IL-1β up to 20-fold in BV-2 microglia following treatment with Pg LPS (10 μg/mL) and OMVs (150 μg of protein/mL) in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacological studies have suggested that NA synergistically augments the responses induced by Pg LPS and OMVs through different mechanisms. AP-1 is activated by the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (Aβ<sub>2</sub>R)-mediated pathway. NF-κB, which is activated by the Pg LPS/toll-like receptor 2-mediated pathway, is required for the synergistic effect of NA on the Pg LPS-induced IL-1β production by BV-2 microglia. Co-immunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting and the structural models generated by AlphaFold2 suggested that cross-coupling of NF-κB p65 and AP-1 c-Fos transcription factors enhances the binding of NF-κB p65 to the IκB site, resulting in the synergistic augmentation of the IL-1β promoter activity. In contrast, OMVs were phagocytosed by BV-2 microglia and then activated the TLR9/p52/RelB-mediated pathway. The Aβ<sub>2</sub>R/Epac-mediated pathway, which promotes phagosome maturation, may be responsible for the synergistic effect of NA on the OMV-induced production of IL-1β in BV-2 microglia. Our study provides the first evidence that NA synergistically enhances the production of IL-1β in response to Pg LPS and OMVs through distinct mechanisms.",Int J Mol Sci
40042495,Demographic and clinical characteristics of initial patients receiving amyloid-targeting treatments in the United States after regulatory approval.,"INTRODUCTION: Three treatments for Alzheimer's disease have been approved in the United States. Data are lacking on the characteristics of the initial treatment recipients.
METHODS: We identified treatment recipients in the full Medicare fee-for-service data for 2021 to 2023. We compared their age, sex, race/ethnicity, dual eligibility, comorbidities, and median household income and educational attainment in their residence's ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) to those of the overall Medicare population aged 65+.
RESULTS: Treated patients were more likely to be non-Hispanic White (89% vs 82%) and less likely to be dually eligible (1% vs 8.8%). Average median household income ($97,136 vs $84,449) and proportion of residents with at least a bachelor's degree (41% vs 31%) were higher in treated patients' ZCTAs.
DISCUSSION: The first patients receiving amyloid-targeting treatment represent a more privileged subset. While needing to be confirmed with more data, these results point to the need for efforts to make access more equitable.
HIGHLIGHTS: Little is known about the initial 924 patients receiving amyloid-targeting treatments in the United States from 2021 to 2023. They were more likely to be White and less likely to be dually eligible than the Medicare population. They resided in wealthier and more highly educated areas. Comorbidity burden was similar to that observed in clinical trials. Those initial results point to the need to improve equitable access to treatment.",Alzheimers Dement
40144144,Brain morphology mediating the effects of common genetic risk variants on Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has been associated with alterations in the morphology of multiple brain structures, and it is likely that disease mechanisms differ between brain regions. Coupling genetic determinants of LOAD with measures of brain morphology could localize and identify primary causal neurobiological pathways.
OBJECTIVE: To determine causal pathways from genetic risk variants of LOAD via brain morphology to LOAD.
METHODS: Mediation and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis were performed using common genetic variation, T1 MRI and clinical data collected by UK Biobank and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
RESULTS: Thickness of the entorhinal cortex and the volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala and inferior lateral ventricle mediated the effect of APOE ε4 on LOAD. MR showed that a thinner entorhinal cortex, a smaller hippocampus and amygdala, and a larger volume of the inferior lateral ventricles, increased the risk of LOAD as well as vice versa.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining neuroimaging and genetic data can give insight into the causal neuropathological pathways of LOAD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40071123,The role of protein phosphorylation modifications mediated by iron metabolism regulatory networks in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized mainly by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and abnormal phosphorylation of tau. In recent years, an imbalance in iron homeostasis has been recognized to play a key role in the pathological process of AD. Abnormal iron accumulation can activate various kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to abnormal phosphorylation of tau and amyloid precursor protein, and accelerating the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, iron-mediated oxidative stress not only triggers neuronal damage, but also exacerbates neuronal dysfunction by altering the phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Iron accumulation also affects the phosphorylation status of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, interfering with the dopamine signaling pathway. On the other hand, iron affects iron transport and metabolism in the brain by regulating the phosphorylation of transferrin, further disrupting iron homeostasis. Therapeutic strategies targeting iron metabolism show promise by reducing iron accumulation, inhibiting oxidative stress, and reducing abnormal phosphorylation of key proteins. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of phosphorylation modifications mediated by iron homeostasis imbalance in AD, and discusses the potential of interventions that regulate iron metabolism and related signaling pathways, providing a new theoretical basis for the treatment of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci
40012396,"Roles of Microglia in Synaptogenesis, Synaptic Pruning, and Synaptic Plasticity in Physiological Conditions and Central Nervous System Disorders.","Microglia are resident immune cells in the brain that have been widely studied for their immune surveillance and phagocytosis. In recent years, the important role of microglia in synapse formation, elimination, and plasticity is gradually being recognized. Synapses are the main communication mode between neurons. They undergo constant changes in quantity and plasticity throughout the life cycle, which is the basis of learning and memory. Microglia are highly motile, branched forms that monitor the microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS) and promote synapse formation and maturation. They recognize and phagocytose redundant synapses through specific phagocytosis receptors. Furthermore, microglia regulate synaptic plasticity by releasing various effectors. The roles of microglia on synapses ensure the proper function of neural networks. Synaptic dysfunction and microglia activation are common features in CNS disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Highly heterogeneous microglia exhibit diverse functions in these diseases and participate in disease progression by exacerbating or inhibiting synaptic dysfunction, in addition to neuroimmune and inflammation. In this article, we summarize the role of microglia on synapses under physiological conditions and in CNS disorders. We highlight the possible mechanisms by which microglia regulate synapse function in CNS disorders and how this affects the progression of the diseases. We aim to explore potential therapeutic targets for CNS disorders.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40040308,Decrypting the Possible Mechanistic Role of Fenofibrate in Alzheimer's Disease and Type 2 Diabetes: The Truth and Mystery.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the progressive deposition of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Of note, metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with the development of brain IR and associated neurodegeneration. In addition, AD neuropathology and linked cognitive impairment accelerate the development of peripheral IR and the progression of T2D. Therefore, there is a bidirectional relationship between T2D and AD. It has been demonstrated that AD and T2D induce dysregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) leading to the central and peripheral metabolic disturbances. Hence, dysregulated PPAR-α could be a shared mechanism in both AD and T2D, and restoration of PPAR-α signalling by PPAR-α agonist fenofibrate (FN) may alleviate T2D and AD. Therefore, this review aims to shed light on the potential involvement of PPAR-α in T2D and AD, and how FN could be effective in the management of AD. FN seems to be effective in both AD and T2D by dual neuroprotective and antidiabetic effects that can mitigate AD neuropathology and T2D-related complications by modulating various cellular processes and inflammatory signalling pathways. In conclusion, FN could be a possible candidate in the management of AD and T2D by modulating different signalling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions.",J Cell Mol Med
40093898,Microglial circDlg1 modulates neuroinflammation by blocking PDE4B ubiquitination-dependent degradation associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"Background: Abnormal activation of microglia occurs in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and leads to subsequent neuroinflammation and major AD pathologies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as great potential therapeutic targets in AD. However, the extent of circRNAs entwined and the underlying mechanism in microglia-driven neuroinflammation in AD remain elusive. Methods: The circular RNA Dlg1 (circDlg1) was identified using circRNA microarray screening in magnetic-isolated microglia of APP/PS1 mice. CircDlg1 expression in microglia of APP/PS1 mice and AD patients was validated by FISH. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were conducted to explore the roles of circDlg1 in microglia. Adeno-associated virus 9 preparations for interfering with microglial circDlg1 were microinjected into mouse lateral ventricle to explore influences on microglial response, neuroinflammation and AD pathologies. Y-maze, novel object recognition and Morris water maze tasks were performed to assess cognitive performance. RNA pulldown assays, mass spectrometry analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to validate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of circDlg1. Results: A novel circular RNA circDlg1 was observed elevated using circRNA microarray screening in microglia isolated from APP/PS1 mice and validated increased in intracerebral microglia of AD patients. Microglia-specific knockdown of circDlg1 remarkably ameliorated microglial recruitment and envelopment of amyloid-β (Aβ), mitigated neuroinflammation, and prevented cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, circDlg1 interfered with the interaction between phosphodiesterase 4b (PDE4B) and Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PDE4B. The formed ternary complex protected PDE4B from ubiquitination-dependent degradation via unique N-terminal targeting domain, thus consequently decreasing cAMP levels. We further confirmed that microglial circDlg1 downregulation significantly activated PKA/CREB anti-inflammatory pathway by decreasing PDE4B protein levels in APP/PS1 mice. Conclusion: The novel microglia-upregulated circDlg1 tightly involves in neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice via determining the protein fate of PDE4B. Microglial loss of circDlg1 promotes microglial protective response to Aβ deposition and relieves neuroinflammation, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy that specifically targets the microglial response in AD.",Theranostics
39981183,Targeting natural antioxidant polyphenols to protect neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases: a comprehensive review.,"Polyphenols, naturally occurring phytonutrients found in plant-based foods, have attracted significant attention for their potential therapeutic effects in neurological diseases and neuroinflammation. These compounds possess diverse neuroprotective capabilities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloid properties, which contribute to mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Stroke, and Huntington's Disease (HD). Polyphenols have been extensively studied for their ability to regulate inflammatory responses by modulating the activity of pro-inflammatory genes and influencing signal transduction pathways, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Additionally, polyphenols have shown promise in modulating various cellular signaling pathways associated with neuronal viability, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Epidemiological and clinical studies highlight the potential of polyphenol-rich diets to decrease the risk and alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, polyphenols have demonstrated their therapeutic potential through the regulation of key signaling pathways such as Akt, Nrf2, STAT, and MAPK, which play critical roles in neuroprotection and the body's immune response. This review emphasizes the growing body of evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of polyphenols in combating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, as well as enhancing brain health. Despite the substantial evidence and promising hypotheses, further research and clinical investigations are necessary to fully understand the role of polyphenols and establish them as advanced therapeutic targets for age-related neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammatory conditions.",Front Pharmacol

First, a publicly available dataset of EEG resting state-closed eye recordings containing 36 AD subjects, 23 FTD subjects, and 29 cognitively normal (CN) subjects was used. Then, coherence metrics were utilized to quantify brain functional connectivity, and the differences in coherence between groups across various frequency bands were investigated. Next, spectral clustering was used to analyze variations and differences in brain functional connectivity related to disease states, revealing distinct connectivity patterns in brain electrode position maps. The results demonstrated that brain functional connectivity between different regions was more robust in the CN group, while the AD and FTD groups exhibited various degrees of connectivity decline, reflecting the pronounced differences in connectivity patterns associated with each condition. Furthermore, Coherence-CNN was developed based on CNN and the feature of coherence for three-class classification, achieving a commendable accuracy of 94.32% through leave-one-out cross-validation. This study revealed that Coherence-CNN demonstrated significant performance for distinguishing AD, FTD, and CN groups, supporting the disorder of brain functional connectivity in AD and FTD.",Cogn Neurodyn
40056656,Gegen Qinlian Decoction improves Alzheimer's disease through TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway.,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia, but effective treatments are lacking. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GGQLD) on AD and investigate the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Using network pharmacology and bioinformatics, we identified 376 active ingredients of GGQLD and 427 drug targets. Among these, 7 potential targets (CASP1, MKI67, NFKB1, TLR4, NLRP3, IL1B, and AKT1) were identified as intersecting targets of both GGQLD and AD. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that GGQLD regulates pyroptosis-related pathways. In vivo, GGQLD was administered to AD rat models to assess its effects on spatial learning, memory, and brain tissue injury.
RESULTS: GGQLD significantly reduced latency time by 40 % and increased platform crossings by 60 % in AD rats, demonstrating improved spatial learning and memory abilities. It also reduced hippocampal tissue damage and abnormal Aβ deposition. Mechanistically, GGQLD downregulated pyroptosis-related targets (TLR4, NF-κB, NLRP3, IL-1β, and Caspase-1), which were significantly upregulated in AD. ROC analysis demonstrated strong diagnostic significance for these genes, with AUC values exceeding 0.70. Functional enrichment and KEGG analysis further indicated that GGQLD exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple pathways, particularly the NOD-like receptor pathway, Necroptosis, and NF-kappa B pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that GGQLD improves spatial learning, reduces brain tissue damage, and alleviates inflammation in AD through the regulation of pyroptosis-related pathways, providing evidence for its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD.",Tissue Cell
40031716,"The More, the Better? Evaluating the Role of EEG Preprocessing for Deep Learning Applications.","The last decade has witnessed a notable surge in deep learning applications for electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis, showing promising improvements over conventional statistical techniques. However, deep learning models can underperform if trained with bad processed data. Preprocessing is crucial for EEG data analysis, yet there is no consensus on the optimal strategies in deep learning scenarios, leading to uncertainty about the extent of preprocessing required for optimal results. This study is the first to thoroughly investigate the effects of EEG preprocessing in deep learning applications, drafting guidelines for future research. It evaluates the effects of varying preprocessing levels, from raw and minimally filtered data to complex pipelines with automated artifact removal algorithms. Six classification tasks (eye blinking, motor imagery, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, sleep deprivation, and first episode psychosis) and four established EEG architectures were considered for the evaluation. The analysis of 4800 trained models revealed statistical differences between preprocessing pipelines at the intra-task level for each model and at the inter-task level for the largest model. Models trained on raw data consistently performed poorly, always ranking last in average scores. In addition, models seem to benefit more from minimal pipelines without artifact handling methods. These findings suggest that EEG artifacts may affect the performance and generalizability of deep neural networks.",IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng
40068518,Unraveling the role of the IL-20 cytokine family in neurodegenerative diseases: Mechanisms and therapeutic insights.,"The IL-20 cytokine family, comprising IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26, has emerged as a critical player in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases due to its multiple roles in inflammation, tissue repair, and immune modulation. These cytokines signal through IL-20 receptor complexes (IL-20RA/IL-20RB and IL-22RA1/IL-20RB), triggering diverse immune processes. Recent evidence highlights their significant contributions to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in central nervous system disorders. IL-20 family cytokines impact microglial activation, which, when dysregulated, exacerbates neuronal damage. Specifically, IL-20 and IL-24 are linked to elevated pro-inflammatory markers in glial cells, promoting neurodegeneration. In contrast, IL-22 exhibits dual functionality, exerting protective and pathological roles depending on the inflammatory milieu. Key mechanisms involve the regulation of blood-brain barrier integrity, oxidative stress, and autophagy. IL-22 and IL-24 also protect neurons by enhancing antioxidant defenses and maintaining epithelial barrier function, while their dysregulation contributes to blood-brain barrier disruption and protein aggregate accumulation, hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Elevated IL-22 levels in Alzheimer's disease and IL-19's regulatory role in multiple sclerosis suggest they may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. IL-26's role in amplifying inflammatory cascades further underscores the complexity of this cytokine family in neurodegenerative pathology. Therapeutically, strategies targeting IL-20 cytokines include monoclonal antibodies, receptor modulation, and recombinant cytokine administration. These approaches aim to mitigate neuroinflammation, restore immune balance, and protect neuronal integrity. This review underscores the IL-20 family's emerging relevance in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Int Immunopharmacol

It is a critical component of many fundamental central nervous system (CNS) processes. Recently, a connection has been shown between Fyn malfunction and the pathogenic processes exhibited in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a significant factor in worldwide mortality and disability. Due to the rising demographic of elderly individuals, there is a projected increase in incidence of AD in the forthcoming years. This study aims to identify prospective phytochemicals that can be utilized in developing a new protein kinase inhibitor for the therapeutic intervention of AD. The lack of therapeutic interventions capable of preventing the progression of AD is a significant concern thus, it is imperative to identify potential targets. This study employed a virtual screening approach to discover potential Fyn-kinase inhibitors from Berberis lycium (B.ly.) phytoconstituents. Three molecules, Canadine, N-Methyltetrahydroberberine (N-MTHB), and Tetrahydroberberine (THB), were found to have a strong affinity for the binding pocket of Fyn kinase. The docked complexes B.ly. compounds with Fyn underwent all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess their stability and interactions.

40004604,Plasma Biomarkers for Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Implications for Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities: A Comprehensive Review.,"Anti-amyloid therapies (AATs) are increasingly being recognized as promising treatment options for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), small areas of edema and microbleeds in the brain presenting as abnormal signals in MRIs of the brain for patients with AD, are the most common side effects of AATs. While most ARIAs are asymptomatic, they can be associated with symptoms like nausea, headache, confusion, and gait instability and, less commonly, with more serious complications such as seizures and death. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been found to be a major risk for ARIA development. The identification of sensitive and reliable non-invasive biomarkers for CAA has been an area of AD research over the years, but with the approval of AATs, this area has taken on a new urgency. This comprehensive review highlights several potential biomarkers, such as Aβ40, Aβ40/42, phosphorylated-tau217, neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein, secreted phosphoprotein 1, placental growth factor, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, cluster of differentiation 163, proteomics, and microRNA. Identifying and staging CAA even before its consequences can be detected via neuroimaging are critical to allow clinicians to judiciously select appropriate candidates for AATs, stratify monitoring, properly manage therapeutic regimens for those experiencing symptomatic ARIAs, and optimize the treatment to achieve the best outcomes. Future studies can test potential plasma biomarkers in human beings and evaluate predictive values of individual markers for CAA severity.",J Clin Med

The cohort included 30,403 patients with incident dementia diagnosis from 2006-2016. We described frequencies, patterns, and interrelations of diagnoses (Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, other specific dementia, unspecified dementia (UD), antidementia drugs (ADD), and professional groups. We described switches in diagnostic and medication patterns between index quarter and following quarters, and evaluated the prescriptions in relation to national guidelines.ResultsA total of 87% of patients received a diagnosis of UD in at least one quarter of insurance. In the quarter of incident diagnosis, 14% of patients received more than one diagnostic code of dementia, whereas over the course of observation, the majority of patients received more than one diagnostic code (61%). Most patients were diagnosed by a general practitioner without involving a specialist. All professional groups primarily made UD diagnoses except specialists who mainly diagnosed AD. Thirty-five percent of all patients and 67% of AD patients were prescribed an ADD at least once.ConclusionsSpecialists made the most specific diagnoses and prescribed most ADDs.

In sporadic AD and in families with higher risk of AD, correlation with apolipoprotein E4 (APOE) allele expression has been found. How APOE4 induces its pathological effects is still unclear. Several studies indicate that autophagy, a major degradation pathway trough the lysosome, may be compromised in AD. Here we studied, the effects of APOE isoforms expression in microglia cells. By using an in-situ model, the clearance of Aβ plaques from brain sections of transgenic 5xFAD mice by the APOE expressing microglia was examined. The results show that APOE4 microglia has Impairment In clearance of insoluble Aβ plaques as compared to APOE3 and APOE2 microglia. Furthermore, APOE4 affect the uptake of soluble Aβ. We found that microglia expressing APOE4 exhibit reduced autophagic flux as compared to those expressing APOE3. The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine also blocked Aβ plaque uptake in APOE3 expressing cells. Furthermore, we found that APOE4 expressing microglia have altered mitochondrial dynamics protein expression, mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial activity compared to those expressing APOE2, and APOE3. Rapamycin treatment corrected Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in APOE4-expressing cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that APOE4 impairs the activation of autophagy, mitophagy, and Aβ clearance and that autophagy-inducing treatments, such as rapamycin, can enhance autophagy and mitochondrial functions in APOE4 expressing microglia. Our results reveal a direct link between APOE4 to autophagy activity in microglia, suggesting that the pathological effects of APOE4 could be counteracted by pharmacological treatments inducing autophagy, such as rapamycin.",Inflamm Res

RESULTS: iPRS-DEM was associated with dementia risk independently of APOE in the elderly (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR]<sub>per1SD </sub>= 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 1.28), which generalized to Europeans (EUR-sHR<sub>per1SD </sub>= 1.28, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.51]), East-Asians (EAS-sHR<sub>per1SD </sub>= 5.29, 95% CI: 1.43 to 34.36), and memory-clinic participants (sHR<sub>per1SD </sub>= 1.25, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.42). Prediction was comparable to clinical risk factors in older community-dwelling people, with improved performance among memory-clinic patients. Risk stratification was enhanced by defining four genetic risk groups with iPRS-DEM and APOE ε4, reaching five-fold increased risk in APOE ε4+/iPRS-DEM+ memory-clinic participants.
DISCUSSION: Alongside APOE ε4, iPRS-DEM may refine risk stratification for the enrichment of dementia clinical trials and prevention programs.
HIGHLIGHTS: iPRS-DEM reflects neurodegenerative and vascular contribution to dementia. We show iPRS-DEM captures additional dementia genetic risk beyond APOE and AD-PRS. iPRS-DEM, in combination with APOE ε4, shows promise for dementia risk stratification. Our results generalize across both population-based and memory-clinic settings. We show transportability of iPRS-DEM to East Asian ancestry.",Alzheimers Dement
40073978,Unraveling the mystery of citrate transporters in Alzheimer's disease: An updated review.,"A key molecule in cellular metabolism, citrate is essential for lipid biosynthesis, energy production, and epigenetic control. The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative illness marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, may be linked to dysregulated citrate transport, according to recent research. Citrate transporters, which help citrate flow both inside and outside of cells, are becoming more and more recognized as possible participants in the molecular processes underlying AD. Citrate synthase (CS), a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, supports mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter synthesis, particularly acetylcholine (ACh), essential for cognition. Changes in CS activity affect citrate availability, influencing energy metabolism and neurotransmitter production. Choline, a precursor for ACh, is crucial for neuronal function. Lipid metabolism, oxidative stress reactions, and mitochondrial function can all be affected by aberrant citrate transport, and these changes are linked to dementia. Furthermore, the two main pathogenic characteristics of AD, tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, may be impacted by disturbances in citrate homeostasis. The goal of this review is to clarify the complex function of citrate transporters in AD and provide insight into how they contribute to the development and course of the illness. We aim to provide an in-depth idea of which particular transporters are dysregulated in AD and clarify the functional implications of these dysregulated transporters in brain cells. To reduce neurodegenerative processes and restore metabolic equilibrium, we have also discussed the therapeutic potential of regulating citrate transport. Gaining insight into the relationship between citrate transporters and the pathogenesis of AD may help identify new indicators for early detection and creative targets for treatment. This study offers hope for more potent ways to fight this debilitating illness and is a crucial step in understanding the metabolic foundations of AD.",Ageing Res Rev
40088370,Interplay between PI3k/AKT signaling and caspase pathway in Alzheimer disease: mechanism and therapeutic implications.,"Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by cognitive impairment, neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunction. The interplay between the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway and the caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade plays a pivotal role in its progression. The signaling pathway responsible for neuronal survival also regulates synaptic plasticity and resistance to oxidative stress, whereas caspase activation accelerates neurodegeneration by triggering cell death and inflammation. Dysregulation of these pathways leads to amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, creating a negative feedback loop and accelerating disease progression. Emerging treatment methods that target PI3K/AKT activation and caspase inhibition have showed promise in preclinical models, preventing neuronal apoptosis while retaining cognitive function. This review investigates the molecular processes driving PI3K/AKT and caspase crosstalk, their significance in Alzheimer's disease, and prospective therapeutic strategies aiming at regulating these pathways to improve disease outcomes.",Inflammopharmacology
40151795,The short-term impacts of COVID-2019 on depressive symptoms and cognitive decline: A community-based cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Neurological and psychological sequelae may persist after the infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Depression and cognitive decline could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on depressive symptoms and cognitive decline.
METHODS: The data was from Beijing Research on Ageing and Vessel (BRAVE), which included all residents in the Xishan community. The first wave survey was performed from October to November 2019 (baseline) before the COVID-19 pandemic. The second wave survey was interrupted into two periods due to the introduction of the Ten New Measures, from October to November 2022 (no participants were infected) and from March to April 2023 (most participants were infected), providing an excellent opportunity to investigate the short-term impacts of COVID-19 on depressive symptoms and cognitive function with linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Among a total of 1012 participants, the median (interquartile range, IQR) age at baseline was 60.00 (56.00, 65.00) years, with 374 (36.96%) men and 479 participants COVID-19 infected. Compared with uninfected participants, the infected did not suffer pronounced depressive symptoms (β = -0.047; 95% CI -0.204 to 0.110) and accelerated declines in global cognition (β = 0.116; 95% CI -0.001 to 0.234) from wave 1 to wave 2. Sensitive analyses shared generally consistent findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of COVID-19 infection on depressive symptoms and cognitive decline were not significant among participants in the BRAVE cohort. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term impacts on neurological and psychiatric symptoms.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
39998851,Impact of the polygenic risk scores for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies indicate a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and elevated risk of dementia. However, the impact of ADHD on cognition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in individuals with cognitive impairment remains unclear.
METHODS: We computed weighted ADHD polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS) in 938 cognitively impaired participants (674 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 264 dementia; mean age 73.5 years). A subset underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET).
RESULTS: We observed lower executive function in individuals with high ADHD-PRS for both MCI and dementia participants. Higher levels of CSF phosphorylated tau, but not Aβ, were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. Increased ADHD-PRS was associated with glucose hypometabolism in the frontal and parietal cortices.
DISCUSSION: ADHD-PRS is associated with a more severe disease presentation in individuals with cognitive impairment due to dementia, characterized by impaired executive function, elevated tau pathology, and hypometabolism in the frontal and parietal cortices.
HIGHLIGHTS: We calculated the genetic liability for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS). Elevated ADHD-PRS was associated with executive function deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau, but not amyloid beta (Aβ), were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with brain hypometabolism in individuals with AD dementia. Hypometabolism in the parietal cortex mediated the effects of ADHD-PRS on executive function.",Alzheimers Dement
40078231,"Global, regional, and national burden of tobacco-related neurological disorders from 1990 to 2021: Trends and future projections.","INTRODUCTION: Tobacco use is as a major public health concern around the world, adversely impacting quality of life. Our study aims to analyze the trends in the burden of tobacco-related neurological disorders (ND) at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021, as well as potential future trends.
METHODS: We performed a secondary dataset analysis for the assessment of mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, to explore the burden of tobacco-related ND. We also analyzed the associations between the burden of ND and factors such as age, gender, and the Sociodemographic Index (SDI).
RESULTS: In 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) for neurological disorders were 0.50 per 100000 persons (95% UI: -0.15-1.98) and 11.25 per 100000 persons (95% UI: 1.36-34.36), respectively. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) had a particularly significant impact on the burden of ND. However, the ASDR for Parkinson's disease was -8.38 per 100000 persons (95% UI: -10.72 - -6.20). The burden of disease was greater in men and older people, with substantial regional variation. While aging and population growth might contribute to the increase in DALYs for tobacco-related ND, epidemiological changes have the potential to reduce the burden. From 2022 to 2050, the BAPC model predicted a decline in the age-standardized rate (ASR) of DALYs and mortality for tobacco-related ND, globally.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco use increased the burden of ND such as ADOD and multiple sclerosis (MS), while reducing the burden of Parkinson's disease (PD). The burden of disease was disproportionately higher among older individuals and males, with significant disparities across nations and regions. Over the past 32 years, the burden of these diseases has gradually decreased, and this trend is expected to continue from 2022 to 2050.",Tob Induc Dis
40015759,American's overall and equity-based societal valuation of a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment: Results from a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate Americans' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for universal access to a disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment with a discrete choice experiment in a nationally representative sample. As part of this experiment, we examined whether providing information about the higher disease burden among minorities and persons of lower socioeconomic status (SES) changes WTP.
METHODS: We conducted an information experiment using the nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS) panel. Participants were provided with general information about AD and a hypothetical treatment that reduces disease progression by 30 %. Two-thirds of the sample were randomized to receive additional information about the higher prevalence of Alzheimer's among either lower SES groups or racial/ethnic minorities. We measured participants' WTP for making the treatment nationally available as a fixed annual fee and income-proportionate fee. Differences in WTP between those exposed to the additional information and those who were not provide the societal valuation of the equity-enhancing effects of the AD treatment.
RESULTS: Average valuations were $252, $260 and $247 per year, and 0.59 %, 0.59 % and 0.61 % of earned income, for the control, race/ethnicity and SES frames, respectively-all statistically indistinguishable. These average results imply that Americans would be willing to pay $33.7 billion based on the fixed fee and $51.4 billion based on the income-related charge for universal access to an AD treatment annually, but their valuation does not further increase when informed about equity considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: While Americans value universal access to an AD treatment highly, health equity considerations did not significantly alter respondents' WTP.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
39992714,Chronic RNA G-quadruplex accumulation in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we examined human hippocampal postmortem tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD. We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons with the accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation is linked to proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for future treatments and diagnoses.",Elife
39975973,The role of sleep in Alzheimer's disease: a mini review.,Sleep is a stereotyped and well-preserved series of neurophysiological states that are essential for overall health and brain functioning. Emerging research suggests that sleep disturbances are not only associated with but also causally contribute to neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. This mini-review examines some of the current knowledge and evidence for relationships between sleep abnormalities and Alzheimer's disease within context of possible uses and limitations of sleep biomarkers for evaluation of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding these relationships could lead to readily accessible and easily quantifiable biomarkers of Alzheimer's dementia.,Front Neurosci
40020758,Diagnosing preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease with visual atrophy scales in the clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND:  Visual atrophy scales from the medial temporal region are auxiliary biomarkers of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, they may correlate with progression from cognitively unimpaired (CU) status to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and they become a valuable tool for diagnostic accuracy.
OBJECTIVE:  To compare the medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and entorhinal cortex atrophy (ERICA) scores measured through magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans as a useful method for probable AD diagnosis regarding clinical diagnosis and amyloid positron-emission tomography (PET).
METHODS: Two neurologists blinded to the diagnoses classified 113 older adults (age &gt; 65 years) through the MTA and ERICA scores. We investigated the correlations involving these scores and sociodemographic data, amyloid brain cortical burden measured through PET imaging with (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B (11C-PIB PET), and clinical cognitive status, in individuals diagnosed as CU (CU; N = 30), presenting mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 52), and AD patients (N = 31).
RESULTS:  The inter-rater reliability of the atrophy scales was excellent (0.8-1) according to the Cohen analysis. The CU group presented lower MTA scores (median value: 0) than ERICA (median value: 1) scores in both hemispheres. The 11C-PIB-PET was positive in 45% of the sample. In the MCI and AD groups, the ERICA score presented greater sensitivity, and the MTA score presented greater specificity. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis was sufficient and no more than 70% for both scores in AD.
CONCLUSION:  In the present study, we found moderate sensitivity for the ERICA score, which could be a better screening tool than the MTA score for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. However, none of the scores were useful imaging biomarkers in preclinical AD.",Arq Neuropsiquiatr
40039021,Graph-based deep learning models in the prediction of early-stage Alzheimers.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common age-related problem and progresses in different stages, from cognitively normal to early mild cognitive impairment, and severe dementia. This study investigates the predictive potential of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived functional connectivity (FC) in understanding Alzheimer's progression. Leveraging deep learning and graph-based models, we introduce two key contributions: 1) a comparative analysis of rs-fMRI time points and FC for Alzheimer's prediction. 2) an innovative graph transformer variant incorporating self-clustering for enhanced prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset with 830 subjects reveal two notable conclusions. Firstly, rs-fMRI time points offer limited utility compared to functional network connectivity for transformer-based models, even when considering temporal information. Secondly, a clustering-based attention module proves effective for classifying brain networks in predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, providing valuable insights for future research and clinical applications.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40029927,Retinal and thalamic alterations in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that lead to decreased quality of life due to behavioral, motor, and cognitive impairments. Due to the widespread pathological nature of AD, many brain regions are affected by Aβ plaques including regions important for vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus which is critical for relaying signals from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Using a wide range of techniques including electrophysiological approaches, in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods, and immunohistochemistry in a mouse model with progressing amyloidosis (5xFAD), the goal of this study was to determine whether AD-like pathology disrupts neuronal and synaptic structure and function in the visual system. In vivo electroretinogram recordings revealed photoreceptor dysfunction in the 6- and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, while optical coherence tomography indicated no changes in 5xFAD retinal thickness from 9 to 12 months. In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the rodent homolog of the primate LGN, we identified decreased densities of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals and fewer thalamocortical (TC) neuron cell bodies. No detectable deficits in excitatory synaptic function or TC neuron dendritic structure were seen in the dLGN, and reflexive visual behavior was also found to be normal in the 5xFAD mice. These results indicate relatively modest amyloid-triggered dysfunction in these stages of the visual system suggesting that Aβ plaque formation may play only a small role in the visual system dysfunction seen in AD patients. These results may also point to potential compensatory mechanisms that preserve function of visual pathways in the 5xFAD visual system.",PLoS One
40074130,Explore peptides extracted from gliadin hydrolysates suppressing BACE1 activity and restraining Aβ protein deposition.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) constitutes approximately 70 % of dementia cases and is the most prevalent form of dementia. Current therapeutic options, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, provide symptomatic relief but do not cure the disease and often come with side effects. The primary pathological features of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, with amyloid plaques formed by the abnormal accumulation of Amyloid-β (Aβ). BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1), a β-secretase, is a key initiator in amyloidosis. Previous research has shown that G-Bro hydrolysate, produced from the bromelain hydrolysis of gliadin, has optimal BACE1 inhibitory efficiency. This study employs G-Bro hydrolysate for nano UHPLC-ESI Q-TOF mass spectrometry to identify peptide fragment sequences and conducts BACE1 inhibition assays to isolate the most effective peptide, VR-peptide. Using the N2a/PS/APP cell model, we explored the impact of chemically synthesized VR-peptide on BACE1 protein expression, the secretion of soluble APP (sAPP), and levels of Aβ and intracellular Aβ1-42. Results demonstrate that VR-peptide achieves a BACE1 inhibitory rate of 63.8 % and reduces BACE1 expression by over 90 % in comparison with untreated N2a/PS/APP cells. It shifts the balance between extracellular Aβ monomers and aggregates, favoring monomer formation and decreasing intracellular Aβ1-42 levels by over 56 %, underscoring its neuroprotective potential. In conclusion, VR-peptide exhibits promise as a BACE1 inhibitor and a preventive agent against Alzheimer's disease. Derived from hydrolyzed cereal foods, it could be effectively paired with a suitable drug delivery system for enhanced neuronal penetration, paving the way for neuroprotective peptide products targeting Alzheimer's disease.",Int J Biol Macromol
40129186,Simultaneous Monitoring of Tyrosinase and ATP in Thick Brain Tissues Using a Single Two-Photon Fluorescent Probe.,"Cellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism in the central nervous system are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, their real-time and concurrent monitoring in thick tissues remains challenging. Herein, a single dual-emission two-photon fluorescent probe (named DST) is designed for the simultaneous tracking of tyrosinase (TYR) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby enabling the real-time monitoring of both neurocellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism in brain tissue. The developed DST probe exhibits excellent sensitivity and selectivity toward TYR and ATP, with distinctive responses in the blue and red fluorescence channels being observed without spectra crosstalk. Using this probe, the correlation and regulatory mechanism between TYR and ATP during oxidative stress are uncovered. Additionally, the two-photon nature of this probe allows alterations in the TYR and ATP levels to be monitored across different brain regions in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Notably, a significant decrease in ATP levels is revealed within the somatosensory cortex (S1BF) and caudate putamen brain regions of an AD mouse, alongside an increase in TYR levels within the S1BF and laterodorsal thalamic nucleus brain regions. These findings indicate the potential of applying the spatially resolved regulation of neurocellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",Adv Sci (Weinh)

OBJECTIVES: This study examined factors influencing response rates to an online survey about disease-modifying drugs for AD among participants in the Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort (J-TRC) webstudy.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective observational study.
SETTINGS: Online survey in Japan using Google Forms.
PARTICIPANTS: We enrolled the eligible J-TRC webstudy participants who had registered before September 2023. We sent them an invitation e-mail including a questionnaire web address on November-December 2023, in order to conduct an online survey regarding their perceptions of disease-modifying therapy drug that was approved in July 2023, Japan.
MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed the impact of mailed day of the week (DOW), participant gender, age, employment status, and educational background with/without response to the invitation, quantified by the odds ratio of response.
RESULTS: Among approximately 10,400 J-TRC web study participants who sent invitation emails, the overall response rate was approximately 20 %, without significant influence depending on the DOW when the survey invitation was sent. Individuals who were older (50s-70s), retired, or had higher education levels were significantly more likely to respond, regardless of the DOW. Differences in response rates by sex/gender were observed, but were largely influenced by the employment status.
CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve response rates and enhance data quality, these findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the design of future online studies/surveys in the field of AD and dementia, particularly for targeting cognitively unimpaired middle-aged and older populations.",JAR Life
40079275,A Novel Oxo-Palmatine Derivative 2q as Potent Reversal Agents Against Alzheimer's Disease.,"Palmatine (PAL), as an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, had been demonstrated efficacy in ameliorating the manifestations of AD. Our research group has previously designed and synthesized the novel oxo-PAL derivative 2q and found that it has exhibited notable neuroprotective properties. However, compound 2q therapeutic impact on AD remains uncertain. In the current investigation, our findings demonstrated that compound 2q displayed significant anti-AβOs activity in vitro by using xCELLigence analysis, and showed a high likelihood of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, administration of compound 2q yielded a notable amelioration in Aβ accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in 3×Tg mice. Additionally, it was observed that compound 2q potentially enhanced the pathological characteristics of AD by targeting Potassium/Sodium Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel 2 (HCN2). In conclusion, compound 2q emerged as a promising candidate for AD treatment, as it effectively restored AD-associated pathological impairments. Furthermore, it has been identified as a potential target of HCN2, thereby offering novel avenues for the development of treatments for AD.",Drug Dev Res
39998900,Tau pathology is associated with postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in early Alzheimer's disease in a sex-specific manner.,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the associations of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) with tau deposition and cognitive ability in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Twenty-six cognitively impaired (CI) and 14 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals underwent mGluR5 positron emission tomography (PET) ([<sup>18</sup>F]PSS232), amyloid PET ([<sup>18</sup>F]florbetapir), and tau PET ([<sup>18</sup>F]MK6240), and neuropsychological assessment. The relationships among mGluR5 availability, tau deposition, and neuropsychological assessment were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and mediation analyses.
RESULTS: CI patients had lower mGluR5 in the hippocampus than CU (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr]: 2.03 ± 0.25 vs 1.79 ± 0.17, p = 0.003). Hippocampal mGluR5 was negatively associated with hippocampal tau deposition (r = -.46, p = 0.003) and positively associated with cognitive performance, but only in women. Hippocampal tau deposition mediated the effect of mGluR5 on cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: Reduced hippocampal mGluR5 is negatively related with tau deposition in most cortical regions and positively associated with cognitive performance, making it a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively impaired (CI) patients exhibited lower metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability in the hippocampus than cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was negatively associated with tau deposition in widespread cortex. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was positively associated with cognitive performance. The close association of mGluR5 with tau and cognition performance exists only in females. Tau pathology mediated the relationship between mGluR5 availability and cognition.",Alzheimers Dement

The existing class imbalance is addressed by an ensemble learning approach, while various attribution-based and counterfactual-based interpretability methods are leveraged towards producing diverse explanations related to the pathophysiology of MCI/AD. A unification method combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the interpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded 87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score. The attribution-based interpretability methods highlighted significant volumetric and genetic features related to MCI/AD risk. The unification method provided useful insights regarding those features' necessity and sufficiency, further showcasing their significance in MCI/AD diagnosis.",Sci Rep
39996845,RhoA/ROCK/GSK3β Signaling: A Keystone in Understanding Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and loss of neuronal integrity. Emerging evidence suggests that RhoA, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), and their downstream effector molecule glycogen synthase 3β (GSK3β) interact within a complex signaling pathway (RhoA/ROCK/GSK3β) that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. RhoA, a small GTPase, along with its downstream effector, ROCK, regulates various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity. GSK3β, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a key role in neuronal function and AD pathology, including the regulation of tau phosphorylation and amyloid-beta cleavage. Overactive GSK3β has been closely linked to tau hyperphosphorylation, neurodegeneration, and the progression of AD. Thus, GSK3β has been considered as a promising therapeutic target for treating AD and mitigating cognitive impairment. However, clinical trials of GSK3β in AD have faced considerable challenges due to the complexity of the specific neuronal inhibition of GSK3β. In this review, we summarize the literature regarding the relationship of RhoA/ROCK and GSK3β signaling pathways in AD pathogenesis. We further discuss recent findings of the sTREM2-transgelin-2 (TG2) axis as a potential mediator of this complex pathway and provide our review on a novel targeting strategy for AD.",Curr Issues Mol Biol
40146982,Stress and Hypertension Among African American Female Family Caregivers of Persons Living With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Protocol for a Pilot Internet-Based Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) neglect their health, including by ignoring stress levels. African American women are vulnerable and susceptible to hypertension. Chronic caregiving stress and hypertension place them at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Addressing stress reactivity or resilience is vital in lessening their caregiving stress, enhancing their quality of life (QOL), and fostering healthy blood pressure (BP) self-care behaviors.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) plus the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) intervention in this population and to evaluate its effect on ADRD caregivers' stress and QOL. Additionally, it explores the mediation of stress reactivity or resilience between interventions and self-care behaviors.
METHODS: A small randomized controlled trial pilot study will recruit 28 African American or Black female caregivers aged 40 years diagnosed with hypertension and on an antihypertensive medication. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the MIM DASH or the Alzheimer's Association caregiver training group (attention control). Trained facilitators will deliver both interventions over 8 weeks through 1-hour, group, internet-based sessions, via video or telephone. After completion, both groups will receive coaching calls over 9 months, beginning with 8 weekly calls followed by 4 monthly calls to encourage use of the educational materials. Primary outcome measures include feasibility (recruitment and retention) and acceptability (attendance). Secondary measures assess caregiver stress (Perceived Stress Scale), QOL, and self-care behaviors (Food Frequency Questionnaire and self-reported physical activity). Data collection occurs at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, CIs, and mediation models.
RESULTS: This study was approved by the institutional review board in April 2022 and funded in May 2022. The first data were collected in January 2023, and the last data were collected in September 2024. The completion of all aims' data analysis is anticipated in spring 2025. The participants' mean age was 62.4 (SD 7.98) years, with a mean baseline systolic BP of 128 (SD 19) mm Hg and diastolic BP of 79 (SD 10) mm Hg. Participants reported that MIM DASH was acceptable (at a mean score of 59.08, SD 7.38, compared to 60.83, SD 5.56 for caregiver training). Regarding feasibility, as reflected in attendance, MIM DASH participants had a mean attendance of 6.3 (SD 2.3) sessions, and the caregiver training group had 4.9 (SD 2.9) sessions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings demonstrate the feasibility of conducting an internet-based intervention (MIM DASH) for African American women with hypertension who also care for families living with ADRD.

40067065,Improving Respite Outcomes for Caregivers: Who Benefits and Under What Conditions?,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) pose a substantial caregiving burden in the United States, yet efforts to improve caregiver well-being have seen mixed results. We ask whether an app-based intervention (N = 143) to prioritize caregiver respite can substantially improve the caregiving experience, and whether these benefits are moderated by (1) caregiver demographics and (2) conditions of the caregiving situation (such as baseline impairment). Constructing curvilinear growth models to assess changes over a 20-week period, we find significant improvements in the positive aspects of caregiving (PAC). Greater benefits accrue to women, lower-income households, caregivers with a college degree, and caregivers who provide ≥80% of care to their family member. No differences in PAC growth are detected for care recipient memory and behavior problems, caregiver age, or caregiver race. We conclude that efforts to improve caregiver well-being may be especially effective for disadvantaged groups, with the notable exception of educational attainment.",J Appl Gerontol
39998604,DNA methylation patterns contribute to changes of cellular differentiation pathways in leukocytes with LOY from patients with Alzheimer´s disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and increasing societal problem due to the extending human lifespan. In males, loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is strongly associated with AD. We studied here DNA methylation and RNA expression in sorted monocytes and granulocytes with and without LOY from male AD patients. Through multi-omic analysis, we identified new candidate genes along with those previously associated with AD. Global analyses of DNA methylation in samples with LOY vs. normal state showed that hypomethylation dominated both in granulocytes and monocytes. Our findings highlight LOY-related differences in DNA methylation that occur in gene regulatory regions. Specifically, we observed alterations in key genes involved in leukocyte differentiation: FLI1, involved in early hematopoiesis; RUNX1, essential for blood cell development; RARA, regulating gene expression in response to retinoic acid; CANX, crucial for protein folding; CEBPB, a transcription factor important for immune responses; and MYADM, implicated in cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, protein-protein interaction analysis in granulocytes identified that products of two of these genes, CANX and CEBPB, are key hub proteins. This research underscores the potential of multi-omic approach in pure hematopoietic cell populations to uncover the molecular underpinnings of AD. Finally, our results link previous analysis showing impact of LOY on leukocyte differentiation, LOY-associated transcriptional dysregulation and GWAS studies of LOY.",Cell Mol Life Sci
40078900,Growth-Associated Protein 43 Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Correspond to the Cerebral Blood Flow Alterations in Alzheimer's Dementia Continuum: An Original Study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition that has a growing impact on a global scale. This study aims to examine the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the synaptic biomarker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) through the utilization of arterial spin labeling (ASL). The research identified noteworthy correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels, CBF, and cognitive composite scores, especially among participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who possess the APOE-ε4 gene.
METHODS: The study examined 92 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 36 cognitively normal (CN) and 56 MCI. The cognitive status of 42 participants was evaluated using ADNI composite scores. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used for the comparison of continuous variables between groups, and multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for confounding factors was used to assess the relationship between GAP-43 and CBF values.
RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were observed between GAP-43 levels and (A) the executive function composite score (ADNI_EF) in CN individuals, as well as (B) the language composite score (ADNI_LAN) in individuals with MCI. CSF biomarkers and ASL regions did not show statistical significance between diagnostic groups after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between diagnostic groups. However, associations were observed between ROI CBF and Mini Mental State Examination in various subgroups.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a potential function for ASL perfusion in identifying early AD-related alterations and gaining insight into the pathophysiology of AD and mild cognitive impairment.The study revealed associations between CBF, cognitive scores, and APOE-ε4 gene status. This study contributes to the comprehension of the correlation between CSF biomarkers, regional brain perfusion, and cognitive function in individuals with AD using ASL as a noninvasive approach.",Health Sci Rep
40073856,The annual incidence of vascular dementia and other dementias: A population-based study in Eastern Finland.,"INTRODUCTION: Considering the globally growing population and the rising incidence of dementia, it is important to understand the proportion of dementia cases affected by vascular brain disease. We aimed to study the incidence of vascular dementia (VD) and other dementias in a defined population in Finland to better understand VD's contribution to the total incidence of dementias and to assess the sensitivity of their diagnostics.
METHODS: We aimed to collect all dementia diagnoses made in Northern Savo, Finland, in 2020. The memory disorder diagnoses were identified using the International Classification Codes 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses codes. Finally, we studied the diagnoses in relation to demographic data, focusing on VD.
RESULTS: The total number of new diagnoses of dementia with a vascular component or vascular alone was 202, with 20 cases attributable to pure VD. The annual incidence of dementias with a vascular component in Northern Savo was 81.4 per 100,000 across the population and 310.8 per 100,000 in the age group of  65. In our study population, 23.8% of all incident dementia cases were associated with vascular disease.
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, dementia associated with vascular pathology has the second highest incidence after Alzheimer's disease (AD), while pure VD is rarely diagnosed. Our findings align with previous international studies and a recent national registry study. Future studies with a prospective study setting, potentially incorporating extensive neuroimaging, would be critical in further understanding the epidemiology of VD.",Neuroepidemiology
40159989,"Structural and metabolic topological alterations associated with butylphthalide treatment in mild cognitive impairment: Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","AIMS: Effective intervention for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is key for preventing dementia. As a neuroprotective agent, butylphthalide has the potential to treat MCI due to Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the pharmacological mechanism of butylphthalide from the brain network perspective is not clear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the multimodal brain network changes associated with butylphthalide treatment in MCI due to AD.
METHODS: A total of 270 patients with MCI due to AD received either butylphthalide or placebo at a ratio of 1:1 for 1 year. Effective treatment was defined as a decrease in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) > 2.5. Brain networks were constructed using T1-magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. A support vector machine was applied to develop predictive models.
RESULTS: Both treatment (drug vs. placebo)-time interactions and efficacy (effective vs. ineffective)-time interactions were detected on some overlapping structural network metrics. Simple effects analyses revealed a significantly increased global efficiency in the structural network under both treatment and effective treatment of butylphthalide. Among the overlapping metrics, an increased degree centrality of left paracentral lobule was significantly related to poorer cognitive improvement. The predictive model based on baseline multimodal network metrics exhibited high accuracy (88.93%) of predicting butylphthalide's efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Butylphthalide may restore abnormal organization in structural networks of patients with MCI due to AD, and baseline network metrics could be predictive markers for therapeutic efficacy of butylphthalide.

40128538,Caregiver burden of Alzheimer's disease among informal caregivers: a cross-sectional study in Malaysia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) not only impacts the patients but substantially informal caregivers in terms of physical and psychological burden. This study aims to determine the burden level of informal caregivers of patients with different stages of AD and use of special accommodation (SpA) along with its predictors. A cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing AD patients and informal caregivers recruited from 4 tertiary hospitals. Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) was used to estimate caregivers' burden. The analysis categorized informal caregivers of AD patients into two groups based on the use of SpA. Multivariable linear regression was employed to identify potential determinants of subjective caregiver burden. As a result, caregivers' burden experienced by informal caregivers of severe community-dwelling AD patients was significantly higher (p = 0.024) than those with special accommodation. As AD advanced, caregivers' burden was elevated significantly (p = 0.021) from mild to severe AD among community-dwelling patients. In multivariable analysis, severe AD (standardised β = 0.187, p = 0.047 vs. mild AD) and spousal relationship (standardised β = 0.241, p = 0.026 vs. other relationships) were found to be significant factors in predicting caregivers' burden. Hence, the physical and social needs of informal caregivers must not be overlooked. Severe AD significantly increased caregiver burden in community dwelling patients. Spousal caregivers report a higher perceived burden compared to caregivers with other relationships. Policymakers need to recognize and address the substantial demands placed on informal caregivers by providing essential social support. Special accommodation could alleviate the burden on informal caregivers, particularly those caring for patients with severe AD.",Sci Rep
40039777,Automated Offline Smartphone-Assisted Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Device for Biomarker Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.,"This paper presents a smartphone-assisted microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD), which was applied to detect Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, especially in resource-limited regions. This device implements deep learning (DL)-assisted offline smartphone detection, eliminating the requirement for large computing devices and cloud computing power. In addition, a smartphone-controlled rotary valve enables a fully automated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) on μPADs. It reduces detection errors caused by human operation and further increases the accuracy of μPAD c-ELISA. We realized a sandwich c-ELISA targeting β-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Aβ 1-42) in artificial plasma, and our device provided a detection limit of 15.07 pg/mL. We collected 750 images for the training of the DL YOLOv5 model. The training accuracy is 88.5%, which is 11.83% higher than the traditional curve-fitting result analysis method. Utilizing the YOLOv5 model with the NCNN framework facilitated offline detection directly on the smartphone.

40025702,Top-Down Proteomic Profiling of Protein Corona by High-Throughput Capillary Isoelectric Focusing-Mass Spectrometry.,"In the rapidly evolving field of nanomedicine, understanding the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems is crucial. A pivotal aspect of these interactions is the formation of a protein corona when NPs are exposed to biological fluids (e.g., human plasma), which significantly influences their behavior and functionality. This study introduces an advanced capillary isoelectric focusing tandem mass spectrometry (cIEF-MS/MS) platform designed to enable high-throughput and reproducible top-down proteomic analysis of protein corona. Our cIEF-MS/MS technique completed each analysis within 30 min. It produced reproducible proteoform measurements of protein corona for at least 50 runs regarding the proteoforms' migration time [relative standard deviations (RSDs) <4%], the proteoforms' intensity (Pearson's correlation coefficients between any two runs >0.90), the number of proteoform identifications (71 ± 10), and the number of proteoform-spectrum matches (PrSMs) (196 ± 30). Of the 53 identified genes, 33 are potential biomarkers of various diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease). We identified 1-102 proteoforms per potential protein biomarker, containing various sequence variations or post-translational modifications. Delineating proteoforms in protein corona by our cIEF-MS/MS in a reproducible and high-throughput fashion will benefit our understanding of nanobiointeractions and advance both diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine technologies.",J Am Soc Mass Spectrom
40033432,Applying machine learning to high-dimensional proteomics datasets for the identification of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"PURPOSE: This study explores the application of machine learning to high-dimensional proteomics datasets for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. AD, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, necessitates early and accurate diagnosis for effective management.
METHODS: We leverage Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics data from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the frontal cortex of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a condition often comorbid with AD, with rare access to both lumbar and ventricular samples. Our methodology includes extensive data preprocessing to address batch effects and missing values, followed by the use of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation to overcome the small sample size. We apply linear, and non-linear machine learning models, and ensemble methods, to compare iNPH patients with and without biomarker evidence of AD pathology ( A β - T -   or A β + T +   ) in a classification task.
RESULTS: We present a machine learning workflow for working with high-dimensional TMT proteomics data that addresses their inherent data characteristics. Our results demonstrate that batch effect correction has no or minor impact on the models' performance and robust feature selection is critical for model stability and performance, especially in the high-dimensional proteomics data setting for AD diagnostics. The results further indicated that removing features with missing values produced stronger models than imputing them, and the batch effect had minimal impact on the models Our best-performing disease-progression detection model, a random forest, achieves an AUC of 0.84 (± 0.03).
CONCLUSION: We identify several novel protein biomarkers candidates, such as FABP3 and GOT1, with potential diagnostic value for AD pathology detection, suggesting the necessity of different biomarkers for AD diagnoses for patients with iNPH, and considering different biomarkers for ventricular and lumbar CSF samples. This work underscores the importance of a meticulous machine learning process in enhancing biomarker discovery. Our study also provides insights in translating biomarkers from other central nervous system diseases like iNPH, and both ventricular and lumbar CSF samples for biomarker discovery, providing a foundation for future research and clinical applications.",Fluids Barriers CNS
40151895,The relationship between Alzheimer's disease and intracerebral hemorrhage based on Mendelian randomization.,"BackgroundTraditional epidemiologic studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).ObjectiveTo explore whether there is a causal relationship between AD and ICH and the underlying mechanisms involved.MethodsMendelian randomization (MR) approach was used to explore causal relationships. The genetic instrumental variables of the candidate genetic instrumental variable AD were obtained from genome-wide association studies. The inverse variance weighted method was the primary method for MR analysis and meta-analysis. The obtained single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed for corresponding genes for subsequent pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis.ResultsFor the single AD dataset, our MR analysis of the AD datasets versus the ICH datasets revealed a genetically predicted causal relationship between AD and ICH (OR 5.947, 95%CI 1.165-30.356, p<sub>IVW </sub>= 0.032). In addition, the MR-Egger method and MR-PRESSO method revealed no horizontal pleiotropic effect of AD on the risk of ICH. Meta-analysis of each dataset using IVW revealed a final calculated OR of 1.08 (95%CI 1.02-1.15, p = 0.01). Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the corresponding genes were involved mainly in the metabolic process of amyloid-β (Aβ) and negatively regulated Aβ formation. In the PPI network analysis, proteins such as ApoE, SROL1, CLU, ABCA7, and AβPP were found to be closely related and located in the key position of the center.ConclusionsWe verified the causal relationship between AD and ICH via MR, and identified the possible pathological mechanisms involved. We also discovered that Aβ plays an important role in this process.",J Alzheimers Dis
39976083,"The TIE-93: a Facial Emotion Recognition Test Adapted for Culturally, Linguistically, and Educationally Diverse Alzheimer's Dementia Patients in France.","OBJECTIVE: Emotion recognition tests are essential for differential diagnostics when assessing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, there remains a lack of emotion recognition tests appropriate for culturally and educationally diverse populations. The aim of this study was to develop an emotion recognition test (the TIE-93) appropriate for these populations. We then examined whether the TIE-93 could reduce emotion recognition performance differences between populations with a native French versus a culturally and educationally diverse background (participants who had immigrated to France). This was assessed by comparing performance between controls of each cultural group. We also assessed the effect of demographic variables on TIE-93 test performance and whether performance in an AD patient group was consistent with the research literature.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with AD dementia and 240 healthy controls, from native French and culturally and educationally diverse backgrounds, were included in the study. The TIE-93 is composed of eight panels with photos of actors displaying six basic emotions. Participants were asked to identify which of the six facial expressions displayed matched an oral description of a context.
RESULTS: When comparing French and culturally and educationally diverse controls, Quade's ANCOVA revealed that there remained an effect of culture and education on TIE-93 test performance. Nonetheless, while controlling for years of education, age, sex, and cultural group, patients with AD dementia scored significantly more poorly than controls, specifically for most negative emotions.
CONCLUSION: The TIE-93 represents a first step toward developing appropriate emotion recognition tests for culturally and educationally diverse populations.",Arch Clin Neuropsychol
40033713,A retrospective analysis of ultrasound neuromodulation therapy using transcranial pulse stimulation in 58 dementia patients.,"BACKGROUND: Novel ultrasound neuromodulation techniques allow therapeutic brain stimulation with unmet precision and non-invasive targeting of deep brain areas. Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS), a multifrequency sonication technique, is approved for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we present the largest real-world retrospective analysis of ultrasound neuromodulation therapy in dementia (AD, vascular, mixed) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The consecutive sample involved 58 patients already receiving state-of-the-art treatment in an open-label, uncontrolled, retrospective study. TPS therapy typically comprises 10 sessions (range 8-12) with individualized MRI-based target areas defined according to brain pathology and individual pathophysiology. We compared the CERAD-Plus neuropsychological test battery results before and after treatment, with the CERAD Corrected Total Score ( CTS) as the primary outcome. Furthermore, we analyzed side effects reported by patients during the treatment period.
RESULTS: CERAD Corrected Total Score (CTS) significantly improved (p = .017, d = .32) after treatment (Baseline: M = 56.56, SD = 18.56; Post-treatment: M = 58.65, SD = 19.44). The group of top-responders (top quartile) improved even by 9.8 points. Fewer than one-third of all patients reported any sensation during treatment. Fatigue and transient headaches were the most common, with no severe adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate TPS as a novel and safe add-on therapy for patients with dementia or MCI with the potential to further improve current state-of-the-art treatment results. Despite the individual benefits, further randomized, sham-controlled, longitudinal clinical trials are needed to differentiate the effects of verum and placebo.",Psychol Med
40040665,PVTAD: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DIAGNOSIS USING PYRAMID VISION TRANSFORMER APPLIED TO WHITE MATTER OF T1-WEIGHTED STRUCTURAL MRI DATA.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and timely diagnosis is crucial for early interventions. AD is known to have disruptive local and global brain neural connections that may be instrumental in understanding and extracting specific biomarkers. Existing machine-learning approaches are mostly based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and standard vision transformer (ViT) models, which may not sufficiently capture the multidimensional local and global patterns indicative of AD. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called PVTAD to classify AD and cognitively normal (CN) cases using pretrained pyramid vision transformer (PVT) and white matter (WM) of T1-weighted structural MRI (sMRI) data. Our approach combines the advantages of CNN and standard ViT to extract both local and global features indicative of AD from the WM coronal middle slices. We performed experiments on subjects with T1-weighed MPRAGE sMRI scans from the ADNI dataset. Our results demonstrate that the PVTAD achieves an average accuracy of 97.7% and an F1-score of 97.6%, outperforming the single and parallel CNN and standard ViT based on sMRI data for AD vs. CN classification.

40120777,A red lentils-based synbiotic cookie exerts neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"SCOPE: Gut microbiota preservation or rational manipulation is a key condition for healthy longevity and a promising strategy to prevent neurodegenerations exploiting the gut-brain axis, with a key role of prebiotics and probiotics. Whether their combination in a functional food can provide a synergistic effect to the host remains controversial.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To fill this gap, we supplemented the diet of 3xTg-AD Alzheimer's disease mice with a red lentils (prebiotic)-based cookie enriched with neuroprotective probiotics and we performed behavioural, biochemical and molecular tests. Chronic consumption of this synbiotic preparation (functional cookie) preserved cognition, reduced amyloid load, improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and diminished oxidation and inflammation related damages compared to animals receiving a classic cookie (standard recipe). The synergistic effect was indicated by significantly higher glucose insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations in the functional cookie group compared to probiotic group. Moreover, Ruminoclostridium sp KB18 and Ruminicoccus decreased in the gut of mice supplemented with the functional cookie, partially explaining the improved short-term memory upon treatments and substantiating the combined use over individual components.
CONCLUSION: This synbiotic innovative snack represents a prototype of a simple and affordable dietary approach to promote healthy aging and prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerations.",J Nutr Biochem
40096820,The blood-brain barrier as a treatment target for neurodegenerative disorders.,"INTRODUCTION: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a vascular endothelial membrane which restricts entry of toxins, cells, and microorganisms into the brain. At the same time, the BBB supplies the brain with nutrients, key substrates for DNA and RNA synthesis, and regulatory molecules, and removes metabolic waste products from brain to blood. BBB breakdown and/or dysfunction have been shown in neurogenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current data suggests that these BBB changes may initiate and/or contribute to neuronal, synaptic, and cognitive dysfunction, and possibly other aspects of neurodegenerative processes.
AREAS COVERED: We first briefly review recent studies uncovering molecular composition of brain microvasculature and examine the BBB as a possible therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders with a focus on AD. Current strategies aimed at protecting and/or restoring altered BBB functions are considered. The relevance of BBB-directed approaches to improve neuronal and synaptic function, and to slow progression of neurodegenerative processes are also discussed. Lastly, we review recent advancements in drug delivery across the BBB.
EXPERT OPINION: BBB breakdown and/or dysfunction can significantly affect neuronal and synaptic function and neurodegenerative processes. More attention should focus on therapeutics to preserve or restore BBB functions when considering treatments of neurodegenerative diseases and AD.",Expert Opin Drug Deliv
40004143,Graph and Multi-Level Sequence Fusion Learning for Predicting the Molecular Activity of BACE-1 Inhibitors.,"The development of BACE-1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) inhibitors is a crucial focus in exploring early treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant advantages in predicting molecular activity. However, their reliance on graph structures alone often neglects explicit sequence-level semantic information. To address this limitation, we proposed a Graph and multi-level Sequence Fusion Learning (GSFL) model for predicting the molecular activity of BACE-1 inhibitors. Firstly, molecular graph structures generated from SMILES strings were encoded using GNNs with an atomic-level characteristic attention mechanism. Next, substrings at functional group, ion level, and atomic level substrings were extracted from SMILES strings and encoded using a BiLSTM-Transformer framework equipped with a hierarchical attention mechanism. Finally, these features were fused to predict the activity of BACE-1 inhibitors. A dataset of 1548 compounds with BACE-1 activity measurements was curated from the ChEMBL database. In the classification experiment, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.941 on the training set and 0.877 on the test set. For the test set, it delivered a sensitivity of 0.852, a specificity of 0.894, a MCC of 0.744, an F1-score of 0.872, a PRC of 0.869, and an AUC of 0.915. Compared to traditional computer-aided drug design methods and other machine learning algorithms, the proposed model can effectively improve the accuracy of the molecular activity prediction of BACE-1 inhibitors and has a potential application value.",Int J Mol Sci
40155425,A novel method for estimating functional connectivity from EEG coherence potentials.,"Analysis of functional connectivity can provide insights into how the brain performs various cognitive and behavioral tasks as well as the neural mechanisms underlying several pathologies. In this work, we describe a novel approach to estimate functional connectivity from electroencephalography (EEG) data using the concept of coherence potentials (CPs), which are defined as clusters of high-amplitude deflections with similar waveform shapes. We define connectivity measures based on features of CPs, including the time intervals between CP peaks and their co-occurrence on different electrodes or channels. We used EEG data from 25 healthy subjects performing three tasks - resting state (eyes closed and eyes open), working memory and pattern completion tasks to investigate the ability of CP based connectivity measures to distinguish between these tasks. When compared with traditional connectivity measures including several spectral-based measures and mutual information, our results showed that CP based connectivity measures more robustly and significantly distinguished between all the tasks both at group-level and subject-level. In conclusion, CP based EEG connectivity measures provide a reliable way to distinguish between different cognitive task conditions and could pave way in the early detection of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease that affect various cognitive tasks.",Sci Rep
39990823,[Radiological Identification and Evaluation of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease].,"Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), intracranial signal abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), represent one of the main adverse events associated with treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) with anti-amyloid-β (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases, patients' lives may be threatened. As the first anti-Aβ antibody was approved for use in China, clinical departments are now confronted with an increased likelihood of encountering ARIA in real-world scenarios. Accurate pre-treatment risk assessment, timely identification during medication, and severity evaluation of ARIA are of great significance in guiding clinical decisions. The identification and assessment of ARIA can be conducted from two perspectives-imaging and clinical symptoms. This article focuses on imaging. We reviewed the pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and imaging protocols and assessment of ARIA. We also stated at the end of the review that most current research data on ARIA came from clinical drug trials involving Caucasian populations, and that there was a lack of treatment experience in the real-world application of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in Chinese populations. Many issues concerning pre-treatment risk assessment still need to be explored. Additionally, whether there are other clinical factors and imaging indicators that can help predict drug risks, and whether using different imaging protocols can help make a difference in patient management in the real world all require further investigation.",Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban

This study investigates the potential of gold nanoparticles loaded with afzelin, a natural chemical extracted from Ribes fasciculatum, to enhance its therapeutic effects and overcome the limitations of using natural compounds regarding low productivity. We hypothesized that the combined treatment of AuNPs with afzelin (AuNP-afzelin) would remarkably enforce neuroprotective effects compared with the single treatment of afzelin. Central administration of AuNP-afzelin (10 ng of afzelin) indicated improvements in cognition and memory-involved assessments of behavioral tests, comparing single treatments of afzelin (10 or 100 ng of afzelin) in scopolamine-induced AD mice. AuNP-afzelin also performed superior neuroprotective effects of rescuing mature neuronal cells and recovered cholinergic dysfunction compared to afzelin alone, according to further investigations of BDNF-pCREB-pAkt signaling, long-term potentiation, and doublecortin (DCX) expression in the hippocampus.

40151398,Optimized 5-HT<sub>2b</sub> inhibitors for neuropsychiatric syndromes with cognitive dysfunction.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric syndromes such as anxiety and agitation are clinical presentations common to diverse neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury sequelae. They are a concern due to the impact on cognition, social interactions, and non-pharmacological treatments. Cognitive or behavioral disturbances occur at early disease stages and increase with disease progression. Coincident pathologies include the loss of serotonin (5-HT) neurons and appearance of neurofibrillary tangles in the raphe nucleus. Brain 5-HT<sub>2b</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R) levels are increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and post-stroke morbidity. HTR2B gene variants are implicated in psychiatric disorders. 5-HTRs are associated with atypical neurotropic drug mechanisms and behavioral dysfunction in drug abuse. The accumulating body of evidence suggests that selective 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R inhibition might mitigate neuropsychiatric syndromes and the associated cognitive dysfunction. Atypical neurotropic drugs interact with a variety of monoamine receptors and outcomes are viewed as a combination of 5-HT and dopamine D2 receptor mediated actions. Clearly, there is a need for insight into precision 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R inhibition as a potential pharmacological mechanism for treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes and cognitive dysfunction associated with dementia.
METHODS: Strategic optimization of an atypical neurotropic drug was used to develop MW073, a highly selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity and β-arrestin-1 recruitment that is devoid of dopamine receptor recognition and risk of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R agonist activity.
RESULTS: MW073 ameliorates amyloid and tau induction of behavioral dysfunction in preventive or disease stage intervention paradigms. Using MW073 as a standard of comparison, risperidone was shown to be a dose-dependent inhibitor 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity and β-arrestin-1 recruitment.
DISCUSSION: Selective inhibition of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity is a viable mechanism for the treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes with synaptic dysfunction as a root cause and is a previously unrealized pharmacodynamic mechanism potentially embedded in current neurotherapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: A new highly selective 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist, MW073, is described and used as a reference standard.MW073 attenuates synaptic and behavioral dysfunctions an animal models of neuropsychatric syndromes.Risperidone is a dose dependent inhibitor of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity and arrestin recruitment.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40009053,Slowed Driving Reaction Time in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.,"Driving reaction time (DRT) is one of the most important predictors of motor vehicle crashes in older adults. Although individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) show subtle cognitive changes that may affect driving, their DRT to emergency events has not been investigated. We compared DRT to an emergency event between 19 drivers with preclinical AD and 21 controls in a driving simulator. All drivers engaged in a car-following task with and without distracters. After the car-following event, a crash prompted participants to brake and maneuver around the accident scene. Drivers with preclinical AD took longer to respond to the emergency event compared to controls when they were not distracted by an additional task (7.56 ± 1.46 s v 6.42 ± 1.17 s; p = .02). There were no group differences when a distraction was added to the car-following task. These pilot results have important implications on driving safety for older adults with preclinical AD when confirmed in larger on-road studies.",J Appl Gerontol
40037561,Common occurrence of atrophic gastritis in an ageing non-hospitalised population: an autopsy study.,"BACKGROUND: Atrophic gastritis-the end stage of chronic gastritis-is an asymptomatic disease due to Helicobacter pylori infection causing decreased vitamin B12 and folate absorption, which may lead to severe haematological and neuropsychological disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis requires endoscopy and biopsies from symptomatic patients, explaining why its true prevalence in the population is not well-known.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of various stages of chronic gastritis in an autopsy series most closely representing the general population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Gastric mucosa samples were collected prospectively from out-of-hospital deaths included in the Tampere Sudden Death Study (n = 70, mean age 63, age range 22-91 years). Antrum and corpus samples were stained with a H. pylori antibody and staged histopathologically.
RESULTS: Chronic gastritis with or without atrophic changes was detected in 40% of the cases. The proportion of healthy mucosa decreased age-dependently from 71.4% among individuals aged <50 years to 43.5% among the oldest individuals (>70 years), and that of chronic non-atrophic gastritis from 21.4% to 8.7%. In contrast, the prevalence of atrophic gastritis was 27.1% and increased in the age groups from 7.1% to 47.8% (P = .019) among the oldest individuals, showing a strong association (P < .0001) with H. pylori immunopositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic gastritis is a common feature of the ageing stomach, which is observed in every second individual aged 70+ years, showing a strong association with H. pylori immunopositivity. Atrophic gastritis may be a more common risk factor in old age for diseases associated with low serum B12 and folate levels than has been previously known.",Age Ageing
40147216,Class balancing diversity multimodal ensemble for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and early detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant global health challenges due to its increasing prevalence and associated societal costs. Early detection and diagnosis of AD are critical for delaying progression and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods and single-modality data often fall short in identifying early-stage AD and distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach: multImodal enseMble via class BALancing diversity for iMbalancEd Data (IMBALMED). IMBALMED integrates multimodal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including clinical assessments, neuroimaging phenotypes, biospecimen, and subject characteristics data. It employs a new ensemble of model classifiers, designed specifically for this framework, which combines eight distinct families of learning paradigms trained with diverse class balancing techniques to overcome class imbalance and enhance model accuracy. We evaluate IMBALMED on two diagnostic tasks (binary and ternary classification) and four binary early detection tasks (at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months), comparing its performance with state-of-the-art algorithms and an unbalanced dataset method. To further validate the proposed model and ensure genuine generalization to real-world scenarios, we conducted an external validation experiment using data from the most recent phase of the ADNI dataset. IMBALMED demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and predictive performance in both binary and ternary classification tasks, significantly improving early detection of MCI at a 48-month time point and showing excellent generalizability in the 12-month task during external validation. The method shows improved classification performance and robustness, offering a promising solution for early detection and management of AD.",Comput Med Imaging Graph
40000575,Role of Peripheral NLRP3 Inflammasome in Cognitive Impairments: Insights of Non-central Factors.,"Cognitive impairments are common clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases. Emerging evidence has suggested a strong correlation between peripheral chronic inflammation and cognitive impairments. For example, nearly 40% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease also suffer from cognitive impairments. In this condition, NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3-I) generating pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β serves as a significant effector, and its persistence exerts adverse effects to both periphery and the brain. Moreover, investigations on serum biomarkers of mild cognitive impairments have shown NLRP3-I components' upregulation, suggesting the involvement of peripheral inflammasome pathway in this disorder. Here, we systematically reviewed the current knowledge of NLRP3-I in inflammatory disease to uncover its potential role in bridging peripheral chronic inflammation and cognitive impairments. This review summarizes the molecular features and ignition process of NLRP3-I in inflammatory response. Meanwhile, various effects of NLRP3-I involved in peripheral inflammation-associated disease are also reviewed, especially its chronic disturbances to brain homeostasis and cognitive function through routes including gut-brain, liver-brain, and kidney-brain axes. In addition, current promising compounds and their targets relative to NLRP3-I are discussed in the context of cognitive impairments. Through the detailed investigation, this review highlights the critical role of peripheral NLRP3-I in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders, and offers novel perspectives for developing effective therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with cognitive impairments. The present review outlines the current knowledge on the ignition of NLRP3-I in inflammatory disease and more importantly, emphasizes the role of peripheral NLRP3-I as a causal pathway in the development of cognitive disorders. Although major efforts to restrain cognitive decline are mainly focused on the central nervous system, it has become clear that disturbances from peripheral immune are closely associated with the dysfunctional brain. Therefore, attenuation of these inflammatory changes through inhibiting the NLRP3-I pathway in early inflammatory disease may reduce future risk of cognitive impairments, and in the meantime, considerations on such pathogenesis for combined drug therapy will be required in the clinical evaluation of cognitive disorders.",Mol Neurobiol
39978053,Alpha rhythm and Alzheimer's disease: Has Hans Berger's dream come true?,"In this ""centenary"" paper, an expert panel revisited Hans Berger's groundbreaking discovery of human restingstate electroencephalographic (rsEEG) alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) in 1924, his foresight of substantial clinical applications in patients with ""senile dementia,"" and new developments in the field, focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia in pathological aging. Clinical guidelines issued in 2024 by the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) and the European Neuroscience Societies did not endorse routine use of rsEEG biomarkers in the clinical workup of older adults with cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the expert panel highlighted decades of research from independent workgroups and different techniques showing consistent evidence that abnormalities in rsEEG delta, theta, and alpha rhythms (< 30 Hz) observed in AD patients correlate with wellestablished AD biomarkers of neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. We posit that these abnormalities may reflect alterations in oscillatory synchronization within subcortical and cortical circuits, inducing cortical inhibitory-excitatory imbalance (in some cases leading to epileptiform activity) and vigilance dysfunctions (e.g., mental fatigue and drowsiness), which may impact AD patients' quality of life. Berger's vision of using EEG to understand and manage dementia in pathological aging is still actual.",Clin Neurophysiol
40148444,A personalized metabolic modelling approach through integrated analysis of RNA-Seq-based genomic variants and gene expression levels in Alzheimer's disease.,"Generating condition-specific metabolic models by mapping gene expression data to genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) is a routine approach to elucidate disease mechanisms from a metabolic perspective. On the other hand, integrating variants that perturb enzyme functionality from the same RNA-seq data may enhance GEM accuracy, offering insights into genome-wide metabolic pathology. Our study pioneers the extraction of both transcriptomic and genomic data from the same RNA-seq data to reconstruct personalized metabolic models. We map genes with significantly higher load of pathogenic variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onto a human GEM together with the gene expression data. Comparative analysis of the resulting personalized patient metabolic models with the control models shows enhanced accuracy in detecting AD-associated metabolic pathways compared to the case where only expression data is mapped on the GEM. Besides, several otherwise would-be missed pathways are annotated in AD by considering the effect of genomic variants.",Commun Biol

In a health-economic model, the cost-effectiveness of three diagnostic strategies was estimated relying either on BBM (p-tau 217), CSF (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio), and BBM with CSF confirmatory testing and compared with standard of care (SoC) and compared with CSF-AAT. The model consisted of a decision tree reflecting the diagnostic process and a subsequent Markov cohort model starting at mild cognitive impairment due to AD. All strategies except SoC were combined with AAT including costs of treatment (assumed €5000/year), infusions and monitoring.ResultsCompared with SoC all three strategies (CSF-AAT, BBM-AAT, and BBM-CSF-AAT) resulted in QALY gains at higher costs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 110k€, 141k€ and 110k€ respectively. Compared with CSF-AAT both BBM-AAT and BBM-CSF-AAT strategies resulted in QALYs lost at lower costs, with an ICER of 27k€ and 109k€ respectively. Results were particularly sensitive to the price of AAT and possible subcutaneous administration.ConclusionsCompared with SoC all three strategies are potentially not cost-effective as they exceeded the Swedish maximum willingness to pay threshold of €94,800 per QALY gained. BBM-CSF-AAT versus CSF-AAT is potentially cost-effective if willing to accept its QALY loss. Discussions on budget impact on different payers are needed after introducing AAT.",J Alzheimers Dis
40086974,Probiotic-fermented ginger-processed Gastrodia elata BI. Ameliorates AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced cognitive dysfunction in an Alzheimer's disease rat model by regulating the gut microbiota and CREB/BDNF pathway.,"Gastrodia elata BI., which is an edible plant, has been reported in previous studies to possess a strong capacity for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study focuses on ginger-processed and fermented Gastrodia elata BI. (FGGE) to investigate its effects on behaviour, brain neuroregulation, and the gut microbiota in an AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced AD rat model, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Results indicate that FGGE significantly improved novel object recognition and the correct alternation rate in the Y-maze test for AD rats. In addition, FGGE alleviated brain oxidative stress and restored the anti-inflammatory response, cholinergic function, and tissue morphology in the hippocampus. Furthermore, FGGE activated the cAMP response element-binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor signalling pathway, reversing neural network abnormalities and enhancing neural regulation. FGGE also promoted the proliferation of bacteria negatively associated with AD, such as Methanosphaera and Lactobacillus, thereby restoring gut microbiota balance. The mechanisms by which FGGE alleviates AD may involve the modulation of the gut-brain axis, ultimately mitigating AD symptoms. FGGE represents an innovative functional food with significant therapeutic potential and promising application prospects.",Food Res Int
40016477,"[Observational study on the coincidence of Alzheimer's disease and idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: analysis of coincidence, the influence on response to cerebrospinal fluid drainage and cerebrovascular copathology].","OBJECTIVE: Analysis of the frequency of comorbid Alzheimer's disease in patients with suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and its effects on the response to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage as well as analysis of the frequency of a vascular copathology in patients with suspected iNPH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational analysis of patients with suspected iNPH who underwent guideline-conform NPH routine diagnostics including CSF drainage during clinical routine diagnostics between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 2023. Patients were recruited via the departments of neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry of the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Dresden. Typical NPH imaging results were acquired from available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) sectional images. Relevant sociodemographic, clinical, cognitive and CSF diagnostic parameters were acquired via patient chart review. The patients were categorized with respect to the CSF results according to the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) classification.
RESULTS: During the observational period 33 patients (14 female, 19 male, mean age 74.6 ± 8.1 years) with suspected iNPH were analyzed. Of the patients 19 (57.6%) had a complete and 14 (42.4%) an incomplete Hakim's triad. The difference between the MoCA scores before and after CSF drainage varied between patients with and without a response to CSF drainage (F(1;22) = 5.725; p = 0.026). There was a trend that patients with a pathological corpus callosum angle and conspicuous Evans index (p = 0.052) as well as patients with a pathological corpus callosum angle, Evans index and complete clinical Hakim's triad (p = 0.055) more frequently show a response. The mean Fazekas score was 1.7. There was no correlation between the Fazekas score and response to CSF drainage. In 25 patients (75.8%) biomarkers for dementia and neurodegeneration were detected. According to the ATN classification 20 patients (80%) were categorized as A<sup>+</sup>T<sup>-</sup>, 3 (12.0%) as A<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> and 2 (8.0%) as A<sup>-</sup>T<sup>-</sup>. Patients classified as A<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> and A<sup>+</sup>T<sup>-</sup> did not respond more often to CSF drainage (p = 0.600).
CONCLUSION: The combined determination of the corpus callosum angle and the Evans index as well es their contextualization with clinical characteristics can possibly improve the prognostic evaluation regarding response to CSF draínage. Especially a comorbid amyloid pathology and a cerebral microangiopathy represent frequent copathologies of iNPH but the influence on the response to CSF drainage remains to be elucidated.",Nervenarzt
40080085,Genetic and circulating biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in CKD.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and dementia, which, in turn, increase the risk of hospitalization, cardiovascular events and death. Over the last 30 years, only four studies focused on genetic markers of cognitive impairment in CKD and kidney failure (KF), indicating a significant gap in research. These studies suggest potential genetic predispositions to cognitive decline in CKD patients but also underscore the necessity for more comprehensive studies. Seventeen reports have established connections between cognitive function and kidney disease markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), Cystatin C and albuminuria. A rapid eGFR decline has been associated with cognitive deterioration and vascular dementia, and mild to moderate eGFR reductions with diminished executive function in elderly men. Various biomarkers have been associated to Alzheimer's disease or dementia in CKD and KF. These include amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau proteins, uremic toxins, gut microbiota, metabolic indicators, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, vitamins and inflammation. However, the causal relevance of these associations remains unclear. Overall, the available evidence points to a complex interplay between the different biomarkers and cognitive health in CKD patients, underscoring the need for more research to elucidate these relationships.",Nephrol Dial Transplant
40111590,"Elevated CSF GAP-43 in Mild Cognitive Impairment Linked to Cognitive Impairment Through Increased Amyloid-β Accumulation, with a Shift to Reduced Amyloid-β Accumulation in Alzheimer's Disease.","Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, neuronal growth, and memory, has recently been identified as a crucial biomarker for synaptic dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying GAP-43's role in cognitive impairment by examining the relationship between CSF GAP-43 levels and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in brain regions like the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. This study included 332 participants sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), categorized into three groups: 93 cognitively normal (CN), 218 with MCI, and 21 with AD dementia. Cognitive status was assessed with ADAS-Cog 13, CSF GAP-43 levels via ELISA, and Aβ accumulation using florbetapir PET imaging and Syngo.PET for SUVr values in key brain regions. The results revealed that CSF GAP-43 levels were highest in the AD dementia group, followed by the MCI group, and lowest in the CN group, with a significant difference (p < 0.001), indicating a link between elevated CSF GAP-43 and cognitive impairment. In MCI group, CSF GAP-43 positively correlated with Aβ accumulation in all regions: Globally (β = 0.362, p < 0.001), frontal (β = 0.388, p < 0.001), temporal (β = 0.382, p < 0.001), and parietal lobes (β = 0.344, p < 0.001). In contrast, the AD dementia group exhibited negative correlations between CSF GAP-43 levels and Aβ accumulation, significantly in the frontal (β =  - 0.513, p = 0.035) and parietal lobes (β =  - 0.513, p = 0.035), suggesting a shift in the CSF GAP-43-Aβ relationship in AD dementia. Mediation analysis, adjusted for age, gender, education, and ApoE ɛ4 status, revealed that elevated CSF GAP-43 is linked to increased cognitive impairment via increasing Aβ accumulation solely in MCI, with significant effects in global (β = 0.0894, CI: [0.0427, 0.1457]), frontal (β = 0.0895, CI: [0.0422, 0.1443]), temporal (β = 0.0941, CI: [0.0466, 0.1522]), and parietal (β = 0.0499, CI: [0.0100, 0.0945]) regions. Thus, elevated CSF GAP-43 may contribute to cognitive impairment by promoting Aβ accumulation in individuals with MCI, while in AD dementia, it may be associated with reduced Aβ accumulation, potentially reflecting a compensatory or disease-stage-dependent effect. This dynamic relationship suggests that GAP-43 could play a dual role in neurodegeneration, influencing Aβ pathology differently across disease stages.",J Mol Neurosci
39994806,<sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 tau PET in patients at-risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Molecular biomarkers of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are lacking. We evaluated <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 tau PET as a biomarker for CTE. Two studies were done: (1) <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 autoradiography and an in-vitro brain homogenate binding studies on postmortem CTE tissue, (2) an in-vivo <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 tau PET study in former American football players.
METHODS: Autoradiography and in-vitro binding studies were done using <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 on frozen temporal and frontal cortex tissue from six autopsy cases with stage III CTE compared to Alzheimer's disease. Thirty male former National Football League (NFL) players with cognitive concerns (mean age = 58.9, SD = 7.8) completed tau (<sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240) and Aβ (<sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir) PET. Controls included 39 Aβ-PET negative, cognitively normal males (mean age = 65.7, SD = 6.3). <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 SUVr images were created using 70-90 min post-injection data with inferior cerebellar gray matter as the reference. We compared SUVr between players and controls using voxelwise and region-of-interest approaches. Correlations between <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 SUVr and cognitive scores were tested.
RESULTS: All six CTE stage III cases had Braak NFT stage III but no neuritic plaques. Two had Thal Phase 1 for Aβ; one showed a laminar pattern of <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 autoradiography binding in the superior temporal cortex and less so in the dorsolateral frontal cortex, corresponding to tau-immunoreactive lesions detected using the AT8 antibody (pSer202/pThr205 tau) in adjacent tissue sections. The other CTE cases had low frequencies of cortical tau-immunoreactive deposits and no well-defined autoradiography binding. In-vitro <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 binding studies to CTE brain homogenates in the case with autoradiography signal indicated high binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.0 ± 0.9 nM, B<sub>max</sub> = 97 ± 24 nM, n = 3). All NFL players had negative Aβ-PET. There was variable, low-to-intermediate intensity <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 uptake across participants: 16 had no cortical signal, 7 had medial temporal lobe (MTL) uptake, 2 had frontal uptake, and 4 had MTL and frontal uptake. NFL players had higher SUVr in the entorhinal cortex (d = 0.86, p = 0.001), and the parahippocampal gyrus (d = 0.39, p = 0.08). Voxelwise regressions showed increased uptake in NFL players in two bilateral anterior MTL clusters (p &lt; 0.05 FWE). Higher parahippocampal and frontal-temporal SUVrs correlated with worse memory (r = -0.38, r = -0.40) and semantic fluency (r = -0.38, r = -0.48), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We present evidence of <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 in-vitro binding to post-mortem CTE tissue homogenates and in vivo <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 PET binding in the MTL among a subset of participants. Additional studies in larger samples and PET-to-autopsy correlations are required to further elucidate the potential of <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 to detect tau pathology in CTE.",Mol Neurodegener
40080392,Molecular Mechanisms of Dietary Bioactive Peptides in Treating Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment by Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analysis.,"Emerging evidence suggests that bioactive peptides from various foods have therapeutic potentials in improving cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We aimed to explore the characteristics of these peptides and their mechanisms on AD/MCI using a network pharmacology approach. We compiled a dataset of cognition-enhancing peptides from literatures and identified shared targets between these peptides and AD/MCI using Swiss Target Predication, PharmMapper, OMIM, GeneCards, TTD, and Drugbank databases. We then performed functional enrichment analysis and constructed a gene-gene interaction network to identify key hub targets. Additionally, we investigated the transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating these hub genes. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations were performed using AutoDock Vina and GROMACS. We identified 59 cognition-enhancing oligopeptides, typically short and rich in arginine. These peptides were predicted to interact with 222 potential targets relevant to AD/MCI, with functional pathways mainly involving neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and inflammation. We identified 15 hub targets, regulated by 144 TFs and 95 miRNAs. Notably, peptides containing the ""Trp-Tyr"" sequence demonstrated strong binding affinities to many hub targets, especially matrix metalloproteinase-9. The findings provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms through which bioactive peptides may act against AD/MCI and highlight the potential of network pharmacology for future exploration of bioactive peptides from natural foods.",Rejuvenation Res

New studies revealed that microglia, the native immune cells in the brain, are crucial in the development of AD. The present review aims at outlining various roles of microglia in AD especially targeting their role in neuroinflammation. These indicate that microglial dysfunction contributes to AD pathology by affecting both amyloid-β phagocytosis and tau hyperphosphorylation. Other investigative molecular perpetrators, including TREM2, also influence the microglial relevance to amyloid and tau, as well as the overall disease phase. The functional microglia can protect neurons, while the dysfunctional one has the capability of derailing neuronal potentials and aggravating neurodegeneration. We have also discussed therapeutic strategies that start with targeting microglia to reduce neuroinflammation and reinstate balance. However, certain problems, including the side effects of microglial modulation, cost constraint, and accessibility, are areas of concern. In this review, the author presents the current state of knowledge on the potential of microglia-targeted treatments, their risks, and benefits. Thus, this article emphasizes the importance of the expansion of research to decipher the exact manipulation of microglia in AD with the goal of applying these findings given therapeutic approaches.",Curr Alzheimer Res
40056763,Bioactive peptides as multipotent molecules bespoke and designed for Alzheimer's disease.,"In an increasingly aging world where neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are exponentially rising, research into more effective and innovative treatments seems paramount. Bioactive peptides (BPs) emerge as promising compounds with revolutionary potential in the treatment of NDs, particularly in well-known conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological potential of these compounds is primarily attributed to their drug development advantages such as enhanced penetration, low toxicity, and rapid clearance, as well as, their antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties bio-linked to the neuroprotective effect, able to attenuate the multifactorial pathologies of AD. BPs can be sourced from common dietary origins, like animals, plants, marine, and from emerging sources like edible insects. However, to isolate an active BP with beneficial biological effects it must first be released from its parent protein, followed by a synthesis-flow. While in silico approaches can predict a BP's potential bioactivity and structural characteristics, in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo assays should be conducted to ensure these properties. The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) microenvironment and permeability in health or disease state are key factors to consider since they can limit the ability of circulating therapeutical agents, including BPs, to reach the brain. This review focuses on the bioactivity properties of BPs from different dietary protein sources and explores their beneficial effect and neuroprotective activity in AD, unraveling new paths of treatment.",Neuropeptides
40090398,PPM1D ameliorates Alzheimer's disease by promoting mitophagy.,"Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) plays an essential role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Defective mitophagy triggered by amyloid beta (Aβ) is linked to neuronal deterioration and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the defective mitophagy in AD is still not fully illustrated. Protein phosphatase Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 1D (PPM1D) triggers autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Downregulated PPM1D was shown in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. This study aims to investigate the role of PPM1D in the progression of AD. Here, APP/PS1 mice were used to mimic AD, and rAAV2 vectors expressing PPM1D were injected into the bilateral hippocampus. In vitro, the mouse hippocampal neuron cell line HT22 was stimulated by Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>42</sub> to trigger neuronal damage. High PPM1D expression alleviated the impairments of spatial cognition and memory in APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, PPM1D enhanced autophagosome formation, lysosomal degradation of impaired mitochondria, amyloid plaque deposition, and neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Similar effects of PPM1D on neuronal apoptosis and mitophagy were observed in Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>42</sub>-treated HT22 cells, and the effects could be reversed by the mitophagy inhibitor cyclosporine A. In conclusion, PPM1D facilitates mitophagy to inhibit the progression of AD-like disease. Taken together, the present work uncovers defective mitophagy in AD may be associated with down-regulated PPM1D, and PPM1D may be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",Exp Neurol
40013817,Visualization of Oxidative Stress in the Early Stage of Alzheimer's Disease with a NIR-IIb Probe.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with the complete loss of cognition, and its pathogenesis has been suggested to be closely linked to oxidative stress in the early stage. However, there is currently a lack of effective methods to provide direct evidence for dynamic development of the oxidative stress status during AD progression. Herein, through manipulating the multiple energy transfer between 4f electronic levels of lanthanide ions (Ln<sup>3+</sup>), we proposed an energy interception strategy to construct activatable NIR-IIb nanoprobe for visualizing oxidative stress level. By utilizing an organic molecule, A1094 that absorbs light at wavelength matching the emission of Nd<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup>, NIR-IIb emission from Er<sup>3+</sup> can be modulated upon the response of A1094 to oxidative species.

However, evidence on UFPs and dementia remains limited. This study assessed the association between UFP exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) among U.S. older adults. Using Medicare data, we analyzed ZIP code-level UFP exposure in 2017 for beneficiaries aged 65 and older residing in the contiguous U.S., applying Cox proportional hazard models to estimate AD and ADRD incidence (2018-2020) while considering comorbidities. Among ∼21 million participants for AD and ∼20 million for ADRD, each interquartile range increase in UFP exposure (3701.6 and 3668.5 particles/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively) was associated with higher AD (HR: 1.026, 95% CI: 1.014-1.038) and ADRD (HR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.008-1.023) risks. The association was linear within typical exposure levels and stronger in individuals with comorbidities. Geographically, the UFP-associated dementia risk was higher in rural areas than in urban areas, possibly due to different pollution sources. These findings underscore UFPs as neurotoxicants and highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to protect vulnerable populations.",Environ Sci Technol

This study aimed to investigate the associations between IHD, brain glymphatic MRI indices and risk of AD.
METHODS: A total of 1385 non-dementia subjects (55.2 % male, mean age 73.53) were included. Diffusivity along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), free water (FW) and choroid plexus volume were used to reflect glymphatic function. The associations of IHD with MRI derived glymphatic indices, PET amyloid, tau and cognitive performance were explored by multiple regression analysis. IHD were tested as predictors of clinical progression using cox proportional hazards modeling. The mediation effect of MRI derived glymphatic indices on the relationship between IHD and cognitive changes was investigated.
RESULTS: Individuals with IHD exhibited glymphatic dysfunction revealed by lower DTI-ALPS (p = 0.035), higher FW (p < 0.001), and higher choroid plexus volume (p = 0.019). IHD had poorer cognitive performance in MMSE (p = 0.022), ADNI-MEM (p = 0.001) and ADNI-MF (p = 0.006), and more amyloid deposition (p = 0.007). IHD had a higher diagnostic conversion risk (HR = 1.321, 95 % CI = 1.003-1.741). IHD was associated with longitudinal cognitive decline in all cognitive tests (p < 0.05 for all) and FW (β = 0.012, 95 % CI 0.001, 0.023, p = 0.038).

CONCLUSION: IHD is independently associated with AD risk, and brain glymphatic dysfunction may partially mediate this relationship.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
39985292,Identification of CXCR4 inhibitory activity in natural compounds using cheminformatics-guided machine learning algorithms.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by progressive damage to neurons that leads to cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. Current treatment options focus only on symptom management and palliative care, without addressing their root cause. In our previous study, we reported the upregulation of the CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), in Alzheimer's disease (ad) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We reached this conclusion by analysing gene expression patterns of ad and PD patients, compared to healthy individuals of similar age. We used RNA sequencing data from Gene Expression Omnibus to carry out this analysis. Herein, we aim to identify natural compounds that have potential inhibitory activity against CXCR4 through cheminformatics-guided machine learning, to aid drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders, especially ad and PD. Natural compounds are gaining prominence in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders due to their biocompatibility and potential neuroprotective properties, including their ability to modulate CXCR4 expression. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have opened new avenues for drug discovery research across various therapeutic areas, including neurodegenerative disorders. We aim to produce an ML model using cheminformatics-guided machine learning algorithms using data of compounds with known CXCR4 activity, retrieved from the Binding Database, to analyse various physicochemical attributes of natural compounds obtained from the COCONUT Database and predict their inhibitory activity against CXCR4. Insight Box This work extends our previous study published in Integrative Biology (DOI: 10.1093/intbio/zyad012). We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of AI and ML in identifying potential treatment options for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. By analysing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that may not be apparent to human researchers, AI-powered systems can provide valuable insight into potential treatment options that may have been overlooked through traditional research methods. Our study underscores the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and experimental scientists in drug discovery and in developing a robust pipeline to identify potential leads for drug development.",Integr Biol (Camb)
40095665,Association of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health and apolipoprotein E4 genotype with risk of dementia and mortality.,"BackgroundPoor cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health is becoming prevalent; however, sparse data exist regarding the association of CKM health with incident dementia and all-cause mortality.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether poor CKM health is associated with a higher risk of dementia and all-cause mortality, regardless of APOE4 carrier status.MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, 352,364 participants from the UK Biobank were included. CKM syndrome was identified as a medical condition with the presence of metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, and was classified into five stages (stage 0 to 4). Cox proportional hazards models were applied to explore the association of CKM health with incident dementia and all-cause mortality.ResultsParticipants in stage 2-3 and stage 4 had 1.12-fold (95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = 0.023) and 2.18-fold (95% CI: 1.96-2.43, p &lt; 0.001) increased risk of incident all-cause dementia compared with those in stage 0. Similarly, participants in stage 4 also had an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.28-1.78, p &lt; 0.001) and vascular dementia (HR = 4.62, 95% CI: 3.54-6.03, p &lt; 0.001). Participants in later stages were at higher risk of all-cause mortality. We found an interaction between CKM health and APOE4 carrier status (p for interaction &lt;0.001), and the relationship between CKM health and dementia was more pronounced in non-APOE4 carriers. Moreover, there were significant additive interactions between APOE4 carrier status and CKM health on the risk of dementia.ConclusionsPoor CKM health is independently associated with an increased risk of dementia, regardless of APOE4 carrier status, and all-cause mortality. These findings imply that promoting CKM health may help to reduce the risk of subsequent dementia and mortality.",J Alzheimers Dis
40037709,Deep learning-based cell-specific gene regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multiome data.,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a global representation of how genetic/genomic information is transferred in living systems and are a key component in understanding genome regulation. Single-cell multiome data provide unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct GRNs at fine-grained resolution. However, the inference of GRNs is hindered by insufficient single omic profiles due to the characteristic high loss rate of single-cell sequencing data. In this study, we developed scMultiomeGRN, a deep learning framework to infer transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks via unique integration of single-cell genomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and epigenomic (single-cell ATAC sequencing) data. We create scMultiomeGRN to elucidate these networks by conceptualizing TF network graph structures. Specifically, we build modality-specific neighbor aggregators and cross-modal attention modules to learn latent representations of TFs from single-cell multi-omics. We demonstrate that scMultiomeGRN outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark datasets involved in diseases and health. Via scMultiomeGRN, we identified Alzheimer's disease-relevant regulatory network of SPI1 and RUNX1 for microglia. In summary, scMultiomeGRN offers a deep learning framework to identify cell type-specific gene regulatory network from single-cell multiome data.",Nucleic Acids Res
40020501,Precision delivery of pretreated macrophage-membrane-coated Pt nanoclusters for improving Alzheimer's disease-like cognitive dysfunction induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis.,"Oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a kind of pathogenic bacteria causing periodontitis, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cause cognitive decline. Therefore, precise intracerebral antimicrobial therapy to reduce the load of P. gingivalis in brain may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to improve AD-like cognitive impairment. A kind of nano-delivery system precisely targets bacteria in the brain through coating P. gingivalis stimulated macrophage membrane onto the surface of platinum nanoclusters (Pg-M-PtNCs). Approximate 50 nm spherical Pg-M-PtNCs demonstrate good biocompatibility and the pretreated macrophage membranes can inhibit macrophages phagocytosis and increase the adherence to bacteria. Pg-M-PtNCs can significantly inhibit the growth of P.gingivalis in vitro, and are effectively delivered and remain at the infection site in the mice brain to reduce the bacterial load and neuronal damage, and then improve the AD-like cognitive dysfunction in the chronic periodontitis mice. Platinum nanoclusters coated with P. gingivalis pretreated macrophage membrane play an important role in targeting bacteria in the brain, and effectively improve AD-like cognitive function disorder caused by P. gingivalis infection in the brain.",Biomaterials
39983802,The causal relationship of inflammation-related factors with osteoporosis: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to examine whether genetically determined inflammation-related risk factors play a role in the onset of osteoporosis (OP) in the European population.
METHODS: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) summary statistics of estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) obtained from the public database GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis Consortium (GEFOS) including 142,487 European people. For exposures, we utilized GWAS data of 9 risk factors including diseases chronic kidney disease (CKD) (41,395 cases and 439,303 controls), type 2 diabetes (T2D) (88,427 cases and 566,778 controls), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls) and major depression disorder (MDD) (9240 cases and 9519 controls) and lifestyle behaviors are from different consortiums. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis was principal method in this study and random effect model was applied; MR-Egger method and weighted median method were also performed for reliable results. Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger regression were used to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy and leave-one-out analysis was performed to find out whether there are influential SNPs.
RESULTS: We found that T2D (IVW: β = 0.05, P = 0.0014), FI (IVW: β = -0.22, P < 0.001), CKD (IVW: β = 0.02, P = 0.009), ALZ (IVW: β = 0.06, P = 0.005), Coffee consumption (IVW: β = 0.11, P = 0.003) were causally associated with OP (P<0.006after Bonferroni correction).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that T2D, FI, CKD, ALZ and coffee consumption are causally associated with OP. Future interventions targeting factors above could provide new clinical strategies for the personalized prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.",Exp Gerontol
40125335,Study on cognitive impairment evaluation based on photoelectric neural information.,"BACKGROUND: Whether there is a cognitive load-dependent brain activation pattern in the pre-Alzheimer's disease phase is unknown. Multimodal system provides a powerful technical tool.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated brain activity patterns under different cognitive loads in patients with mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals and electroencephalography signals were acquired from the mild cognitive impairment group (MCI, n = 20) and the healthy control group (HC, n = 24) under four cognitive loads. We analyzed the respective brain activity features and performed correlation analyses.
RESULTS: (1) During the encoding phase, both the left occipital (p <sub>cond </sub>= 0.05, p <sub>group </sub>&lt; 0.01) and left temporal (p <sub>cond </sub>= 0.02, p <sub>group </sub>= 0.03) skewness condition effects and between-group effects were significant. (2) As the cognitive load increased, the clustering coefficients and local efficiencies were significantly lower for the HC group. (3) The left occipital and left temporal activation skewness in the MCI group were significantly correlated with left occipital electrical features, whereas the left occipital activation intensity and skewness were significantly correlated with left occipital electrical features in HC group.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of brain activity in MCI depends on cognitive load. Left occipital and left temporal may be important brain regions for evaluating MCI and need to be focused on in the future.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40069380,Examining the effects of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields on cognitive functions and functional brain markers in aged mice.,"Extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) are ubiquitously present in various environments of everyday life. While surveys from the World Health Organization (WHO) have not demonstrated the existence of ELF-MF-induced harmful consequences in healthy subjects, whether older adults are more vulnerable to the effects of residential and occupational ELF-MF exposure, and therefore may be at risk, remains unsettled. Here, we explored this potential health issue by investigating, in aged mice, the effects of chronic exposure to ELF-MFs (50 Hz ELF-MF at 1 mT for 8 h/day, 5 days/week for 12 consecutive weeks) on cognitive functions and expression profile of brain markers typically associated with aggravated aging or the development of Alzheimer`s disease (AD). Sham-exposed mice showed a significant age-related decline in spatial memory functions compared to young adult mice. However, this expected pattern was neither exacerbated nor counteracted by chronic exposure to ELF-MFs. No difference in hippocampal expression of APP-695, Aβ<sub>(1-42)</sub>, S100b and GFAP proteins or in the pTau/Tau ratio was observed between sham- and ELF-MF-exposed aged mice, suggesting that chronic exposure to ELF-MFs does not aggravate aging and associated neuroinflammation, or promote pathological pathways involved in the initiation of AD. Because care should be taken in extrapolating these results to older adults with various comorbidities, applying current exposure limits to existing or new sensitive ELF-MF locations is recommended.",Sci Rep
40040632,Phytochemical Analysis and Pharmaceutical Applications of Monoterpenoids Present in the Essential Oil of Boswellia sacra (Omani Luban).,"Due to its intricacy and long-term usefulness, traditional medicine continues to be practiced in several nations. Among the many medicinal plants found in the Dhofar region of Oman, the aromatic oleo-gum resin generated by Boswellia sacra, commonly referred to as frankincense, stands out for its medical and commercial significance. Resin-carrying ducts are unique to members of the Boswellia family. Boswellia sacra Flueck is one of the 29 species in the genus Boswellia (Burseraceae) and has long been cultivated for its aromatic gums and resins for use as incense. In addition to the resins (60%-80% alcohol soluble), gums (15%-20% water soluble), and essential oil (5%-7%), other components, including polysaccharides and polymeric compounds, also exist in smaller amounts. Physiochemical analyses indicate that Boswellia resin oil is made up of 42.5% diterpenes, 13.1% monoterpenes, and 1% sesquiterpenes. Traditional medicine makes extensive use of frankincense for the treatment of stomach diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic illnesses. The bioactive chemicals present in frankincense, particularly boswellic acids, are plentiful. The current review examines various compounds present in different species of Boswellia, especially Boswellia sacra, along with their structure.",Adv Pharmacol Pharm Sci
40111916,Associations of metabolic syndrome with risks of dementia and cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundPrevious studies have linked metabolic syndrome (MetS) to dementia risk.ObjectiveWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between MetS and dementia as well as cognitive impairment, with additional focus on individual MetS components.MethodsWe systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception through July 2024. We used random-effects models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was evaluated using the Egger's test, while potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated through meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses.ResultsOur analysis included 21 studies with a total of 411,810 participants. MetS was associated with increased risks of all-cause dementia (RR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03-1.71, I² = 85.8%) and vascular dementia (RR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.32-3.24, I² = 10.1%), but not Alzheimer's disease (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.64-1.91, I² = 81.8%). Regarding cognitive impairment, longitudinal studies showed an increased risk (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.24-1.53, I² = 3.3%), with similar findings in cross-sectional studies (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.19-2.28, I² = 85.3%).ConclusionsThis study found that MetS is significantly associated with increased risks of dementia and cognitive impairment, with each component potentially being a modifiable factor. These findings may help guide clinicians in recommending lifestyle interventions to prevent cognitive decline and promote brain health.",J Alzheimers Dis
40151764,The role of branched chain aminotransferase in the interrelated pathways of type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVES: This review assessed the role of Branched-Chain Amino Acid Transaminase (BCAT) enzymes in human metabolism, and their involvement in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and exploring the association between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through insulin resistance.
METHODS: The analysis involves a comprehensive literature review of recent research findings related to BCAT enzymes, BCAA metabolism, T2DM, and AD. Relevant studies and articles were identified through systematic searches in databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, and other scholarly resources. Inclusion criteria encompassed research articles, reviews, and studies published in peer-reviewed journals, with a focus on human metabolism, BCAT enzymes, and the interplay between BCAA metabolism, T2DM, and AD.
RESULTS: The association between T2DM and AD suggests a potential metabolic link, particularly through dysregulated BCAA metabolism leading to insulin resistance. The impact of impaired insulin signaling is implicated in brain function and the accumulation of amyloid plaques facilitated by BCAT.
CONCLUSION: The identified link between BCAT, BCAA metabolism, T2DM, and AD suggests that disruptions in BCAT levels could serve as valuable indicators for early detection of insulin resistance and cognitive impairment as observed in Type 3 Diabetes which may present a promising therapeutic target.",J Diabetes Metab Disord

Meanwhile, low daily fluid intake was cross-sectionally related with cerebrovascular injury.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that high daily fluid intake is associated with decreased brain amyloid deposition, indicating that sufficient daily fluid intake may be helpful for prevention of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40041377,Discovery of novel theophylline derivatives bearing tetrazole scaffold for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with AChE and BACE1 enzymes. Designing inhibitors for preventing these enzymes can be benefit for AD treatment. In this context, theophylline derivatives were generated to prevent the biological activity of AChE and BACE1. In particular, the potential inhibitory of these compounds was rapidly and accurately estimated via knowledge-methods. The in vitro tests were then performed to validate the artificial intelligent approach. Among these, compound 12 exhibited the most potent AChE inhibition with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15.68 μM, while showing limited activity against BACE1. In addition, six compounds were indicated that are able to inhibit AChE, however, the theophylline derivatives play poor performance over the BACE1 target. Atomistic simulations were finally applied to clarify the ligand-binding mechanism to the biological target. The outcomes disclose that theophylline derivatives rigidly form van der Waals interactions to AChE via π-stacking and SC contacts. Overall, the theophylline derivatives may offer a potential scaffold for novel anti-AD agents.",RSC Adv
40025713,"Healthcare providers perspectives and perceptions of dementia diagnosis and management at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.","BACKGROUND: The rising number of older people, including those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) highlights the need for an improved clinical diagnosis and management of the diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To understand and describe healthcare providers' perceptions and practices regarding AD/ADRD diagnosis and care in Kenya, not previously reported.
METHODS: This was an ethnographic study involving observations and semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers working at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN) Kenya. Twenty-one healthcare providers were purposively recruited and interviewed in English, with the data transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using Nvivo version 14.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal that AKUHN's dementia diagnostic pathway aligns with universal best practice models and involves multidisciplinary care. Yet, healthcare providers noted that this level of care is not representative of most public hospitals in Kenya, where a lack of diagnostic equipment and trained staff severely limits patient access to timely dementia care. In addition, new medications that can slow AD/ADRD progression, are not readily available in Africa, including Kenya. We also identified barriers to timely diagnosis and care such as: lack of dementia policy and guidelines, limited expertise of healthcare providers, high cost of care, and sociocultural factors, including stigma.
CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the need for the Kenyan government and relevant stakeholders to develop social and healthcare policies and allocate resources to raise awareness about dementia and combat stigma; train healthcare providers; improve early detection and service delivery through access to diagnostic tools, and establish clear guidelines/protocols for AD/ADRD care.",J Alzheimers Dis
40036856,Midlife dementia risk scores in a multi-ethnic population in the Netherlands: the HELIUS study.,"BACKGROUND: Migrant populations in the Netherlands may face greater dementia risk factor burden than Dutch natives.
OBJECTIVES: To study whether midlife dementia risk scores differ by ethnicity.
METHODS: We calculated three validated dementia risk scores in participants aged 40-70 years of Dutch (n = 2978), South-Asian Surinamese (n = 2084), African Surinamese (n = 3135), Ghanaian (n = 1699), Turkish (n = 2000), and Moroccan (n = 2025) background, from the HELIUS study (Amsterdam, the Netherlands): Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE), LIfestyle for BRAin Health (LIBRA), and Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI). We cross-sectionally compared scores between ethnicities using linear regression.
RESULTS: Ethnic minority groups had higher risk scores than those with a Dutch background (CAIDE: +0.66-1.35; LIBRA: +0.66-1.43; ANU-ADRI: +2.75-7.25). CAIDE estimated an absolute 20-year incident dementia risk of 2.6% for Dutch, 3.4% for South-Asian Surinamese, 3.6% for Turkish, 3.7% for Moroccan, 3.7% for African Surinamese and 4.5% for Ghanaian populations. Differences were greater when removing age from scores (CAIDE +0.89-2.22; ANU-ADRI +3.03-8.20), implying that this higher risk score is independent of age.
CONCLUSION: Migrant populations had higher dementia risk scores than Dutch natives. Validation of these scores in migrant populations is warranted. If replicated, ethnicity should be considered when estimating dementia risk and developing preventive strategies for high-risk populations.",J Public Health (Oxf)
40065919,Blood-based biomarker prescreening with different testing combinations and cutoffs: A simulation study examining efficacy and cost-effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease prevention studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), including plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) or phosphorylated tau (p-tau), combined with apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing, are anticipated to serve as prescreening tools before amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) for recruiting participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention studies. The predictive efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prescreening may vary with different testing combinations, sequences, and cutoff levels.
METHODS: We conducted a simulation study utilizing data from our ongoing Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort (J-TRC) onsite study (n = 202) recruited online. We included cognitively unimpaired individuals who had undergone amyloid PET, APOE genotyping, and evaluation of BBBMs (i.e., plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, plasma p-tau217, and plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio). We examined 14 different prescreening models incorporating APOE genotype and/or BBBMs with varied combinations and cutoff levels. Models were evaluated for predictive performance (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value [PPV]) and cost-effectiveness (cost per identified amyloid-positive case) across varied testing costs and the prevalence of amyloid positivity.
RESULTS: Applying BBBM prescreening significantly decreased sensitivity and increased specificity and PPV compared to the no-prescreening scenario. Although no single model was superior in all performance metrics, a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity was observed. Generalized linear models (GLMs) simultaneously incorporating plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and p-tau217 showed a balanced efficacy (the best level of improvement in number needed to screen (NNS) but modest worsening in sensitivity) and the best level of cost-effectiveness compared to other models, although there were substantial overlaps in their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The minimum-required PET/BBBM cost ratio to achieve improved cost-effectiveness by employing the prescreening process was negatively associated with the background prevalence of amyloid positivity.
DISCUSSION: The choice of prescreening strategy in AD prevention studies/trials should be tailored to specific trial requirements, considering the relative importance of sensitivity versus cost-effectiveness, local testing cost environments, and background population characteristics.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated different models of blood-based biomarker (BBBM) prescreening.Data from Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort Study were used for simulation.BBBM reduced the number needed to screen with positron emission tomography (PET) but decreased the sensitivity.The cost-effectiveness improved with a higher PET/BBBM cost ratio.No single model was optimal for all scenarios.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40092369,Unraveling the role of proteins in dementia: insights from two UK cohorts with causal evidence.,"Population-based proteomics offers a groundbreaking avenue to predict future disease risks, enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, and discover novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The role of plasma proteins in dementia, however, requires further exploration. This study investigated 276 protein-dementia associations in 229 incident all-cause dementia, 89 Alzheimer's disease, and 41 vascular dementia among 3249 participants (55% women, 97.2% white ethnicity) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) over a median 9.8-year follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazard regression for the analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to assess the precision of the identified proteins from the fully adjusted Cox regression models in predicting incident all-cause dementia, both individually and in combination with demographic predictors, APOE genotype, and memory score, to estimate the area under the curve. Additionally, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm was used to identify the most important features predictive of future all-cause dementia onset. These associations were then validated in 1506 incident all-cause dementia, 732 Alzheimer's disease, 281 vascular dementia, and 111 frontotemporal dementia cases among 52 745 individuals (53.9% women, 93.3% White ethnicity) from the UK Biobank over a median 13.7-year follow-up. Two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization and drug target Mendelian randomization were further employed to determine the causal direction between protein concentration and dementia. NEFL (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]: 1.54 [1.29, 1.84]) and RPS6KB1 (HR [95% CI]: 1.33 [1.16, 1.52]) were robustly associated with incident all-cause dementia; MMP12 (HR [95% CI]: 2.06 [1.41, 2.99]) was associated with vascular dementia in ELSA, after correcting for multiple testing. Additional markers EDA2R and KIM1 were identified from subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Combining NEFL and RPS6KB1 with other predictors yielded high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.871) for incident all-cause dementia. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm also identified RPS6KB1, NEFL, and KIM1 as the most important protein features for predicting future all-cause dementia. Sex difference was evident for the association between RPS6KB1 and all-cause dementia, with stronger association in men (P for interaction = 0.037). Replication in the UK Biobank confirmed the associations between the identified proteins and various dementia subtypes. The results from Mendelian randomization in the reverse direction indicated that several proteins serve as early markers for dementia, rather than being direct causes of the disease. These findings provide insights into putative mechanisms for dementia. Future studies are needed to validate the findings on RPS6KB1 in relation to dementia risk.",Brain Commun
40019895,Innovations in noninvasive sensory stimulation treatments to combat Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this debilitating condition.",PLoS Biol
40028141,Ultrasensitive Assays Detect Different Conformations of Plasma β Amyloids.,"With the developments of ultrasensitive technologies such as immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay, single molecule array (SIMOA) assay, electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), the assay of blood-based amyloid 1-42 (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) becomes possible. However, the changes in measured plasma Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> concentrations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively unimpaired subjects (CU) are inconsistent. A possible reason for the inconsistency regarding various conformations of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in plasma is explored in this study. Three samples with equal amounts of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> but different proportions of monomers and oligomers of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> were prepared. The Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> composition of monomers and oligomers in samples was analyzed with Western blot. Identically diluted versions of these three samples were assayed with IMR and SIMOA for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> concentrations. The three diluted samples showed similar levels of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> assayed with IMR, whereas much lower levels for samples with more oligomers assayed with SIOMA. The results imply that IMR detects both monomers and oligomers of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. The measured levels of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> are independent of the proportions of monomer or oligomer Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> but depend on the total amounts of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. In the case of SIMOA, monomers of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> are the primary target measured. By comparing Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> concentrations of the plasma using IMR and SIMOA, the significant difference in plasma Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels using IMR in AD compared to CU is mainly due to the formations of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Therefore, if the target molecules are monomers of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, SIMOA is the method of choice. Still, if the target molecules should include monomers, small and large oligomers, IMR would be an optimal consideration. In the future, the clinical implications of the proportion of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> need to be elucidated.",ACS Omega
40086910,Correlation between changes in apathy and cognition in Alzheimer's disease associated apathy: Analysis of the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2).,"BACKGROUND: Previous trials have shown improvements in both apathy and cognition with methylphenidate (MPH).
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether changes in apathy correlated with changes in cognition in the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2).
PARTICIPANTS: Mild to moderate AD patients with clinically significant apathy randomized to MPH (20 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months.
MEASUREMENTS: Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy (NPI-A) domain. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Hopkins Verbal Learning (immediate [HVLT-I], delayed [HVLT-D] recall), Digit Span (Forward [DF], Backward [DB]), Trail Making (TMT-A, TMT-B), Action Verbal Fluency (AV), Category Fluency (CF), and the Short Boston Naming Test (BNT).
DESIGN: Linear mixed models included cognitive change scores as dependent variables and time, treatment, change in NPI-A and the interaction between treatment and change in NPI-A as independent variables, which were additionally adjusted for baseline NPI-A and cognitive scores, age, sex, level of education and presence of diabetes.
RESULTS: 199 participants (66 % male) were included (98-MPH, 101-placebo). Among all participants, worsening CF was associated with worsening apathy (-0.15 (0.05), p = .003). In addition, change in HVLT-I was associated with the interaction between changes in apathy and treatment (-0.31 (0.07), p = 0.0000158).
CONCLUSION: Changes in apathy are mostly independent of cognitive changes and apathy response to MPH may be independent from cognition. These results are consistent with the view that apathy as a syndrome is related to but distinct from cognition.",Int Psychogeriatr
40007760,Mechanistic insights into connexin-mediated neuroglia crosstalk in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Huntington's disease (HD), although distinct in their clinical manifestations, share a common hallmark: a disrupted neuroinflammatory environment orchestrated by dysregulation of neuroglial intercellular communication. Neuroglial crosstalk is physiologically ensured by extracellular mediators and by the activity of connexins (Cxs), the forming proteins of gap junctions (Gjs) and hemichannels (HCs), which maintain intracellular and extracellular homeostasis. However, accumulating evidence suggests that Cxs can also act as pathological pore in neuroinflammatory conditions, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative phenomena such as synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ultimately cell death. This review explores mechanistic insights of Cxs-mediated intercellular communication in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting Cxs to restore cellular homeostasis.",Front Cell Neurosci
40149871,THOP1 Is Entailed in a Genetic Fingerprint Associated with Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"In a systematic explorative study of genetic patterns on chromosome 19, we discovered a pattern comprising 23 SNP alleles that is significantly associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). This association was validated using two independent datasets. The pattern includes thimet oligopeptidase (THOP1), which has a long and disputatious relationship with AD. It also spans solute carrier family 39 member 3 (SLC39A3) and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat co-chaperone alpha (SGTA) and is upstream from DIRAS family GTPase 1 (DIRAS1). We utilized population data to observe the frequencies of this genetic pattern for 11 different ancestries and noted that it is highly common for Europeans and relatively infrequent for Africans. This research provides a distinct genetic signature for AD risk, as well as insights into the complicated relationship between this disease and THOP1.",Biomolecules
39986234,Response of Alzheimer's disease-like triple transgenic 3x-Tg mice to experimental migraine evoked by nitroglycerin.,"Migraine is a disabling chronic condition of the central nervous system (CNS) with accelerated prevalence in females. Emerging studies demonstrated that females with a history of migraine have a 37 % higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to same-age males with a history of migraine. To date, it remains unclear how to address sex-associated migraine disorder in patients with AD due to our limited knowledge of the molecular crosstalk behind these two CNS disorders. There are no available animal models that recapitulate both migraine pain and AD phenotypes. Since nitroglycerin (NTG) is widely used in clinics and in experimental wild-type rodent models to monitor migraine symptoms, we aimed to evaluate whether NTG accelerates migraine pain and affects AD hallmarks. Our group and previous reports have shown that the AD-like triple transgenic (3x-Tg) mice demonstrate behavioral changes and pathogenic amyloidogenesis in response to chronic inflammation. Therefore, we treated 3x-Tg mice every other day with ten intraperitoneal injections of NTG or saline. In response to NTG, female 3xTg mice demonstrated accelerated pain responses and diminished cognitive performance during a spatial learning and memory task compared to males and saline exposed groups. We also observed accelerated AD-associated amyloidogenesis in NTG-exposed females compared to the saline group. No sex differences between NTG-treated groups were detected relative to pain threshold, behavioral, and amyloidogenesis changes. Collectively, this novel migraine model induced in AD 3x-Tg mice allowed us to monitor the effect of NTG on the pain threshold, behavioral changes, and pathogenic amyloidogenesis in males and females.",Biomed Pharmacother
40018917,The Potential Mechanism and the Role of Antioxidants in Mitigating Oxidative Stress in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and a significant contributor to health issues and mortality among older individuals. This condition involves a progressive deterioration in cognitive function and the onset of dementia. Recent advancements suggest that the development of AD is more intricate than its underlying brain abnormalities alone. In addition, Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome, and oxidative stress are all intricately linked to one another. Increased concentrations of circulating lipids and disturbances in glucose homeostasis contribute to the intensification of lipid oxidation, leading to a gradual depletion of the body's antioxidant defenses. This heightened oxidative metabolism adversely impacts cell integrity, resulting in neuronal damage. Pathways commonly acknowledged as contributors to AD pathogenesis include alterations in synaptic plasticity, disorganization of neurons, and cell death. Abnormal metabolism of some membrane proteins is thought to cause the creation of amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, which are extremely hazardous to neurotransmission pathways, especially those involving acetylcholine. The interaction between Aβ oligomers and these neurotransmitter systems is thought to induce cellular dysfunction, an imbalance in neurotransmitter signaling, and, ultimately, the manifestation of neurological symptoms. Antioxidants have a significant impact on human health since they may improve the aging process by combating free radicals. Neurodegenerative diseases are currently incurable; however, they may be effectively managed. An appealing alternative is the utilization of natural antioxidants, such as polyphenols, through diet or dietary supplements, which offer numerous advantages. Within this framework, we have extensively examined the importance of oxidative stress in the advancement of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the potential influence of antioxidants in mitigating its effects.",Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)
40072076,Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Stem Cell's Perspective.,"Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a number of very heterogeneous disorders, primarily characterized by neuronal loss and a concomitant decline in neurological function. Examples of this type of clinical condition are Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Age has been identified as a major risk in the etiology of these disorders, which explains their increased incidence in developed countries. Unfortunately, despite continued and intensive efforts, no cure has yet been found for any of these diseases; reliable markers that allow for an early diagnosis of the disease and the identification of key molecular events leading to disease onset and progression are lacking. Altered adult neurogenesis appears to precede the appearance of severe symptoms. Given the scarcity of human samples and the considerable differences with model species, increasingly complex human stem-cell-based models are being developed. These are shedding light on the molecular alterations that contribute to disease development, facilitating the identification of new clinical targets and providing a screening platform for the testing of candidate drugs. Moreover, the secretome and other promising features of these cell types are being explored, to use them as replacement cells of high plasticity or as co-adjuvant therapy in combinatorial treatments.",Cells
40114191,Asrij/OCIAD1 depletion reduces inflammatory microglial activation and ameliorates Aβ pathology in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. Asrij/OCIAD1 (Ovarian Carcinoma Immunoreactive Antigen Domain containing protein 1) is an AD-associated factor. Increased Asrij levels in the brains of AD patients and mouse models are linked to the severity of neurodegeneration. However, the contribution of Asrij to AD progression and whether reducing Asrij levels is sufficient to mitigate Aβ pathology in vivo is unclear.
METHODS: To explore the impact of Asrij on AD pathology, we deleted asrij in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and analyzed the effects on AD hallmarks. We used the Morris water maze and open field test to assess behavioral performance. Using immunohistochemistry and biochemical analyses, we evaluated Aβ plaque load, neuronal and synaptic damage, and gliosis. Further, we utilized confocal microscopy imaging, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing analysis to comprehensively investigate changes in microglial responses to Aβ pathology upon Asrij depletion.
RESULTS: Asrij depletion ameliorates cognitive impairments, Aβ deposition, neuronal and synaptic damage, and reactive astrogliosis in the AD mouse. Notably, Asrij-deficient microglia exhibit reduced plaque-associated proliferation and decreased phagocytic activation. Transcriptomic analyses of AD microglia reveal upregulation of energy metabolism pathways and downregulation of innate immunity and inflammatory pathways upon Asrij depletion. Mechanistically, loss of Asrij increases mitochondrial activity and impedes the acquisition of a pro-inflammatory disease-associated microglia (DAM) state. Reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and decreased STAT3 and NF-κB activation indicate protective changes in AD microglia. Taken together, our results suggest that increased Asrij levels reported in AD, may suppress microglial metabolic activity and promote inflammatory microglial activation, thereby exacerbating AD pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we show that Asrij depletion ameliorates Aβ pathology, neuronal and synaptic damage, gliosis, and improves behavioral performance in APP/PS1 mice. This supports that Asrij exacerbates the AD pathology. Mechanistically, Asrij is critical for the development of DAM and promotes neuroinflammatory signaling activation in microglia, thus restricting neuroprotective microglial responses. Hence, reducing Asrij in this context may help retard AD. Our work positions Asrij as a critical molecular regulator that links microglial dysfunction to AD pathogenesis.",J Neuroinflammation
40108895,"Inflecting Factors on Alzheimer's Disease Progression: The Interaction of Gut Microbiome, Oxidative Stress, and Nutritional Interventions.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurological condition caused by various factors. Diet, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota all play critical roles in the development of AD. Recent studies suggested a bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain, emphasizing the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in influencing cognitive functions. For instance, dysbiosis, a disruption in the balance of gut microbial communities, has been linked to neuroinflammation and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, hallmark features of AD. Oxidative stress, arising from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, contributes significantly to AD pathology. The molecular mechanisms through which oxidative stress impacts neuronal health and exacerbates the cognitive decline in AD patients are also relevant. Moreover, nutritional interventions emerge as promising strategies to modulate these inflecting factors. Dietary components, such as antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols, exhibit neuroprotective effects, potentially mitigating AD progression. In contrast, the Western diet has a high potential to abet AD onset. Mediterranean diet and/or intermittent fasting are more valuable diets that may help delay the AD onset or progression. Limitations like individual differences affect the efficacy of nutritional interventions. As a supporting therapy, personalized diets should be applied according to the patients' special needs/microbiomes in the future. To gather current knowledge on the interconnected roles of the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and nutritional interventions in AD is crucial. Understanding these interactions may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches, as well as disputing the potential diets that can help improve AD patients' quality of life.",Curr Top Med Chem
39991006,Cognitive efficacy of omega‑3 fatty acids in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta‑analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in several domains of higher cortical function. Both preclinical and clinical research has suggested that the supplementation omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) may have potential benefits for individuals with AD. The present study aimed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the association between omega-3 FA supplementation and cognitive function in patients with AD, using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) Subscale test as the primary outcome measure. A comprehensive search of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for all published RCTs up to December, 2023 that assessed cognition following omega-3 FA supplementation compared to placebo. A total of five studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis, with four of these studies being incorporated into the meta-analysis. From these studies, data were collected from a total of 702 patients with AD, with 376 participants receiving omega-3 FA supplementation and 326 participants receiving a placebo. The primary outcome measure was the ADAS-Cog score. The meta-analysis revealed that omega-3 FA supplementation had a non-significant impact on the ADAS-Cog score compared to placebo, with a mean difference of 1.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-2.73]. The heterogeneity among the included studies was moderate (I<sup>2</sup>=35%, P=0.17). The test for overall effect (z=1.96, P=0.05) indicated no statistical significance. Therefore, it was concluded that omega-3 FA supplementation does not significantly affect the cognitive function of adults with AD.",Biomed Rep
39985481,Human herpesvirus-associated transposable element activation in human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
METHODS: We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) dysregulation underlying AD etiologies.
RESULTS: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical validation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in real-world patient data.",Alzheimers Dement
39992588,Identification and Validation of Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Based on Akt and Wnt Signaling Pathways in Mouse Models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that remains challenging to treat. Akt and Wnt play a role in complex cellular signaling, which is crucial for examining the onset of AD. In this study, we aimed to identify and analyze Akt pathway-related genes (ARGs) and Wnt pathway-related genes (WRGs) as AD biomarkers, determine the effects of ARGs and WRGs on AD, and verify these effects in AD mouse models. We searched for differentially expressed genes in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, constructed candidate gene protein-protein interaction networks, and used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm to screen key genes. Correlation and functional similarity analyses of key genes, immune infiltration analysis, competing endogenous RNA network construction, and drug prediction of key genes were performed. Expression of key genes in streptozotocin-treated (STZ)-treated AD mice was validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatics analysis identified five key genes in AD: PRKACA, CDH3, ATP6V0C, DLL1, and CELSR2. Step-down tests, immunohistochemistry, and silver plate staining confirmed successful treatment of STZ-induced AD in mice. According to RT-qPCR analysis, the relative expression of DLL1 mRNA in AD mice was higher than that in control mice, whereas the relative expression of ATP6V0C and PRKACA mRNA in AD mice was lower than that in control mice; this was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis (p < 0.05). This study screened and validated AD biomarkers associated with the Akt and Wnt pathways in mouse models.",Mol Neurobiol
40081198,MCNEL: A multi-scale convolutional network and ensemble learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly threatens community well-being and healthcare resource allocation due to its high incidence and mortality. Therefore, early detection and intervention are crucial for reducing AD-related fatalities. However, the existing deep learning-based approaches often struggle to capture complex structural features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data effectively. Common techniques for multi-scale feature fusion, such as direct summation and concatenation methods, often introduce redundant noise that can negatively affect model performance. These challenges highlight the need for developing more advanced methods to improve feature extraction and fusion, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: This study proposes a multi-scale convolutional network and ensemble learning (MCNEL) framework for early and accurate AD diagnosis. The framework adopts enhanced versions of the EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV2 models, which are subsequently integrated with the DenseNet121 model to create a hybrid feature extraction tool capable of extracting features from multi-view slices. Additionally, a SimAM-based feature fusion method is developed to synthesize key feature information derived from multi-scale images. To ensure classification accuracy in distinguishing AD from multiple stages of cognitive impairment, this study designs an ensemble learning classifier model using multiple classifiers and a self-adaptive weight adjustment strategy.
RESULTS: Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset validate the effectiveness of our solution, which achieves average accuracies of 96.67% for ADNI-1 and 96.20% for ADNI-2, respectively. The results indicate that the MCNEL outperforms recent comparable algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in AD diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study markedly enhances the diagnostic capabilities for AD, allowing patients to receive timely treatments that can slow down disease progression and improve their quality of life.",Comput Methods Programs Biomed
40029638,Sex Differences in Longitudinal Tau-PET in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) predominates in females at almost twice the rate relative to males. Mounting evidence in adults without AD indicates that females exhibit higher tau deposition than age-matched males, particularly in the setting of elevated β-amyloid (Aβ), but the evidence for sex differences in tau accumulation rates is inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether female sex is associated with faster tau accumulation in the setting of high Aβ (as measured with positron emission tomography [PET]) and the moderating influence of sex on the association between APOEε4 carrier status and tau accumulation.
DATA SOURCES: This meta-analysis used data from 6 longitudinal aging and AD studies, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Berkeley Aging Cohort Study, BioFINDER 1, Harvard Aging Brain Study, Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention. Longitudinal data were collected between November 2004 and May 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Included studies required available longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir or [18F]-MK-6240 tau-PET scans, as well as baseline [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B, [18F]flutemetamol or [18F]florbetapir Aβ-PET scans. Recruitment criteria varied across studies. Analyses began on August 7, 2023, and were completed on February 5, 2024.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In each study, primary analyses extracted estimates for the sex (female or male) and the sex by baseline Aβ-PET status (high or low) association with longitudinal tau-PET using a series of mixed-effects models. Secondary mixed-effects models extracted the interaction estimate for the association of sex by APOEε4 carrier status with longitudinal tau-PET. Study-specific estimates for each mixed-effects model were then pooled in a meta-analysis, and the global fixed effect (β) and total heterogeneity (I2) across studies were estimated. This study is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven tau-PET outcomes that showed cross-sectional sex differences were examined across temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.
RESULTS: Among 6 studies assessed, there were 1376 participants (761 [55%] female; mean [range] age at first tau scan, 71.9 [46-93] years; 401 participants [29%] with high baseline Aβ; 412 APOEε4 carriers [30%]). Among individuals with high baseline Aβ, female sex was associated with faster tau accumulation localized to inferior temporal (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06; P = .009) temporal fusiform (β = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04; P = .02), and lateral occipital regions (β = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.06; P = .009) compared with male sex. Among APOEε4 carriers, female sex was associated with faster inferior-temporal tau accumulation (β = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that sex differences in the pathological progression of AD call for sex-specific timing considerations when administrating anti-Aβ and anti-tau treatments.",JAMA Neurol
39997020,Dual Monitoring of Blood Acetylcholinesterase Content and Catalytic Activity Utilizing Fluorometry-Integrated Surface Plasmon Resonance.,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), particularly donepezil, are commonly used to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, drug accumulation during long-term use could change AChE activity and content, leading to peripheral side effects and prompting medication discontinuation. However, there are a lack of methods to simultaneously determine the content and catalytic activity of AChE. By using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to strip AChE from erythrocyte surfaces, we developed a novel method combining surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence detection for the simultaneous detection of AChE content and activity, producing stable, reliable, and accurate results. The established determination range spans from 263.37 ng/mL to 3000 ng/mL (4.05 nM to 46.15 nM) for concentration, and from 39.02 mU/mL to 1000 mU/mL for activity. Compared to traditional methods, this approach simplifies operations, reduces detection time, expands the dynamic range, and lowers detection limits, potentially advancing AChE-related research and supporting clinical diagnostics and drug development.",Biosensors (Basel)
40076215,Towards Imaging Tau Hyperphosphorylation: Is DYRK1A a Potential Target for Imaging Hyperphosphorylation of Tau? Molecular Modeling Assessment and Synthesis of [<sup>125</sup>I]Radioiodinated DYRK1A Inhibitor.,"Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), a phosphorylation kinase, is localized within the central nervous system and is linked to hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Imaging of DYRK1A may provide an earlier biomarker for Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have used Chimera-Autodock to evaluate potential molecules for binding to the binding site of DYRK1A. Five molecules, 10-bromo-2-iodo-11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinoline-6-carboxylic acid (4E3), 10-iodo-11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinoline-6-carboxylic acid (KuFal184), harmine, 6-(fluoro-3-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)isoquinolin-5-amine (MK-6240), and 6-iodo-3-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-1-yl)isoquinoline (IPPI), were found to have binding energies of -10.4, -10.1, -9.0, -9.1, and -9.4 kcal/mole, respectively. Two molecules, 4E3 and KuFal184, were selective for DYRK1A, while harmine also had a monoamine oxidase A affinity, and MK-6240 and IPPI had affinity for Tau. Tau present in the brain slices of AD subject were labeled with [<sup>125</sup>I]IPPI. KuFal184 had no effect on the binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]IPPI, suggesting the absence of binding overlap of the two molecules. MK-6240, a known Tau agent was, however, able to compete with [<sup>125</sup>I]IPPI. The binding energies of harmine, MK-6240, and IPPI for the DYRK1A site suggest affinities of approximately 80-100 nM, which is insufficient to serve as an imaging agent. The higher affinity of KuFal184 (6 nM for DYRK1A) suggested that [<sup>125</sup>I]KuFal184 may be a potential imaging agent. Electrophilic radioiodination was used to synthesize [<sup>125</sup>I]KuFal184 in modest yields (25%) and high radiochemical purity (&gt;95%). Preliminary binding studies with [<sup>125</sup>I]KuFal184 in AD brain slices showed some selectivity for cortical grey matter regions containing Tau.",Molecules

OBJECTIVE: This study explores the potential of a speech-based machine learning (ML) approach in estimating cognitive impairment, using inputs of speech audio recordings.
METHODS: We develop an automatic ML pipeline that ingests multimodal inputs of audio and transcribed text, mapping speech and language to domain-specific biomarkers optimized for high explainability and predictive ability. The resulting features are fed through a multi-stage pipeline to determine efficient classification configurations.

40037473,Targeting RPSA to modulate endosomal trafficking and amyloidogenesis in genetic Alzheimer's disease.,"The ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, highlights the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) as a crucial trigger for the pathology. However, AD is an extremely complex disease influenced by multiple pathophysiological processes, making it impossible to attribute its onset to a single hypothesis. The endocytic pathway, where the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs, has emerged as a pathogenic ""hub"" for AD. In this study, we found altered homeostasis and dynamics of endolysosomal compartments in fibroblasts from patients affected by a genetic form of AD (APP V717I mutation). These alterations corresponded to an abnormal trafficking of APP along the endolysosomal pathway, favouring its amyloidogenic processing. The identification of APP interactors involved in its trafficking and processing, and finding molecules able to interfere with these interactions, represents a promising therapeutic approach. However, the role of endosomal pathway and the possibility of modulating APP processing through it remains elusive. Among the proteins participating to APP metabolism, the RPSA receptor and its inhibitor molecule NSC47924 have been identified. In this study, we found that the inhibitor, likely by displacing APP from interaction with its receptor, reduced APP accumulation in EEs in AD cells, finally restoring both endosomal dynamics and APP distribution to those of unaffected cells. We also demonstrated that RPSA inhibition affected the aberrant APP cleavage, as it reduced the production of both APP-βCTF (C-Terminal Fragment) and Aβ in AD fibroblasts. These results highlight significant differences in endolysosomal compartments and APP processing in AD-affected cells, refining our understanding of APP/RPSA intersection.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis
40106095,Connectivity related to major brain functions in Alzheimer disease progression: microstructural properties of the cingulum bundle and its subdivision using diffusion-weighted MRI.,"BACKGROUND: The cingulum bundle is a brain white matter fasciculus associated with the cingulate gyrus. It connects areas from the temporal to the frontal lobe. It is composed of fibers with different terminations, lengths, and structural properties, related to specific brain functions. We aimed to automatically reconstruct this fasciculus in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to assess whether trajectories have different microstructural properties in relation to dementia progression.
METHODS: Multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging-HARDI image datasets from the ""Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative""-ADNI repository of 10 AD, 18 MCI, and 21 cognitive normal (CN) subjects were used to reconstruct three subdivisions of the cingulum bundle, using a probabilistic approach, combined with measurements of diffusion tensor and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging metrics in each subdivision.
RESULTS: The subdivisions exhibit different pathways, terminations, and structural characteristics. We found differences in almost all the diffusivity metrics among the subdivisions (p < 0.001 for all the metrics) and between AD versus CN and MCI versus CN subjects for mean diffusivity (p = 0.007-0.038), radial diffusivity (p = 0.008-0.049) and neurite dispersion index (p = 0.005-0.049).
CONCLUSION: Results from tractography analysis of the subdivisions of the cingulum bundle showed an association in the role of groups of fibers with their functions and the variance of their properties in relation to dementia progression.
RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The cingulum bundle is a complex tract with several pathways and terminations related to many cognitive functions. A probabilistic automatic approach is proposed to reconstruct its subdivisions, showing different microstructural properties and variations. A larger sample of patients is needed to confirm results and elucidate the role of diffusion parameters in characterizing alterations in brain function and progression to dementia.
KEY POINTS: The microstructure of the cingulum bundle is related to brain cognitive functions. A probabilistic automatic approach is proposed to reconstruct the subdivisions of the cingulum bundle by diffusion-weighted images. The subdivisions showed different microstructural properties and variations in relation to the progression of dementia.",Eur Radiol Exp
40158459,Topological influence of immediate-early genes in brain genetic networks and their link to Alzheimer's disease.,"Immediate-early genes (IEGs), a subset of activity-regulated genes (ARGs), are rapidly and transiently activated by neuronal activity independent of protein synthesis. While extensively researched, the role of IEGs within genetic networks and their potential as drug targets for brain diseases remain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the topological influence of IEGs within genetic networks and explore their relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD). To achieve this, we employed a multi-step approach: mouse ARG data were analysed and mapped to human genes to identify the topological properties that distinguish IEGs from other ARGs; the involvement of ARGs in biological pathways and diseases and their mutational constraints were examined; ARG-related variants in AD were assessed using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and functional analysis; and network and GWAS findings were integrated to identify ARG-AD-associated genes. Our key findings were: (1) IEGs exhibit significantly higher topological influence across human and mouse gene networks compared to other ARGs; (2) ARGs are less frequently involved in diseases and exhibit higher mutational constraint than non-ARGs; (3) Several AD-associated variants are located in ARG regions, particularly in MARK4 near FOSB, with an AD risk eQTL that increases MARK4 expression in cortical areas; (4) MARK4 emerges as a key node in a dense AD multi-omic network and exhibits a high druggability score. These findings underscore the influential role of IEGs within genetic networks, providing valuable insights into their potential as intervention points for diseases characterised by downstream dysregulation, with MARK4 emerging as a promising and underexplored target for AD.",Comput Biol Med
40158246,Cerium-doped carbon dots as dual-target agents against Alzheimer's β-amyloid fibrillogenesis and reactive oxygen species.,"Both fibrillogenesis of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beyond Aβ aggregation inhibition, the complexity necessitates the development of comprehensive therapeutic interventions for halting AD progression. Herein, a dual-target agent capable of Aβ aggregation inhibition and ROS scavenging was synthesized by doping cerium into carbon dots (Ce CDs). Ce CDs with a high Ce (III)/Ce (IV) ratio of 0.67 can scavenge various ROS, including superoxide anion radicals, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and Aβ<sub>40</sub>-induced ROS, thus mitigating cellular oxidative damage and rescuing cell viability. Additionally, Ce CDs present potent inhibition on Aβ<sub>40</sub> on-pathway fibrillization, disrupting the formation of highly ordered β-sheet structures and increasing cell viability from 50.2 % to 91.9 %. It is validated that the electrostatic interactions between Ce CDs and Aβ<sub>40</sub> are primarily responsible for preventing the conformational transition of Aβ<sub>40</sub> monomers. In vivo experiments with the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain further validate the bifunctionality of Ce CDs in suppression of Aβ fibrillogenesis and attenuation of oxidative stress, thereby demonstrating the potential of combination therapy for AD. This finding highlights the important role of electrostatic interactions between Aβ and inhibitors in regulating Aβ aggregation, and provides new insights into the development of multifunctional agents for AD treatment.",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces
40010626,"Comprehensive evaluation of AChE inhibition by Eulophia ochreata extract utilizing in silico, ex vivo, and in vivo zebrafish models.","Dementia commonly accompanies various neurodegenerative conditions, notably Alzheimer's disease. The pursuit of natural therapies for these diseases and their related symptoms has garnered widespread global interest. The present study aimed to explore the potential of Eulophia ochreata L. extract, containing phenanthrene active compounds, as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Analytical techniques confirmed the presence of phenanthrene compounds in the extract, which were then screened for AChE inhibition through molecular docking, ex vivo assays, and scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in zebrafish larvae. These phenanthrene compounds, found in the extract of Eulophia ochreata L., exhibited a similar affinity for AChE as the standard drug Donepezil, with comparable interactions. Ex vivo assays using zebrafish larvae lysate and mouse brain homogenate indicated dose-dependent AChE inhibition with increasing extract concentrations. Behavioral assessments, including T and Y maze tests, revealed significant cognition improvement in extract-treated larvae having scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction, particularly at 1.3 µg/mL concentration. The combined results from molecular docking, ex vivo assays, and in vivo cognition deficit models underscored the potential of Eulophia ochreata L. extract as an AChE inhibitor, suggesting its phytochemicals could hold therapeutic promise, indicating further validation in mammalian models for translation into clinical therapies.",Brain Res
40124704,BrainNeXt: novel lightweight CNN model for the automated detection of brain disorders using MRI images.,"The main aim of this study is to propose a novel convolutional neural network, named BrainNeXt, for the automated brain disorders detection using magnetic resonance images (MRI) images. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the performance of our proposed network on various medical applications. To achieve high/robust image classification performance, we gathered a new MRI dataset belonging to four classes: (1) Alzheimer's disease, (2) chronic ischemia, (3) multiple sclerosis, and (4) control. Inspired by ConvNeXt, we designed BrainNeXt as a lightweight classification model by incorporating the structural elements of the Swin Transformers Tiny model. By training our model on the collected dataset, a pretrained BrainNeXt model was obtained. Additionally, we have suggested a feature engineering (FE) approach based on the pretrained BrainNeXt, which extracted features from fixed-sized patches. To select the most discriminative/informative features, we employed the neighborhood component analysis selector in the feature selection phase. As the classifier for our patch-based FE approach, we utilized the support vector machine classifier. Our recommended BrainNeXt approach achieved an accuracy of 100% and 91.35% for training and validation. The recommended model obtained the test classification accuracy of 94.21%. To further improve the classification performance, we suggested a patch-based DFE approach, which achieved a test accuracy of 99.73%. The obtained results, surpassing 90% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness and high classification performance of the proposed models.",Cogn Neurodyn
40051115,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction and Low-Grade Inflammation Associate With Enteric Neuronal Amyloid-β in a Model for Amyloid Pathology.,"BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving cognitive decline and memory impairment, often present with gastrointestinal comorbidities. Accumulating data also indicate that alterations in the gut can modulate Alzheimer's disease pathology, highlighting the need to better understand the link between gastrointestinal abnormalities and neurodegeneration in the brain.
METHODS: To disentangle the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, we conducted a detailed pathological characterization of the gastrointestinal tract of 5xFAD mice by performing histological analyses, gene expression studies, immunofluorescence labeling and gut function assays.
RESULTS: We found that 5xFAD mice have elevated levels of intestinal amyloid precursor protein and accumulate amyloid-β in enteric neurons. Histopathology revealed that this is associated with mild intestinal inflammation and fibrosis and accompanied by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. While overall enteric nervous system composition and organization appeared unaffected, 5xFAD mice have faster gastrointestinal transit.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that amyloid-β accumulation in enteric neurons is associated with low-grade intestinal inflammation and altered motility and suggest that peripheral pathology may cause gastrointestinal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease patients.",Neurogastroenterol Motil
40134937,Elevated TDP-43 serum levels associated with postoperative delirium following major cardiac surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a recurring complication among vulnerable patients undergoing major cardiac surgery. While delirium has been associated with prodromal dementia, there is minimal evidence to support the causality of this nuanced relationship. Clarification as to how postoperative delirium might lead to neurodegenerative dementias, perhaps through evidence of contemporaneous biomarkers, would heighten the plausibility of a causal correlation. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a nuclear protein essential for transcriptional events, has been linked to pathological aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).
METHODS: Circulating TDP-43 levels in cardiac surgical patients aged 60 years and older were evaluated in a biobank derived from the Minimizing ICU Neurological Dysfunction with Dexmedetomidine-induced Sleep (MINDDS) clinical trial. Serum total TDP-43 levels, measured with a single molecule array (Simoa), were compared across preoperative and postoperative day one timepoints according to delirium status assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). To investigate the temporal changes in serum TDP-43, an independent validation cohort of 25 patients aged 60 years and older undergoing major cardiac surgery was analyzed.
RESULTS: Total serum TDP-43 levels increased by 16.5% (95% CI: 5.9%-27.9%, p = 0.0021) on postoperative day one compared to baseline levels. This increase was more pronounced in patients who experienced delirium (median increase of 55.1%, 95% CI: 22.9%-96.4%, p = 0.0002). Further, these findings were conserved in multiple logistic regression models adjusting for treatment, age, sex, and baseline cognitive scores. In the validation cohort, TDP-43 levels were found to be significantly elevated immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass from the baseline, with a gradual decrease by postoperative day one.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that post-cardiac surgery delirium among vulnerable patients is associated with significant elevations in circulating TDP-43. This relationship suggests that TDP-43 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for acute neurological insults and blood-brain barrier integrity following cardiac surgery. Overall, our results provide mechanistic insights into the inter-relationship between postoperative delirium and subsequent cognitive impairment, potentially offering new avenues for early intervention in at-risk surgical patients.",Brain Behav Immun Health
40084671,Associations of dietary protein and amino acid intakes with disability-adjusted life years for Alzheimer's disease in Japanese people.,"BackgroundThe number of patients with dementia is increasing worldwide. In Japan, dementia is the most significant reason recognized for people requiring nursing care. Protein is one of the possible preventive nutrients for dementia; however, adequate intake levels can differ according to usual protein intakes and protein sources.ObjectiveThis study examined the relationships between disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for Alzheimer's disease and protein or amino acid intakes.MethodsGlobal Burden of Disease Study data (DALYs for each sex and age group in each year) and de-identified individual records from the National Health and Nutrition Survey Japan (data from 46,831 subjects) from 2001 to 2019 were used. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationships between DALYs and protein or amino acid intakes with lifestyle factors and sociodemographic index as confounding factors.ResultsHigher protein-to-energy ratios were correlated with lower DALYs in women in their 70 s (partial regression coefficient [Coeff.] = -349.488, p = 0.034), in men in their 60 s (Coeff. = -51.484), and in both sexes combined in their 60 s (Coeff. = -26.696, p = 0.015) even after adjusting for other possible nutrient intakes. Additionally, elevated isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine, histidine, arginine, alanine, asparagine, and glycine levels were correlated with lower DALYs in women in their 70 s (Coeff. = -2.752 to -0.141).ConclusionsAdequate protein and specific amino acid intakes may be associated with DALYs for Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis
39988644,Identification of small fiber neuropathy in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: A clinicopathological study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) manifests as dementia combined with other neurological symptoms. However, small fiber neuropathy (SFN) and pathology remain unknown in NIID.
METHODS: A total of 294 subjects, including patients with NIID, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and healthy controls (HCs), were included. Clinical scales, sensory and autonomic function testing, and skin biopsy were performed.
RESULTS: NIID patients had more severe sensory and autonomic dysfunction than other groups. Substantial reductions in intraepidermal, sweat gland, and pilomotor nerve fiber densities were observed in NIID patients, with a non-length dependent pattern. Detailed analysis revealed marked reductions in noradrenergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and regenerative nerve fibers. Small fiber densities showed high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing NIID from HCs and other diseases.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to reveal wide and severe loss of small fibers in NIID, suggesting the involvement of SFN in the pathogenesis of NIID.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our study is the first to identify wide and severe non-length dependent small fiber neuropathy in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) patients. Approximately 50% of NIID patients exhibited pure small fiber neuropathy without large fiber or mixed neuropathy. NIID patients showed a significant reduction in noradrenergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and regenerative fiber innervation. Small fiber densities, especially intraepidermal nerve fiber density, demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing NIID patients from healthy controls and other disease groups. Findings suggest that small fiber neuropathy may play a role in the pathogenesis of NIID.",Alzheimers Dement
40021051,Structures of ΔD421 Truncated Tau Fibrils.,"The microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates into pathological β-sheet amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. In these aggregates, tau is chemically modified, including abnormal hyperphosphorylation and truncation. Truncation after D421 in the C-terminal domain occurs at early stages of AD. Here we investigate the structures of ΔD421-truncated 0N4R tau fibrils assembled in vitro in the absence of anionic cofactors. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and cryoelectron microscopy, we show that ΔD421-truncated 0N4R tau forms homogeneous fibrils whose rigid core adopts a three-layered β-sheet structure that spans R2, R3 and R4 repeats. This structure is essentially identical to that of full-length tau containing phospho-mimetic mutations at the PHF1 epitope in the C-terminal domain. In comparison, a ΔD421-truncated tau that additionally contains three phospho-mimetic mutations at the AT8 epitope in the proline-rich region forms a fibril core that includes the first half of the C-terminal domain, which is excluded from all known pathological tau fibril cores. These results indicate that the posttranslational modification code of tau contains redundancy: both charge modification and truncation of the C-terminal domain promote a three-layered β-sheet structure, which resembles pathological four-repeat tau structures in several tauopathies. In comparison, reducing the positive charges at the AT8 epitope in ΔD421-truncated tau promotes a fibril core that includes an immobilized C-terminal domain. The absence of this structure in tauopathy brains implies that ΔD421 truncation does not occur in conjunction with AT8 phosphorylation in diseased brains.",J Mol Biol

Investigating AD-associated genetic loci identified in East Asian populations using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data may identify novel functional genetic contributors.
METHODS: Cell type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and peak-to-gene links were used to identify functional genes associated with 26 genetic loci from seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AD in East Asians.
RESULTS: KCNJ6 and MAPK1IP1L were identified as significant eQTLs with AD risk loci. AD risk loci were in peaks related to four genes, with CLIC4 being connected across different cell types. Genes identified in European and East Asian GWAS interacted within networks and were enriched in AD pathology pathways in astrocytes.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest KCNJ6 and CLIC4 as novel AD-associated functional genes, providing insight into the genetic architecture of AD in East Asians.
HIGHLIGHTS: Integrated functional analysis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) loci in seven East Asian genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was performed. Cell type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin peaks were used to identify AD functional genes. An AD risk variant was linked to KCNJ6 through an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell-specific eQTL. An AD risk variant maps to open chromatin, linked to CLIC4 across six cell types. Astrocyte differentially expressed genes by AD pathology are enriched in East Asian and European GWAS genes.",Alzheimers Dement

This methodology involves constructing image and gene graphs based on the image and genetic information of the subject. Graph convolution networks are then employed to extract embedded information from each graph. Enhanced diagnostic precision is achieved by utilizing self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, facilitating the fusion of multi-modal state information crucial for early AD identification.

40037055,Hyperfusion: A hypernetwork approach to multimodal integration of tabular and medical imaging data for predictive modeling.,"The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data extracted from patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit. We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods.

39983830,Toxicological mechanisms of carbon polymers in accelerating cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia and is emerging as a global threat to human health. Increased availability of processed food is identified as a crucial dietary risk factor underlying the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Carbon polymers (CPs), as neo-formed substances and ubiquitous in thermally processed foods, the relationship between them and AD onset remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The effect of CPs on AD onset was examined and the toxicological mechanisms of prolonged exposure to CPs derived from thermal processed foods on AD progression were comprehensively investigated using a scopolamine-induced neuroinflammatory cell models and the transgenic APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) AD mouse.
METHODS: The CPs were extracted from thermally processed foods and the effects of CPs exposure on oxidative stress in neuroinflammatory cells were evaluated using scopolamine-induced PC12 cells as a neuroinflammation model. Furthermore, APP/PS1 AD mice were used to validate the potential adverse impacts of prolonged exposure to CPs on AD progression through the Morris water maze and open field test. In addition, histopathological examination, including immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and H&E, of the brain tissue in AD mice after chronic CPs treatment was performed to elucidate the underlying risk of dietary exposure to CPs on AD progression.
RESULTS: Exposure to CPs enhanced oxidative damage in neuroinflammatory cells, as demonstrated by impaired mitochondrial function and activated NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways. Further results from electron spin resonance substantiated the catalytic properties of CPs, which accelerated oxidative damage through promoting free radical generation. Using transgenic AD mice model, our findings also demonstrated that prolonged CPs exposure aggravated AD-associated pathology, as evidenced by increased amyloid-beta deposition and glial cell activation, ultimately accelerating cognitive decline.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide compelling evidence of the potential health risks associated with long-term dietary exposure to CPs and provide insight into the relationship between foodborne risk factors and neurodegenerative diseases.",J Adv Res

40138406,Activity-dependent regulation of Cdc42 by Ephexin5 drives synapse growth and stabilization.,"Synaptic Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) play vital roles in regulating the activity-dependent neuronal plasticity that is critical for learning. Ephexin5, a RhoGEF implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and Angelman syndrome, was originally reported in neurons as a RhoA-specific GEF that negatively regulates spine synapse density. Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5's role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning.",Sci Adv
40004695,"Essential Tremor and Mortality in Older Adults: The Role of Word Recall, a Measure of Episodic Memory, in a 23-Year Follow-Up Study.","Background: The association between essential tremor (ET) and mortality risk remains uncertain. This study investigated the impact of episodic memory performance, measured through a word recall task, on mortality risk in ET within the Neurological Disorders in Central Spain (NEDICES) cohort, a population-based study of older adults. Methods: Participants were followed until death or 31 December 2017, and divided into four groups based on ET status and memory performance (errors in the 37-Minimental Examination's three-word recall task). Cox proportional hazards models estimated mortality hazard ratios (HRs), and the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI) assessed additive interactions. Results: Among 3998 participants, 3432 (85.8%) died over a median follow-up of 11.2 years. ET patients with episodic memory impairments had a higher mortality risk (HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06-1.46) compared with controls with similar deficits (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09-1.28), whereas no significant increase was observed for ET patients without memory impairments (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.74-1.21). RERI analysis revealed no significant additive interaction between ET and memory impairment (fully adjusted RERI: 0.11 [95% CI: -0.19-0.41]). Episodic memory impairments, regardless of ET status, were strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease as a primary cause of death. Conclusions: These findings highlight the independent contribution of episodic memory impairment to increased mortality risk, with ET modestly amplifying this effect without significant interaction. Further research is needed to explore shared pathophysiological mechanisms between ET and neurodegenerative conditions.",J Clin Med

40016783,Probing locus coeruleus functional network in healthy aging and its association with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers using pupillometry.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and the early detection of the disease-associated changes allows early interventions. The locus coeruleus (LC) has been reported to be the first brain region to develop tau pathology in AD. However, the functional brain network of the LC in both healthy aging and AD pathology is largely unknown due to technical difficulties associated with the small size of the LC. In this study, we used the measurement of spontaneous pupil constriction/dilation as a surrogate for LC activity to study LC brain network changes during healthy aging.
METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy younger and thirty-nine healthy older adults were included from the Emory Healthy Brain Study and underwent resting-state functional MRI while simultaneously tracking pupil diameter. The measurements of pupil diameter dynamics were used as reference signals in brain connectivity analysis. The connectivity of the identified networks was then compared between younger and older participants. Correlations of the identified regions with neuropsychological assessments and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were also evaluated.
RESULTS: A brain network of 20 clusters associated with pupil diameter dynamics was identified, including the LC as well as brain regions functionally connected to the LC. The pupil diameter network was found to positively correlate with the salience network and negatively correlate with the central executive network. Functional connectivity decreased within the pupil diameter network with healthy aging. The pupil diameter connectivity was associated with memory, executive, and visuospatial functioning. CSF total tau closely correlated with pupil diameter network.
CONCLUSIONS: Pupil diameter dynamics provide valuable insights into LC-related processes. While they are not solely influenced by LC activity, spontaneous pupil constrictor/dilatory activity shows promise as a non-invasive approach to probe the LC network and warrants further studies to evaluate its value as an early biomarker of AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther
40145397,Intraneuronal Aβ accumulation causes tau hyperphosphorylation via endolysosomal leakage.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau. Many attempts have been made to clarify the link between Aβ and tau in the pathogenesis, but conclusive data describing a pathway for this connection are still lacking.
METHODS: We developed a neuronal model of Aβ-induced toxicity and studied downstream effects of intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation on tau hyperphosphorylation using confocal microscopy and live cell imaging.
RESULTS: Aβ42 added to the medium was endocytosed into neurons, inducing the formation of endolysosomal protofibrils and endolysosomal leakage, which in turn promoted tau hyperphosphorylation. Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) was released from the disrupted lysosomes, and inhibition of this peptidase activity reduced tau hyperphosphorylation.
DISCUSSION: The data suggest a mechanism of AD in which Aβ42 accumulates and aggregates gradually in neurons over time, leading to endolysosomal leakage and release of AEP, which subsequently triggers tau hyperphosphorylation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Aβ42 endocytosis leads to its endolysosomal accumulation in neurons over time. Aβ42 polymerizes into protofibrils and causes endolysosomal leakage. Tau hyperphosphorylation is induced by endolysosomal asparagine endopeptidase leakage. Tau hyperphosphorylation is inhibited by an asparagine endopeptidase inhibitor.",Alzheimers Dement
40109392,Impact of Climate Change on Health and Drug Demand.,"It is anticipated that extreme weather events due to climate change will increase the prevalence of a number of acute and chronic diseases. As a result, the demand for drugs to prevent or treat those conditions is likely to increase. If the anticipated increase in demand for these drugs is not planned for, already strained medical supply chains will be further strained, resulting in poor health outcomes among affected patient populations and additional costs to health systems. The authors of this study estimated how the anticipated effects of climate change on the prevalence of a sample of four chronic conditions-cardiovascular disease (CVD), asthma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and Alzheimer's disease-will affect demand for the drugs needed to treat them (metoprolol, albuterol, heparin, and donepezil, respectively). To generate these estimates, the authors conducted an environmental scan of the peer-reviewed and gray literature and developed a medical condition-specific systems dynamics model. The model can help inform policies for ensuring drug supply under various climate scenarios.",Rand Health Q
39982268,Trends and Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease Mortality in the United States: The Impact of COVID-19.,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth leading cause of death for Americans older than 65. Though fluctuations have been noticed over the past two decades, the mortality of Alzheimer's patients increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore the temporal trends in AD-associated mortality (ADAM) and disparities in these trends, and we aim to discern changes to these trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The CDC WONDER Multiple Cause-of-Death Public Use Records from 1999 to 2022 were used to extract population data on deaths related to AD and stratify them based on age, biological sex, race, ethnicity, place of death, census region, and state. ICD-10 codes G30.0, G30.1, G30.8, and G30.9 were used to identify AD-related mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the Joinpoint Regression Program version 5.0.2. Results: We confirmed an increase in mortality rate in all races, sexes, places of death, age groups above 65, and states/census regions. Interestingly, the age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) of AD was consistently higher in females compared to males. Non-Hispanic whites had the highest AD mortality by race and ethnicity. At the intersection of race and biological sex, White females had the highest AAMR with AD. Lastly, we noted an increase in AD mortality at hospice facilities as compared to other places of death. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the number of deaths due to AD was exacerbated by the recent pandemic and that White females were disproportionately affected. The disparities relating to ADAM uncovered in this study may assist healthcare administrators and policymakers in their decisions. Additionally, the findings might help initiate larger studies focusing on these disparities to explore novel risk/prognostic factors for AD.",NeuroSci

40147827,Association of Physical Activity with Dementia Risk in Cancer Survivors: A Korean Nationwide Cohort Study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of physical activity on dementia risk among cancer survivors in South Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, population-based cohort study included 344,152 cancer survivors identified from the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. The mean follow-up time was 5.81 years. Different levels of physical activity post-cancer diagnosis, ranging from inactive to highly active, were assessed. The primary outcome was the incidence of overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD). Secondary outcomes included dementia risk stratified by cancer type and treatment (chemotherapy and radiation).
RESULTS: Of the total participants, 24,363 (7.08%) developed dementia. The risk of overall dementia decreased sequentially across the exercise groups compared to the inactive group: insufficiently active (adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86-0.92), active (adjusted HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88), and highly active (adjusted HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.82). This inverse relationship between exercise and dementia risk was statistically significant across various cancer types and was consistent regardless of age, comorbidities, and whether or not excluding the first 1, 2 years.
CONCLUSION: Among cancer survivors in South Korea, increased physical activity post-diagnosis was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia. These findings underscore the importance of promoting physical activity in cancer survivors for cognitive health.",Cancer Res Treat
40118715,Maximizing the benefit and managing the risk of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Strategies and research directions.,"Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs) have introduced a new era of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics with disease-targeted drugs. Three agents --- aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab --- have been approved and others are in development. These agents are administered intravenously, once in the brain they activate microglia to engulf amyloid-beta protein fibrillar plaques. Each approved agent has a specific profile of administration, titration, amyloid target, and adverse events. In 18 month trials of participants with early AD (defined as mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia), anti-amyloid MABs slow cognitive and functional decline by approximately 30 ​%. Amyloid positron emission tomography reveals marked reductions in amyloid plaque burden; reductions below a threshold of 15-25 Centiloids are associated with clinical benefit. The magnitude, scope, and trajectory of clinical end points provide the basis for interpretations of clinical meaningfulness. Occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with intracerebral edema, microhemorrhages, or superficial siderosis must be monitored and managed to prevent serious or rare catastrophic consequences. Infusion reactions occur and anticipatory management is required. Development of subcutaneous formulations and use of blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring promises to increase the accessibility and decrease the demands on health care systems associated with these agents.

40034447,Does an Audio Wearable Lead to Agitation Reduction in Dementia: The Memesto AWARD Proof-of-Principle Clinical Research Study.,"BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common behavioral symptom in persons living with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD), especially in the setting of residential care. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions are limited. Memesto is a wearable audio device designed to provide messages and music that can be scheduled or played on demand. The objective of this proof-of-principle study was to quantify whether Memesto can reduce agitation in persons with AD/ADRD.
METHODS: Persons living with AD/ADRD with a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) average score of 4 or greater, one informal caregiver, and one formal caregiver (triad) were recruited from residential care facilities in the Midwest region of the United States. After consent and a two-week training period, the triad was monitored every two weeks from Baseline to Week 10 with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) agitation domain subscale (primary endpoint) and the CGI-S scale (secondary endpoint) with the last observation carried forward. The average score on the NPI agitation domain subscale and the CGI-S scale at Baseline and Week 10 as rated by the two caregivers were compared. A 30% drop in the NPI agitation domain subscale in 50% of the persons living with AD/ADRD was considered a clinically meaningful finding.
RESULTS: Over thirteen months of recruitment, 9 triads were identified in 6 residential care facilities in three Midwestern states. For the NPI agitation domain, 6 of 9 (67%) persons with AD/ADRD had a 30% reduction in the average caregiver ratings at Week 10. No adverse events were identified associated with the use of the device. Device usability was rated as positive based on a survey.
DISCUSSION: This study provided quantitative data on psychometrically sound agitation scales regarding a 10-week treatment course with Memesto after a two-week training period. The results were limited by the inability to recruit the desired set of 20 triads due to disruptions in care and staff at residential care facilities. Further effectiveness testing in a larger cohort with a sham control device is necessary.

40038506,Characterizing heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease progression: a semiparametric model.,"The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia worldwide, is known for its variability and complexity, challenging the conventional methods of monitoring and predicting disease trajectories. This study introduces a semiparametric modeling approach to analyze longitudinal cognitive and imaging data. We studied two different outcome variables from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database: the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS13) scores and ventricular volumes [Formula: see text]. Unlike traditional linear mixed effects models, semiparametric models do not assume a linear AD progression over time. Semiparametric models offer the advantage of capturing the non-linear features of AD progression, such as cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, represented by changes in ADAS13 scores and ventricular enlargement, respectively. By integrating regression splines and mixed modeling techniques, we provide a nuanced understanding of AD progression that captures the heterogeneity of disease trajectories. Our analysis reveals variations in the timing and degree of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration among AD patients, underlining the need for personalized approaches for monitoring and managing AD. This study's findings contribute to the modeling of AD progression and offer potential implications for interventions and prognostic assessments in clinical and research settings.",Sci Rep
39987247,Fokker-Planck diffusion maps of microglial transcriptomes reveal radial differentiation into substates associated with Alzheimer's pathology.,"The identification of microglia subtypes is important for understanding the role of innate immunity in neurodegenerative diseases. Current methods of unsupervised cell type identification assume a small noise-to-signal ratio of transcriptome measurements to produce well-separated cell clusters. However, identification of subtypes can be obscured by gene expression noise, which diminishes the distances in transcriptome space between distinct cell types, blurs boundaries, and reduces reproducibility. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion maps to model cellular differentiation as a stochastic process whereby cells settle into local minima that correspond to cell subtypes, in a potential landscape constructed from transcriptome data using a nearest neighbor graph approach. By applying critical transition fields, we identify individual cells on the verge of transitioning between subtypes, revealing microglial cells in an inactivated, homeostatic state before radially transitioning into various specialized subtypes. Specifically, we show that cells from Alzheimer's disease patients are enriched in a microglia subtype associated to antigen presentation and T-cell recruitment, and are depleted in an anti-inflammatory subtype.",Commun Biol
40119098,Klotho antiaging protein: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential in diseases.,"Klotho, initially introduced as an anti-aging protein, is expressed in the brain, pancreas, and most prominently in the kidney. The two forms of Klotho (membrane-bound and soluble form) have diverse pharmacological functions such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-fibrotic, tumour-suppressive etc. The membrane-bound form plays a pivotal role in maintaining kidney homeostasis by regulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) signalling, vitamin D metabolism and phosphate balance. Klotho deficiency has been linked with significantly reduced protection against various kidney pathological phenotypes, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is a major cause of chronic kidney disease leading to end-stage kidney disease. Owing to the pleiotropic actions of klotho, it has shown beneficial effects in DKD by tackling the complex pathophysiology and reducing kidney inflammation, oxidative stress, as well as fibrosis. Moreover, the protective effect of klotho extends beyond DKD in other pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, alzheimer's disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. Therefore, this review summarizes the relationship between Klotho expression and various diseases with a special emphasis on DKD, the distinct mechanisms and the potential of exogenous Klotho supplementation as a therapeutic strategy. Future research into exogenous Klotho could unravel novel treatment avenues for DKD and other diseases.",Mol Biomed
40121962,Intrinsic capacity in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with those with Alzheimer's disease: A cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVES: Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual, has never been studied in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As IC decline is associated with the risk of frailty, functional decline and disability and is potentially reversible after targeted interventions, a monitoring and specific management of IC decline in patients with DLB could promote healthy aging in this population. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the frequency of IC decline in DLB and to compare it with AD.
DESIGN: A single-center cross-sectional study.
SETTING: This study was carried out in a memory clinic between 2015 and 2023 based on the MEMORA cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a diagnosis of AD or probable DLB and a comprehensive geriatric assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: IC was assessed according to the WHO model in 4 domains: vitality assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), locomotion assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), psychology assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale 4-items (GDS-4 items), and hearing assessed by the Hearing, Vision, Equilibrium and Cognition (HVEC) scale.
RESULTS: A total of 798 patients (154 with probable DLB and 644 with AD) were included, and the mean age was 81.4 years (SD 6.33). Compared with AD patients, DLB patients had significantly more impaired IC in all domains, with greater risks of impaired vitality (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-3.72), locomotion (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.15-5.90), psychology (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.73-3.92) and hearing (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.53-3.49), according to the adjusted models. Similarly, when IC domains were considered linear variables, IC across all domains was significantly lower in the DLB group than in the AD group.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that DLB patients presented a greater decrease in IC than did AD patients across all domains. In memory clinics, DLB patients could be offered systematic and early IC monitoring and personalized interventions.",J Nutr Health Aging
39975468,Meaningful to whom? Minimal clinically important differences and the priorities of individuals living with dementia for everyday function.,"UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a significant impact on an individual's functional cognitive abilities, highlighting the need to prioritize measures of function in evaluating minimally clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in AD/ADRD research. Input directly from individuals living with AD/ADRD on measures of function are lacking in MCID discussions, including what it means to live with AD/ADRD and what type and degree of improvements are most meaningful across the disease continuum. Most measures for assessing function in AD/ADRD trials are largely focused on basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADL, IADL), which lack aspects of everyday function that matter most to individuals living with AD/ADRD. Expanding outcome evaluation to other dimensions of everyday function and diversifying measurement approaches is essential for optimizing inclusion of personally meaningful aspects of everyday function prioritized by individuals living with AD/ADRD and improving detection of potentially more sensitive changes in functioning. This perspective outlines four directions to expand and integrate what matters most to individuals living with AD/ADRD into trial outcome evaluation, including (1) consideration of how what matters most to individuals living with AD/ADRD may change across the disease continuum from mild to advanced dementia, (2) identification and evaluation of goals around strengths-based domains such as social participation rather than solely emphasizing deficits and losses, (3) utilization of goal-attainment scaling to more specifically match individually-specific functional goals, and (4) strengthening the inclusion and use of self-report and performance-based measures of function and triangulating these measures with informant-report measures.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a significant impact on an individual' functional cognitive abilities, of which changes in these abilities are measured through detection of minimally clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds to determine the effectiveness of AD/ADRD clinical trials.Widely used measures for assessing MCID thresholds in AD/ADRD trials focus on basic and instrumental activities of daily living, presenting opportunities to expand measurement of MCID to account for other dimensions of everyday function that are prioritized by individuals living with AD/ADRD.To expand outcome evaluation and improve integration of aspects of functioning that matter most to people living with AD/ADRD, we identify opportunities to incorporate more diverse strategies via goal-attainment scaling, self-report, and performance-based measures as appropriate. We also highlight the importance of incorporating strengths-based domains such as social participation, moving beyond deficit-focused assessment of functioning.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40083551,The various roles of TREM2 in cardiovascular disease.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane immune receptor that is expressed mainly on macrophages. As a pathology-induced immune signaling hub, TREM2 senses tissue damage and activates immune remodeling in response. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the TREM2 signaling pathway in Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Recent research has indicated that TREM2 signaling is also activated in various cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we summarize the current understanding and the unanswered questions regarding the role of TREM2 signaling in mediating the metabolism and function of macrophages in atherosclerosis and various models of heart failure. In the context of atherosclerosis, TREM2 signaling promotes foam cell formation and is crucial for maintaining macrophage survival and plaque stability through efferocytosis and cholesterol efflux. Recent studies on myocardial infarction, sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive heart failure also implicated the protective role of TREM2 signaling in cardiac macrophages through efferocytosis and paracrine functions. Additionally, we discuss the clinical significance of elevated soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in cardiovascular disease and propose potential therapies targeting TREM2. The overall aim of this review is to highlight the various roles of TREM2 in cardiovascular diseases and to provide a framework for therapeutic strategies targeting TREM2.",Front Immunol
40138777,Ginkgo biloba Extract GBE50 ameliorates cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder in which neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction plays a critical role. GBE50, a refined extract of Ginkgo biloba containing over 50 % total flavonoids and terpene lactones, is widely used in the clinical prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to its anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, its specific effects on NVU integrity and cerebrovascular function in AD remain unclear.
PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of GBE50 on NVU integrity and cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model.
METHODS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated with GBE50 via intragastric administration for 10 weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed through behavioral tests, while the structural and functional integrity of the NVU was evaluated using immunofluorescence, laser speckle imaging, and in vivo multi-photon imaging. Furthermore, target prediction and transcriptomic analyses were conducted to uncover potential molecular mechanisms and identify specific targets of GBE50.
RESULTS: GBE50 treatment significantly alleviated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. It enhanced cerebrovascular structure and function by increasing vessel density, diameter, and branching, leading to improved cerebral blood flow (CBF). GBE50 also restored NVU components such as endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes, promoted parenchyma and perivascular Aβ clearance, and reduced neuroinflammation. Bioinformatics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that GBE50 exerted its effects by regulating pathways related to vascular repair, neuroprotection, and Aβ clearance.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that GBE50 improves cognitive dysfunction in AD by restoring NVU integrity and cerebrovascular function through multi-target mechanisms. This study highlights the potential of GBE50 as a promising therapeutic approach for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases involved in cerebrovascular dysfunction.",Phytomedicine
40098618,SysNatMed: rational natural medicine discovery by systems genetics.,"BACKGROUND: Although acknowledged as an important complement to modern medicine, the utility of natural medicine (NM) remains under-exploited. We aimed to develop a novel data-driven approach for natural medicine discovery.
METHODS: GWAS summary statistics of disease (Alzheimer's disease, i.e., AD, for the case study) and quantitative trait loci were collected from public sources. The ranking of disease-gene associations was established using summary-based Mendelian randomization. The comprehensive hierarchical relationships among ingredients, natural products, and target genes were compiled from the BATMAN-TCM v2.0 database. Based on the ranking of disease-gene associations and the comprehensive hierarchical relationships among ingredients, natural products, and target genes, we prioritized NM ingredients as potential candidates for AD management and examined the efficacy for AD prevention using rat AD models.
RESULTS: We developed a non-trivial transparent data-driven framework for systems genetics-based NM discovery. Among the 139 prioritized candidates for AD management, we demonstrated the efficacy of Dang Gui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix, ASR) and Dang Shen (Codonopsis Pilosula, CP) for AD prevention using rat models. Mechanistically, we showed that ASR may prevent AD-related damage through protection of neural cells, as well as inhibition of microglia, angiogenesis, inflammation, and extracellular matrices.
CONCLUSION: Our method holds potential for the development of new strategies of complementary medicine for disease treatment and prevention, especially for complex conditions involving a number of genes.",Front Pharmacol
40034352,Centella asiatica improves cognitive function and alters the hippocampal metabolome of aged Tg2576 and wild-type mice.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health problem in the aging population, with limited treatment options. We previously reported that Centella asiatica herb water extract (CAW) attenuates cognitive decline in murine models of AD and aging.
OBJECTIVE: To explore changes in the hippocampal metabolome associated with CAW's modulation of cognitive function and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque load in aged Tg2576 and wild-type (WT) mice.
METHODS: We compared cognitive function, hippocampal Aβ plaque burden, and hippocampal metabolite profile in 20-month-old Tg2576 female mice and their WT littermates following 3-5 weeks treatment with CAW (0, 200, or 1000 mg/kg/d p.o.). Cognitive testing included contextual fear response (CFR) and novel object recognition task (NORT). Aβ plaque burden was measured via immunohistochemistry. Metabolomic profiles of mouse hippocampi were obtained using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: CAW treatment resulted in dose-related improvements in CFR and NORT performance of Tg2576 and WT mice. However, while CFR correlated with neurosignaling and glycosylated ceramide levels, NORT performance correlated with lysophosphatidylcholines and oxidized metabolites, and Aβ accumulation was linked to elevated excitatory and suppressed inhibitory neurotransmission. Only a subset of the metabolite changes induced by CAW in Tg2576 mice represented a reversal of metabolite differences between Tg2576 and WT mice, suggesting the involvement of other pathways in CAW's cognitive effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms underlying CAW's cognitive effects extend beyond reversing metabolic effects of Aβ accumulation. The data support the potential use of CAW to manage memory challenges in aged individuals with or without AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40047119,"A Proteomics Profiling Reveals the Neuroprotective Effects of Melatonin on Exogenous β-amyloid-42 Induced Mitochondrial Impairment, Intracellular β-amyloid Accumulation and Tau Hyperphosphorylation in Human SH-SY5Y Cells.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is prevalent in the elderly population and characterized by the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau proteins, and extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Aβ). The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of melatonin on Aβ42-induced AD-like pathology in SH-SY5Y cell lines. To assess the effects of melatonin on Aβ42-exposed cells, we performed a proteomics analysis of altered protein expression in Aβ42-treated cells, with or without melatonin Pretreatment, using label-free nano-LC-MS/MS. Experimental validations of pathways related to the neuroprotective effects of melatonin were carried out using Milliplex amyloid beta and tau magnetic bead assays, Western blot analysis, and measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS levels. Our results show that Aβ42 exposure led to an increase in an accumulation of intracellular Aβ42/40 and phosphorylated tau (Thr181)/Tau ratios. Pretreatment with melatonin effectively reduced the levels of these pathogenic proteins. Proteomics analysis has revealed protein markers associated with the Alzheimer's disease pathway, neuronal synapses, cellular apoptosis, and mitochondrial functions. Changes in proteins regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, the electron transport chain, and mitochondrial oxidative stress were observed in Aβ42-treated cells. Pretreatment with melatonin protected the cells against Aβ42-induced cellular damages by regulating the expression of several proteins underpinning these biological processes, including the suppression of mitochondrial ROS generation and mitigation of mitochondrial membrane depolarization.",Cell Biol Int
40018776,Prolonged Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Does not Exacerbate Tau Pathology in a Tauopathy Mouse Model.,"BACKGROUND: Several preclinical studies have reported elevated levels of tau following the induction of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. The objective of this study was to first induce CCH in a mouse model of tauopathy over an extended period of up to 6 months and to subsequently investigate the effects of CCH on tau accumulation and alterations in the transcriptome.
METHODS: Three-month-old P301S tauopathy mice were randomly allocated to either a Sham or CCH group. The common carotid arteries (CCAs) of the CCH group were bilaterally implanted using 0.75-mm inner diameter ameroid constrictors. Prior to surgery, Doppler ultrasound imaging was acquired, with follow-up imaging at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Brain tissue samples were obtained, and hemispheres were dissected and divided for separate analysis.
RESULT: No significant differences in phosphorylated and total tau protein levels were found in either Sham or CCH left cortical hemispheres or hippocampal lysates. Immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated tau in the right hemisphere revealed similar findings. Compared with the Sham group, transcriptomic deconvolution revealed a significant reduction of memory B cells in the CCH group (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSION: To clarify the effects of chronic hypoperfusion on tau pathology, more than one surgical method of hypoperfusion should be used in future studies.",J Integr Neurosci
40034281,Exploration of natural products for the development of promising cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Cholinesterase enzymes (BuChE and AChE) are privileged biological targets for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes has been proven to improve the neurotransmission mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease patients. In this investigation, we attempt to highlight new cholinesterase inhibitors from natural products. For this purpose, secondary metabolites (299 phytoconstituents) of twenty-eight Medicinal plants were virtually screened using molecular docking, pharmacokinetic and toxicological analysis. Ten phytoconstituents (L82, L86, L92, L121, L148, L187, L211, L221, L228) exhibited their high binding affinity with BuChE, and five phytoconstituents, namely L119, L147, L149, L192 and L193, exhibited their strong binding ability with AChE. Subsequently, these phytoconstituents were evaluated for their ADMET properties. As result, L221 is predicted to be highly bioavailable and readily absorbed by the human intestinal tract without significant toxicity concerns, making it suitable for oral administration. Crucially, it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing it to effectively reach the central nervous system. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA analysis revealed that the best-screened phytoconstituent form thermodynamically favorable and stable complex with the BuChE binding site. The conducted investigations highlighted promising outcomes that can orient towards the rational development of effective Cholinesterase inhibitors.",Heliyon
40145305,Novel blood-based proteomic signatures across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to support early and accurate diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sensitive to molecular pathology and are predictive of outcome. We evaluated a novel multiplex proteomic method in people with diverse neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: Serum from people with Alzheimer's disease (N = 36), Lewy body dementia (N = 34), frontotemporal dementia (N = 36), and progressive supranuclear palsy (N = 36) and age-matched controls (N = 30) was analyzed with the nucleic acid linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) central nervous system panel (≈ 120 analytes) and inflammation panel (250 analytes). Biomarkers were compared across groups and included as predictors of survival.
RESULTS: The NULISA panels demonstrated high sensitivity and reliability for detecting multiple biomarkers across neurodegenerative disorders. There were condition-specific proteomic biomarkers, while neurofilament light chain, corticotropin-releasing hormone, CD276, and a data-driven inflammation pattern were significant transdiagnostic outcome predictors.
DISCUSSION: The sensitive NULISA multiplex approach supports differential diagnosis and target identification, with prognostically informative dementia-related biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: We tested the novel technology nucleic acid linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) in people with diverse neurodegenerative diseases, which demonstrated high sensitivity and reliability for detecting multiple biomarkers in serum samples. We compared the NULISA central nervous system serum results to single molecule array (Simoa) plasma assays for phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau231, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein, finding strong correlations. Increased levels of serum NfL were identified across all patient groups and most elevated in the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cohorts, while p-tau epitopes were the most significant markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia. Patients with FTD and PSP showed upregulation of many inflammation markers, compared to controls and patients with AD. We found condition-specific proteomic biomarkers, while NfL, corticotropin-releasing hormone, CD276, and data-driven immune signatures were significant transdiagnostic predictors of clinical outcomes (survival rates).",Alzheimers Dement
40012393,Use of Virtual Reality to Improve Spatial Orientation in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, neurodegenerative condition that leads to a significant cognitive decline. One of the symptoms that greatly reduces the quality of daily functioning is the deterioration of spatial orientation abilities. A non-pharmacological treatment option for Alzheimer's disease, which is also employed to improve the cognitive functioning of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, is virtual reality training.
OBJECTIVE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no existing systematic review on the use of virtual reality training to enhance spatial orientation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. The review was therefore conducted to fill this gap. The findings of this review may support the efficacy of virtual reality in enhancing spatial orientation.
METHODS: Five databases were searched. The primary inclusion criteria were study participants aged over 60 years with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment and the use of virtual reality for improving spatial orientation. Six studies meeting these criteria were ultimately included in the review.
RESULTS: All included studies demonstrated an improvement in the spatial orientation of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment following virtual reality training. This indicates the effectiveness of virtual reality technology in cognitive rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: As virtual reality cognitive training has proven effective, its use should be more widely adopted. Further research on the application of virtual reality for enhancing spatial orientation in individuals with dementia is recommended.",Curr Alzheimer Res
40107109,Intracellular anionic substances cause tau liquid-liquid phase separation.,"Tau protein aggregation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Niemann-Pick disease type C. Liquid-liquid phase separation has emerged as a key mechanism in the early stages of protein aggregation for these disorders. Tau protein incubated with heparin undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation to form liquid droplets in vitro. However, whether tau liquid droplet formation occurs in vivo remains unresolved. To investigate cellular conditions that promote tau droplet formation, we treated tau-expressing human embryonic kidney 293T cells with reagents that introduced anionic substances or induced intracellular vesicle accumulation. Suppression of Niemann-Pick disease type C1 protein, a lysosomal membrane protein involved in mediating intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or the introduction of negatively charged dextran into cultured cells, increased the formation of tau-positive puncta with liquid droplet characteristics in a concentration-dependent manner. After prolonged observation, these puncta transitioned from a dynamic liquid state to a more solid-like gel phase, indicating progressive aggregation. Our findings suggest that intracellular enrichment of negatively charged substances or vesicles induces tau phase separation, potentially contributing to its pathological aggregation. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun
40055261,SP3-Mediated Transcriptional Activation of GRIK1 is Involved in Alzheimer's Disease-Induced Cognitive Decline by Inducing Inflammasome Activation in Microglia.,"GRIK1 has been identified to suppress the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The present study investigated the damaging effect of GRIK1 on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, by focusing on inflammasome. APP-PS1 mice were subjected to a Y-maze test and a Morris water maze test. APP-PS1 mice with GRIK1 knockdown were constructed using adeno-associated virus, and the effects of GRIK1 knockdown on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia of brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice were analyzed. Mouse primary microglia BV2 was induced by LPS, and Western blot, flow cytometry, and ELISA were performed. GRIK1 was significantly elevated in the brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice. GRIK1 knockdown inhibited the neuronal damage and NLRP3 neuroinflammation in the brain tissues and improved cognitive dysfunction of APP-PS1 mice. Knockdown of GRIK1 inhibited activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in BV2 cells. SP3 was upregulated in the brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice, and SP3 promoted GRIK1 transcription by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of GRIK1 reversed the mitigating effect of knockdown of SP3 on cognitive dysfunction and NLRP3 activation in APP-PS1 mice. Overall, our results revealed that SP3-induced GRIK1 transcription potentiates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia, leading to cognitive dysfunction in AD.",Neuromolecular Med

40025720,IL-34/TREM2 modulates microglia-mediated inflammation and provides neuroprotection in a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: As a recently identified cytokine, interleukin-34 (IL-34) is predominantly produced by neurons and functions as a modulator for glial functions. Emerging evidence indicates that IL-34 exerted neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanism remained elusive.
OBJECTIVE: To uncover the mechanisms by which IL-34 provides neuroprotection in AD.
METHODS: Using senescence-accelerated mouse prone substrain 8 (SAMP8) mice, a well-established model for sporadic AD, we investigated the dynamic changes in brain IL-34 concentrations during AD progression. Afterwards, SAMP8 mice received a 4-week continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of IL-34. Morris water maze test was employed to assess the spatial cognitive functions. Neuronal and synaptic markers, oxidative stress makers, pro-inflammatory cytokines and glial activation markers in the brains of SAMP8 mice were measured. Finally, amyloid-β (Aβ)<sub>42</sub>-stimulated primary microglia, lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown strategy and co-immunoprecipitation assay were utilized to uncover the possible mechanisms by which IL-34 exerted neuroprotection in AD.
RESULTS: In SAMP8 mice, we revealed that brain IL-34 concentrations gradually decreased during AD progression. A 4-week continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of IL-34 rescued spatial cognitive impairments, ameliorated neuronal and synaptic damage, and suppressed oxidative stress and microglia-mediated inflammation in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Using Aβ<sub>42</sub>-stimulated primary microglia, we demonstrated for the first time that IL-34 suppressed microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines release by interacting with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a key regulator of microglial functions.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover the mechanisms by which IL-34 provides neuroprotection in AD, indicating that IL-34/TREM2 signaling may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for this devastating disease.",J Alzheimers Dis
40149843,Murine Non-Transgenic Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology: Focus on Risk Factors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant challenge among neurodegenerative disorders, as effective treatments and therapies remain largely undeveloped. Despite extensive research efforts employing various methodologies and diverse genetic models focused on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, the research for effective therapeutic strategies remains inconclusive. The key pathological features of AD include Aβ senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and the activation of neuroinflammatory pathways. Presently, investigations into AD and assessing potential treatments predominantly utilize Aβ transgenic models. Conversely, non-transgenic models may provide valuable insights into the multifaceted pathological states associated with AD. Thus, these models may serve as practical complementary tools for evaluating therapeutic and intervention strategies, since the primary AD risk factors are most frequently modeled. This review aims to critically assess the existing literature on AD non-transgenic models induced by streptozotocin, scopolamine, aging, mechanical stress, metals, and dietary patterns to enhance their application in AD research.",Brain Sci
40114609,Chronic alcohol exposure during young adulthood attenuates microglial reactivity and downstream immune response pathways in a mouse model of tauopathy later in life.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by the buildup of amyloid-β and tau protein tangles. Alcohol use has been identified as a risk factor for AD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this potential causal link remain elusive. An emerging area of research focuses on the role of microglia, the brain's innate immune cells, in AD pathogenesis, with evidence suggesting that alcohol exposure may prime microglia to exhibit an exaggerated immune response when they are subsequently exposed to proinflammatory stimuli.
METHODS: We used a single 10-day chronic-plus-binge alcohol exposure model in male and female C57BL/6J mice aged 8-10 weeks One month later, tauopathy was induced via adenoviral vector (AAV)-mediated overexpression of h-p301L Tau. After 2.5 months, the mice underwent behavioral and cognitive testing. Two weeks later, microglia were collected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and processed for unbiased, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to determine the molecular pathways related to microglial reactivity.
RESULTS: Microglia from mice exposed to alcohol in young adulthood exhibited a blunted immune response when challenged with AAV-mediated delivery and accumulation of human tau later in life. This was characterized by decreased expression of MHC II- and interferon-associated proteins and bioinformatic prediction of inhibited inflammation-related pathways in the absence of gross histological, behavioral, or cognitive deficits. These results demonstrate unique, temporally specific microglial reactivity to tau that is modulated by early adulthood alcohol exposure, implicating a microglial response that could negatively affect the mechanisms necessary for tau clearance and potentially exacerbate tau pathogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into the long-term effects of alcohol exposure in early adulthood on microglial function and the complexity of context-dependent microglial involvement in tauopathy. Consideration of early-adulthood environmental factors is critical for understanding and potentially mitigating the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.",Alcohol Clin Exp Res (Hoboken)
40026008,Effects of exercise on older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a significantly elevated risk of progressing to AD. In recent years, accumulating evidence has indicated that exercise interventions may mitigate cognitive decline in individuals with MCI and reduce the risk of conversion to AD, potentially through mechanisms such as enhancing cerebral blood flow and promoting neuroplasticity. Objective: To explore which type of exercise is most effective in improving global cognition in older adults with MCI and to investigate whether exercise can enhance their balance abilities. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were retrieved from four databases. Stata software was used for Network Meta-Analysis and traditional meta-analysis. Results: A total of 33 studies were included, of which 28 were used to determine the best exercise modality. The results indicated that multicomponent exercise (SUCRA = 76.5%) and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (SUCRA = 73.6%) are two effective modalities. The results of the traditional meta-analysis showed that exercise combined with cognitive training, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and land-based kayaking training can improve balance ability. Conclusions: Multicomponent exercise may be the optimal exercise modality for enhancing global cognition in older adults with MCI, and various exercise modalities can improve balance abilities. However, more studies with larger sample sizes and higher quality are needed to provide further evidence.",J Alzheimers Dis
40100818,Potential multiple disease progression pathways in female patients with Alzheimer's disease inferred from transcriptome and epigenome data of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical type of dementia for which therapeutic strategies have not yet been established. The database of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease study by the ENCODE consortium contains transcriptome and various epigenome data. Although the Rush AD database may contain a satisfactory amount of data for women, the amount of data for men remains insufficient. Here, based on an analysis of publicly available data from female patients, this study found that AD pathology appears to be nonuniform; AD patients were divided into several groups with differential gene expression patterns, including those related to cognitive function. First, cluster analysis was performed on individuals diagnosed with ""No Cognitive Impairment (NCI),"" ""Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease (AD)"" stages in clinical trials using gene expression, and multiple substages were identified across AD progression. The epigenome data, in particular genome-wide H3k4me3 distribution data, also supported the existence of multiple AD substages. However, APOE gene polymorphisms of individuals seemed to not correlate with disease stage. An inference of adjacency networks among substages, evaluated via partition-based graph abstraction using the gene expression profiles of individuals, suggested the possibility of multiple typical disease progression pathways from NCI to different AD substages through various MCI substages. These findings could refine biomarker discovery or inform personalized therapeutic approaches.",PLoS One
39981456,"The Role of PET Detection of Biomarkers in Early Diagnosis, Progression, and Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurologic disease characterized by the deposition of Aβ amyloid and tau protein in the neural tissue, which leads to gradual and irreversible deterioration of memory. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed high potential in diagnosing AD. It provided a unique opportunity to assess cerebral amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangle deposits in the brain tissue without invasive procedures in vivo. Many studies have been focused on PET diagnosis of AD in recent years, which has significantly improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. This review study aims to summarize the role and emphasize the benefits of PET detection of AD biomarkers in early stages, clinical and histological progression assessment, and predicting AD outcomes. Relevant articles published in the last five years, from September 1, 2019, to October 30, 2024, were searched through authentic databases such as PubMed, PubMed Central, Europe PubMed Central, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. In this systematic review, we included articles published in English, with available full text, based on human trials, with relevant information regarding participants who underwent PET of the brain to diagnose AD biomarkers. The study strictly followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and recommendations. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal methods were used to evaluate all selected cross-sectional research, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the cohort and longitudinal studies. Eleven relevant articles were included in this systematic review, and 2,203 males and females participated. The study revealed that the detection of beta-amyloid PET showed high-precious results in early diagnosis of AD. The detection of tau protein showed a high potential for estimation of the clinical and histological progression and prognosis of AD in longitudinal studies. Identifying amyloid and tau protein accumulation and glucose metabolism alterations is highly predictive of neurodegeneration in preclinical and mild cognitive impairment stages.",Cureus
40133253,Performance of plasma biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of dementia in a Brazilian cohort.,"Despite remarkable progress in the biomarker field in recent years, local validation of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia is still lacking in Latin America. In this longitudinal cohort study of 145 elderly Brazilians, we assess the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers, based on clinical diagnosis and CSF biomarker positivity. Follow-up data of up to 4.7 years were used to determine performance in predicting diagnostic conversions. Participants were clinically categorized as cognitively unimpaired (n = 49), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 29), AD (n = 38), Lewy body dementia (n = 22), or vascular dementia (n = 7). Plasma Tau, Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, NfL, GFAP, pTau231, pTau181 and pTau217 were measured on the SIMOA HD-X platform. Plasma pTau217 showed excellent performance determining CSF biomarker status in the cohort, either alone (ROC AUC = 0.94, 95% CI: [0.88-1.00]) or as a ratio to Aβ<sub>42</sub> (ROC AUC = 0.98, 95% CI: [0.94-1.00]).

40132750,Preventive effects of xanthohumol in APP/PS1 mice based on multi-omics atlas.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with unknown etiology and pathogenesis. We described a combined analysis of murine proteomics and microbiomics to find potential therapeutic targets of different doses of xanthohumol (Xn), with the goal of providing a biological basis for the treatment of early AD. Xn improved the spatial learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice; this was associated with an increased number of newborn neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) and a decreased inflammatory response. 108 proteins were significantly changed after 0.5 mg/kg Xn treatment while only 72 proteins changed by 5 mg/kg Xn. Eight significant microbiota were modulated by different doses of Xn at line discriminant analysis (LDA) score 3.0, but only three of which were regulated by 0.5 mg/kg Xn at LDA score 4.0. In addition, Xn treatment could significantly regulate the pathways of neurodegeneration- multiple diseases in the hippocampus and the penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis and atrazine degradation pathways in the gut. Interestingly, Nefl protein validated by correlation analysis was found in the common signaling pathway. 0.5 mg/kg Xn was able to reverse the correlation between hippocampal proteins and gut microbiota. Xn treatment significantly improved cognitive function in AD transgenic mice. Different doses of Xn caused significant differences in protein expression and flora composition and abundance, suggesting that the doses of Xn should be selected with caution, and low dose may be better in the prevention of AD.",Brain Res Bull
40061847,A Narrative Review of Community-Based Epidemiological Studies on Parkinson's Disease in India.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition, following Alzheimer's disease. Worldwide, the prevalence of PD differs among various populations and geographical areas. In our nation, there is a paucity of population-based epidemiological research that can effectively ascertain the prevalence of PD. In this review article, we have attempted to examine the prevalence rates gathered from the neuro-epidemiological studies in India.  We searched for published articles on the prevalence rate of PD in India from PubMed and Google Scholar, using the keywords ""prevalence"", ""burden"", ""epidemiology"", ""Parkinson's disease"", and ""India"". The review includes all the community-based studies that calculated the prevalence rate of PD. There are few community-based studies on the prevalence rate of PD. The observed prevalence rates vary a lot in urban and rural areas; also, urban areas show higher prevalence rates than rural areas. Some studies suggest that Parkinson's disease is more common among males, while others indicate a higher prevalence among females. Almost all research suggests that the prevalence rate increases with age for both males and females. The study carried out at the senior care facility revealed that the elderly had a limited understanding of Parkinson's disease. Epidemiological studies on PD are crucial to expanding our knowledge about PD. Given the variations in regions, ethnic groups, and cultures, conducting a comprehensive nationwide multi-center study is essential to investigate the prevalence and factors contributing to PD. Initiatives to raise awareness about PD are also the need of the hour.",Cureus
40079781,Vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: Exploring the potential of aerobic and resistance exercises as therapeutic strategies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, as a result of cognitive decline and neurological dysfunction. In AD, reduced cerebral blood flow and impaired vascularization result from capillary bed degeneration and decreased angiogenesis, as observed in both patients and animal models. Physical exercise is recognized as a potential intervention to delay AD progression and reduce disease risk. While most studies have focused on the benefits of aerobic exercise (AE), emerging evidence suggests that resistance exercise (RE) also exerts positive effects on overall health and cognitive function in aging and AD. However, a notable gap in knowledge remains regarding the effects of RE on cerebral blood flow and vascular structure. This review explores the processes by which AE and RE influence brain vascularization in aging and AD, including blood flow, endothelial function, angiogenesis and neurotrophic factor levels. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, we conclude that both AE and RE contribute to improved cerebral blood flow and vascular function, promoting vascular repair in the aging and AD-affected brain. By examining the relationship between exercise modalities and brain vascularization, this review expands knowledge regarding the processes underlying the neuroprotective effects of exercise in neurodegenerative and aging conditions.",J Alzheimers Dis
40005082,Identification and Therapeutic Potential of Polymethoxylated Flavones in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium for Alzheimer's Disease: Targeting Neuroinflammation.,"Neuroinflammation is a significant driving force in the pathogenesis and progression of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), the key lipid-soluble constituents in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP), exhibit excellent blood-brain barrier permeability and anti-inflammatory properties, holding therapeutic potential for CNS disorders. However, the specific bioactive components and therapeutic effects of PMFs in treating CNS disorders are not well understood. This study employed a comprehensive sequential metabolism approach to elucidate the dynamic biotransformation of PMFs in vivo and identified seven brain-targeting components. Subsequently, network pharmacology and experimental validation were utilized to explore the potential mechanisms of PMFs. The results suggested that PMFs have potential therapeutic value for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like mice, with the inhibition of neuroinflammation likely being a key mechanism of their anti-AD effects. Notably, sinensetin, tangeretin, nobiletin, and 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone were identified as potent neuroinflammatory inhibitors. This research elucidated the chemical and therapeutic foundations of PMFs, indicating their potential as treatments or nutritional supplements for AD prevention and treatment. Moreover, the integrated triad approach of sequential metabolism, network pharmacology, and experimental validation may serve as a promising strategy for screening bioactive compounds in herbs or functional foods, as well as for elucidating their therapeutic mechanisms.",Molecules
40050677,Carbon ion stimulation therapy reverses iron deposits and microglia driven neuroinflammation and induces cognitive improvement in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Insoluble iron deposits often exist as iron oxide nanoparticles in protein aggregates, impaired ferritin, or activated microglia and have been implicated as major causes of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. However, no crucial evidence has been reported to support the therapeutic effects of current iron chelators on the deposition of various molecular forms of insoluble iron. We investigated the therapeutic effect of carbon ion stimulation (CIS) via a transmission beam on insoluble iron deposits, iron inclusion bodies, and the associated biological response in 5xFAD AD mouse brains. Compared with no treatment, CIS dose-dependently induced a 33-60% reduction in the amount of ferrous-containing iron species and associated inclusion bodies in the brains of AD mice. CIS induced considerable neuroinflammation downregulation and, conversely, anti-inflammatory upregulation, which was associated with improved memory and enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effective degradation of insoluble iron deposits in combination with pathogenic inclusion bodies promotes AD-modifying properties and offers a potential CIS treatment option for AD.",Sci Rep

40073596,Biological evaluation of a new highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe for hypochlorous acid and its imaging application in cell and zebrafish.,"Hypochlorous acid is one of the most widely distributed reactive oxygen species in vivo. It is usually used as a signal molecule to participate in various life activities such as immunity and metabolism, and plays a notable role in maintaining homeostasis. When hypochlorous acid level is abnormal in the body, it will lead to a variety of diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a bio-friendly fluorescent probe with fast sensitivity and specific accuracy. In this study, the innovative probe PRS owns good optical properties, sensitivity and selectivity, and the response mechanism that the generation of new bond enhanced the fluorescence intensity is studied. Biocompatibility of probe is systematically and innovatively evaluated by using cells and zebrafish models. Note that the biocompatibility valuation of probe results from cytotoxicity test, zebrafish behavioral test, hepatotoxicity test, cardiotoxicity test, nephrotoxicity test, blood vessel toxicity test, immunotoxicity test and neurotoxicity test, and experimental indicators like swimming duration, swimming distance, swimming speed, pericardial rub, fractional shortening, stroke volume, heart rate, SV-BA, shortening rate of the ventricular short axis, liver area, liver fluorescence intensity, total length of intersegmental vessels, number of vessels, and average vessel length show that the probe has good biocompatibility. Moreover, the detection performance of the probe shows that the probe can target hypochlorous acid in cell and zebrafish models. The probe is proved to be much essential for the monitoring of hypochlorous acid in vivo. Therefore, it has been proven that the meaningful detection of probe PRS for HOCl is promising in the living organism. Moreover, our innovative biocompatibility testing can be used to evaluate the biosafety of fluorescent probe as well.",Bioorg Chem
40081429,Functional dynamic network connectivity differentiates biological patterns in the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be conceptualized as a network-based syndrome. Network alterations are linked to the molecular hallmarks of AD, involving amyloid-beta and tau accumulation, and consecutively neurodegeneration. By combining molecular and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed whether different biological patterns of AD identified through a data-driven approach matched specific abnormalities in brain dynamic connectivity. We identified three main patient clusters. The first group displayed mild pathological alterations. The second cluster exhibited typical behavioral impairment alongside AD pathology. The third cluster demonstrated similar behavioral impairment but with a divergent tau (low) and neurodegeneration (high) profile. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed two connectivity patterns encompassing the default mode network and the occipito-temporal cortex, linked respectively with typical and atypical patterns. These results support the key association between macro-scale and molecular alterations. Dynamic connectivity markers can assist in identifying patients with AD-like clinical profiles but with different underlying pathologies.",Neurobiol Dis
40043118,The interplay between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on Alzheimer's disease risk in women.,"Menopause is a major biological transition that may influence women's late-life brain health. Earlier estrogen depletion-via earlier menopause-has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.",Sci Adv

This study explored the promising potential of the Kaempferia parviflora (KP) and its methoxyflavones (MFs) against the disease. We evaluated KP extract and its five MFs for antioxidant capacity, cholinesterase inhibition (AChE, and BChE), amyloid plaque (Aβ) reduction, neuroprotection, and memory improvement in a mouse model. HPLC quantified the five MFs in KP extract, with 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (F1) being the most abundant. 5,7,4'-Trimethoxyflavone (F3) and 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (F4) exhibited the strongest AChE and BChE inhibitory activities, respectively. MFs hindered Aβ1-42 aggregation and destabilized fibrils, with F3 showing the potent anti-aggregation and the strongest fibril destabilization. They also protected SH-SY5Y cells from Aβ1-42-induced damage. Notably, F3 combined anti-cholinesterase and anti-Aβ activities, suggesting its potential as a multi-target agent. KP extract ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice, suggesting its potential for cognitive improvement. These findings revealed that KP can be a promising candidate for herbal medicine development against AD. Its multi-target MFs offered a unique advantage by targeting multiple AD pathways. KP may have a great potential to modify the disease and overcome the challenge of drug development as cognitive enhancing herbal medicine.",PLoS One

Elaeocarpus angustifolius Blume, a plant traditionally used in India for neurological disorders, was investigated for its therapeutic potential in AD. E. angustifolius alkaloid-rich fraction (EAF) was analysed using LCMS and GCMS, identifying 66 phytochemicals. Compounds were evaluated using Schrodinger software against key AD targets obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB), including recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (PDB ID: 4EY7), β-secretase (PDB ID: 6C2I), TNF-α converting enzyme (PDB ID: 2FV5), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PDB ID: 1Q5K), and amyloid-β precursor protein (PDB ID: 1AAP).

40135660,Binding interaction of acetylcholinesterase with steroidal pregnanes: insight from machine learning and atomistic simulation.,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is a key strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. While pregnane-based compounds have been suggested as AChE inhibitors, their mechanism of action remains unclear. This study employed machine learning (ML) and molecular modeling to probe the molecular interaction of AChE with steroidal pregnanes. The ML models were trained and validated on AChE bioactivity datasets to predict pIC50 and pKi values of small-molecule compounds. Among the models tested, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated superior performance and was used to identify pregnanes with pIC50 ≥ 5 and pKi ≥ 7 as promising inhibitors. Molecular docking revealed strong molecular interactions between AChE and several pregnanes, particularly 21-[(3-Hydroxy-2-naphthyl)oxy]pregnane-2-one. This compound interacted with critical sub-sites within the AChE binding gorge, including the catalytic active site, peripheral anionic site, oxyanion hole, and anionic sub-site, through multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns indicated structural stability and conformational flexibility of representative AChE-pregnane complexes as indicated by the dynamic parameters and cluster patterns. The Molecular Mechanics with Generalized Born Surface Area free energy analysis confirmed strong binding affinities, while residual energy decomposition provided insights into key residue contributions. Additionally, the pregnanes demonstrated favorable blood-brain barrier permeability and other drug-like properties, suggesting their potential as neurotherapeutic agents. Given their predicted bioactivity, strong interactions with AChE, and drug-like properties, the identified pregnanes warrant further optimization and experimental evaluation for the development of safe and effective AChE inhibitors.",J Biomol Struct Dyn
40046438,Plasma exosomal miRNA expression and gut microbiota dysbiosis are associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The gut microbiota composition and the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) differ significantly from those with normal cognition function. The study aimed to initially explore the relationship between plasma exosomal microRNAs, gut microbiota, and cognitive impairment, providing insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of AD.
METHODS: The study enrolled 8 participants with AD and 8 participants with normal cognition. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was utilized to evaluate cognitive function. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma exosomes, while metagenomic sequencing was employed to detect differences in the abundance of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the associations among them were analyzed.
RESULTS: Four exosomal miRNAs and 14 microbiota taxa, which exhibited differential expression and abundance, respectively, in comparison between AD group and normal cognition group, were identified to be significantly associated with MMSE scores. Notably, the abundance of potential probiotics, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis and Roseburia inulinivorans, which was decreased in AD patients, exhibited positive correlations with specific exosomal miRNAs: Roseburia intestinalis correlated with miR-3120-3p and miR-6529-5p; Roseburia inulinivorans correlated with miR-3120-3p, miR-6529-5p and miR-124-3p; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii correlated with miR-3120-3p.
DISCUSSION: The study revealed a close association among gut microbiota, plasma exosomal miRNAs, and cognitive impairment in AD, and suggested that specific components of gut microbiota and exosomal miRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Front Neurosci
40004464,Genomic and Transcriptomic Approaches Advance the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), represent a growing societal challenge due to their irreversible progression and significant impact on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Despite advances in clinical and imaging-based diagnostics, these diseases are often detected at advanced stages, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Recent breakthroughs in genomic and transcriptomic technologies, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and CRISPR-based screens, have revolutionized the field, offering new avenues for early diagnosis and personalized prognosis. Genomic approaches have elucidated disease-specific genetic risk factors and molecular pathways, while transcriptomic studies have identified stage-specific biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and severity. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), and spatial transcriptomics are enabling the stratification of patients based on their risk profiles and prognostic trajectories. Advances in functional genomics have uncovered actionable targets, such as ATXN2 in ALS and TREM2 in AD, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies. Despite these achievements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into clinical practice due to disease heterogeneity and the complexity of neurodegenerative pathophysiology.

40149954,Enhancing Membrane Repair Using Recombinant MG53/TRIM72 (rhMG53) Reduces Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Models.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that involves neuronal cell death initiated by the breakdown of the plasma membrane. Amyloid beta (Aβ), a hallmark protein that contributes to AD pathogenesis, is known to interact directly with the plasma membrane and induce increased intracellular calcium levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death. Our recent studies revealed that elevated levels of Aβ<sub>42</sub> induce a plasma membrane repair defect in neurons that compromises this conserved cellular response that would normally repair the disruption. Here, we tested if recombinant MG53/TRIM72 protein (rhMG53), a therapeutic protein known to increase plasma membrane repair capacity, could enhance membrane repair in AD neurons. rhMG53 increased plasma membrane repair in ex vivo and in vitro tissue treated with Aβ<sub>42</sub> or cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients, normalizing intracellular calcium levels, ROS, and cell death in treated cells. This study demonstrates that increasing plasma membrane repair can rescue neural cells from the neurotoxic effects of Aβ, indicating that elevating plasma membrane repair could be a viable therapeutic approach to reduce neuronal death in AD.",Biomolecules
40046335,Plasma biomarkers for diagnosis and differentiation and their cognitive correlations in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Increasing evidence has shown the potential value of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic and differential values of emerging plasma biomarkers for different types of dementia in a Chinese population and to explore their cognitive correlations. One hundred twenty patients with dementia, including 51 Alzheimer's disease patients, 54 subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia (SIVD) patients and 15 frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients were recruited alongside 27 cognitively unimpaired (CU) control subjects. Global and domain-specific cognition was assessed in all participants by a battery of neuropsychological tests. Plasma amyloid-beta (Αβ)42, Aβ40 and total tau (in CU controls and Alzheimer's disease patients) and phosphorylated tau at threonine-181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) levels (in all participants) were measured using the single-molecule array platform. The levels of all biomarkers differed between Alzheimer's disease patients and CU controls, with P-tau181 and GFAP levels and the Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio best differentiating the two groups [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.966, 0.932 and 0.927, respectively]. P-tau181 and GFAP levels were greater in the Alzheimer's disease group than in the other two patient groups and showed the best performance in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease patients from SIVD (AUC = 0.922) and FTLD patients (AUC = 0.894), respectively. Moreover, compared with that in the CU group, the GFAP level was elevated in the SIVD group, and the NfL level was elevated in all patient groups. Compared with other single biomarkers, the plasma Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio correlated with broader cognitive domains, including global cognition [Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), r = 0.314, P = 0.027; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), r = 0.313, P = 0.043], memory (r = 0.339, P = 0.016), language (r = 0.333, P = 0.020), attention and information processing speed (r = 0.369, P = 0.008), executive function (r = 0.305, P = 0.031) and visuospatial function memory (r = 0.453, P = 0.001). P-tau181 was an optimal plasma biomarker for identifying Alzheimer's disease patients and differentiating Alzheimer's disease patients from SIVD and FTLD patients. Moreover, the GFAP level and the Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio showed potential diagnostic and progression monitoring value, respectively, for Alzheimer's disease patients.",Brain Commun

The TMA-93, a brief binding memory test, has proven useful for diagnosing early AD, and is supported by normative data that accounts for age and cognitive reserve.ObjectiveTo compare the sensitivity of different TMA-93 cutoffs in detecting AD pathology.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on a biobank sample of patients with confirmed AD pathology via amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The sensitivity of six TMA-93 cutoffs was evaluated: the 10th, 15th, and 20th percentiles based on traditional norming (TN) and regression-based norming (RBN). False negatives (FN) characteristics were also analyzed.ResultsA total of 270 AD-positive patients (96 by amyloid-PET, 174 by CSF biomarkers) were included, comprising 224 with mild cognitive impairment and 46 with mild dementia. The 15th percentile using RBN demonstrated substantial sensitivity (80.4%), higher than that of the 10th percentile, and also provided a more uniform distribution across normative groups compared to the TN approach. Higher global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) and, in patients over 70, lower cognitive reserve (Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire), were linked to a greater likelihood of FN results.ConclusionsThe 15th percentile cutoff based on RBN, accounting for age and cognitive reserve, improves sensitivity for detecting AD pathology, making it a valuable screening tool for memory complaints. Future normative data from biomarker-negative subjects may enhance the sensitivity of cognitive tests.",J Alzheimers Dis
40158458,Handwriting strokes as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease prediction: A novel machine learning approach.,"In recent years, machine learning-based handwriting analysis has emerged as a valuable tool for supporting the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and predicting its progression. Traditional approaches represent handwriting tasks using a single feature vector, where each feature is computed as the mean over elementary handwriting traits or strokes. We propose a novel approach that analyzes each stroke individually, preserving fine-grained movement information that is critical for detecting subtle handwriting changes that may indicate cognitive decline. We evaluated this method on 34 handwriting tasks collected from 174 participants, extracting dynamic and static features from both on-paper and in-air movements. Using a machine learning framework including classification strategies, feature selection techniques, and ensemble methods like ranking-based and stacking approaches, we were able to effectively model stroke-level variations. The ranking-based ensemble achieved the highest accuracy of 80.18% using all features while stacking performed best for in-air movements with 76.67% accuracy. Feature importance analysis through SHAP revealed that certain tasks, particularly sentence writing under dictation, were consistently more predictive. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our stroke-level analysis approach, which outperformed aggregated statistical methods on 24 out of 34 handwriting tasks, validating the diagnostic value of examining individual movement patterns.",Comput Biol Med
40079790,Comorbid cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative burden in mild behavioral impairment and their impact on clinical trajectory.,"AIM: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a neurobehavioral prodrome to dementia with multiple phenotypic characteristics. To investigate the complex neurobiological substrate underlying MBI, we evaluated its association with a composite magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measure of concomitant cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and neurodegeneration; and the interaction effects of MBI and MRI scores on cognitive and clinical trajectory.
METHODS: 253 dementia-free participants (mean age=71.9, follow-up period=49.89 months) from 2 memory clinics were included in this study. 37 (14.6%) participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for MBI, ascertained by repeated neuropsychiatric inventory assessments. MRI scores were computed using a validated weighted sum of white matter hyperintensities volume, presence of infarct, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness of known Alzheimer's disease-associated regions. Clinical and cognitive outcomes were evaluated annually using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB) and standardized global cognitive scores of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery respectively.
RESULTS: Lower MRI scores, indicating greater burden of comorbid CeVD and neurodegeneration, yielded a 3.8-fold likelihood of MBI compared to 1.5-fold with larger WMH volume or lower cortical thickness individually. Interaction analyses showed that MBI participants with low MRI scores had greater increase in CDR-SB (B=0.05, SE=0.01, p&lt;0.001) over time. All models involving the composite MRI measure yielded a better fit compared to reduced models with either pathology alone.
CONCLUSION: MBI is associated with a composite MRI measure that reflects mixed pathologies of dementia and their co-evaluation may improve risk profiling and identification of memory clinic patients without dementia who are at the highest risk of experiencing clinical decline.",Acta Neuropsychiatr
40128128,Unraveling Berberine's Molecular Mechanisms in Neuroprotection against Neurodegeneration.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) exhibit significant global public health challenges due to the lack of effective treatments. Berberine (BBR), a natural alkaloid compound in various plants, has been recognized for its potential neuroprotective properties. This review explores the current understanding of BBR's mechanisms of action and its therapeutic potential in preventing and treating NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. BBR's neuroprotective properties are attributed to its multifaceted actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and neurotrophic effects. Additionally, BBR can influence many signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration, including AMP-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathways. Furthermore, BBR targets vital signaling pathways, including AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK, essential for developing NDs. In addition, BBR's efficacy in reducing neurodegenerative pathology and improving cognitive function has been demonstrated through preclinical studies using cellular and animal models. Clinical trials demonstrating BBR's therapeutic potential in NDs have yielded promising results, but further research is needed to confirm its safety and efficacy in humans. BBR holds potential as a novel neuroprotective agent for preventing and treating NDs, providing a promising avenue for future therapeutic interventions.",Chem Biodivers
40045566,Dysregulated Neurotransmission and the Role of Viruses in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The causes of neurodegeneration remain elusive. There is growing evidence linking viral infection to dysregulated neurotransmission as a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease. Studies suggest that viral infection may result in dysregulated glutamatergic and l-arginine/NO neurotransmission that can initiate neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation within AD. This involves viral infection (HIV-1/HSV-1) altering glutamate biosynthesis and receptor activation resulting in excessive influxes of glutamate and subsequent dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that all contribute to reduced dendrite growth and tau phosphorylation. For l-arginine/NO neurotransmission, the mechanism derives from the ""protective"" antiviral mechanisms of NO that correlate with pathologies such as β-amyloid peptide accumulation and functional degeneration of hippocampal neurons, respectively. More research is required to underpin the direct mechanisms that viruses might impact to induce specific pathologies.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40145328,Decreased water exchange rate across the blood-brain barrier throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum: Evidence from Chinese data.,"INTRODUCTION: Water exchange rate (Kw) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to evaluate BBB functionality. Variations in BBB Kw across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum remain uncertain.
METHODS: The study encompassed 38 cognitively normal individuals without AD biomarkers (CN_A-), 30 cognitively normal (CN_A+), and 31 cognitively impaired individuals (CI_A+) with positive AD biomarkers. Participants underwent clinical assessments, MRI/positron emission tomography scans, and assays of plasma biomarkers.
RESULTS: Significantly lower Kw was observed in multiple brain regions throughout the AD continuum. This alteration in Kw correlated with plasma biomarkers and neuropsychological performance. Elevated levels of phosphorylated tau 217 intensified the inverse relationship between Kw and neuropsychological performance. The integration of Kw, brain volume, and plasma biomarkers demonstrated potential in distinguishing stages within the AD continuum.
DISCUSSION: Consistently lower Kw was evident across the AD continuum and may act as a diagnostic tool for early AD screening.
HIGHLIGHTS: Observations revealed a decline in water exchange rate (Kw) across multiple brain regions within the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, notably in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and deep brain nuclei during the preclinical stage of AD. Strong correlations were established between Kw levels in various brain regions and plasma biomarkers, as well as neuropsychological performance in the AD continuum. Interaction between plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and Kw in the hippocampus was linked to executive function, indicating a combined detrimental impact on cognitive abilities stemming from both blood-brain barrier Kw and p-tau 217. The combined use of Kw, brain volume, and plasma biomarkers-neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein-demonstrated potential for distinguishing individuals within the AD continuum.",Alzheimers Dement
40012188,Bioactive compounds and dietary patterns in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly, leading to severe cognitive decline and loss of autonomy. The accumulation of amyloid-β peptides and tau proteins in the brain is considered the central pathogenic mechanism, which results in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Various metabolic disruptions, such as chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory processes, further exacerbate the progression of AD. This review, based on literature from PubMed, SciELO, MDPI, and ScienceDirect, evaluates the role of bioactive compounds and dietary patterns, specifically the Mediterranean and MIND diets, in mitigating the progression of AD. These diets, rich in vitamins, flavonoids, carotenoids, and omega-3 fatty acids, have shown potential in reducing oxidative damage and inflammation in the brain, offering neuroprotective benefits. The findings suggest that bioactive compounds such as vitamin E isomers and polyphenols may delay cognitive decline, presenting a promising avenue for future dietary interventions aimed at optimizing the consumption of these compounds to prevent or slow the onset of AD. Further research is needed to determine the optimal doses and combinations of these bioactive compounds to maximize their protective effects.",J Alzheimers Dis
40056236,LncRNAs Orchestrating Neuroinflammation: A Comprehensive Review.,"CNS diseases account for a major part of the comorbidity and mortality of the human population; moreover, neuroinflammation has become an indication for different CNS diseases, for instance, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Microglia and astrocytes are the two main glial cells that can be found in the CNS. Each of these plays an important role in mediating immune responses like inflammation. There are many studies suggesting the role of LncRNAs in mediating neuroinflammation. Indeed, LncRNAs orchestrate neuroinflammation through various mechanisms, namely miRNA sponge, and transcriptional activation/inhibition. In addition, LncRNAs regulate different downstream pathways like NF-κB, and PI3K/AKT. In this study, we gathered the existing studies regarding the mechanisms of action of LncRNAs in the pathogenesis of different CNS diseases like neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injuries through regulating neuroinflammation. We aim to elaborate on the regulatory roles of LncRNAs in neuroinflammation and bring a more profound understanding of the etiology of CNS diseases in terms of neuroinflammation.",Cell Mol Neurobiol

However, the specific linkage between PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents and dementia is not well understood. We conducted a cohort of 217,336 participants of the UK Biobank to explore the association of long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia. We estimated PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents based on residential addresses by an evaluation model and used time-varying Cox models and Quantile g-computation models to assess the effects of individual constituents and their mixtures. Genetic susceptibility to dementia was assessed using a polygenic risk score, and its multiplicative and additive interactions with PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents were analyzed. Our results showed that black carbon (BC), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), organic matter (OM), and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) were positively associated with all-cause dementia, while BC and OM were linked to AD, with BC being the most influential. The combined effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents and genetic risk was stronger than their individual effect.

40016362,"Prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life years due to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in Middle East and North Africa, 1990-2021.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranks among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The objective was to evaluate the burden of AD and other dementias among the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by age and sex from 1990 to 2021. The data were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021. The estimates are presented as counts and age-standardised rates per 100,000 accompanied by 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2021, AD and other dementias recorded an age-standardised prevalence of 772.7 per 100,000 in the MENA region (95% UI 671.2-877.6 per 100,000). This rate decreased by 4.9% in comparison to 1990, marking a statistically significant change. AD and other dementias also accounted for approximately 73.79 thousand deaths in the region in 2021, with the age-standardised rate decreasing by 8.6% compared to 1990. Moreover, the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rate was 476.3 per 100,000 population (95% UI 225.6-1004.2), representing a 7.7% decrease from 1990 to 2021. Lebanon registered the highest point prevalence per 100,000 at 828.25, while the United Arab Emirates recorded the lowest at 652.43. The age-standardised point prevalence decreased from 1990 to 2021 in 13 of the MENA countries, while no significant changes were observed in eight of countries. Additionally, in 2021, women experienced higher prevalence rates, DALYs, compared to men. In the MENA region, age-standardised dementia prevalence rose with age in both sexes. The burden of dementia in MENA has decreased from 1990 to 2021, but it remains higher than global estimates. Furthermore, the findings indicate that dementia imposes a greater burden on the female population compared to males. To achieve a more accurate estimation of the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, more systematic studies in low- to middle-income countries within the MENA region are required.",Sci Rep
40055831,Antagonizing Il10 and Il4 signaling via intracerebral decoy receptor expression attenuates Aβ accumulation.,"Multiple lines of evidence indicate that immune signaling can impact the pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid deposition, tau aggregation, synaptic pathology and neurodegenerative trajectory. In earlier studies, we reported that intracerebral expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-10 (Il10) and Interleukin-4 (Il4), increased amyloid β (Aβ) burden in TgCRND8 mice, a preclinical model of AD-type amyloidosis. As both Interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R) and Interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) are upregulated in an age-progressive manner in rodent models of AD and in specific regions of human AD brains, we hypothesized that a decoy receptor strategy specifically targeting Il10 and Il4 signaling could have a disease-modifying effect. We derivatized the ectodomains of mouse Il10R (sIl10R) and mouse Il4R (sIl4R) into corresponding recombinant solubilized receptor forms and delivered these intracranially into neonatal TgCRND8 mice or hippocampally into adult TgCRND8 mice with pre-existing Aβ deposits. AAV-mediated expression of sIl10R and sIl4R robustly attenuated Aβ burden in TgCRND8 mice when expressed neonatally while in the hippocampus injection cohort, AAV-sIl4R, but not sIl10R, reduced Aβ burden. sIl10R and sIl4R had opposing effects on microglial and astrocyte proliferation, with sIl10R generally reducing gliosis. RNAseq analysis showed that sIl10R likely acts as a microglial immune checkpoint inhibitor while both sIl10R and sIl4R expression show unexpected impacts on genes related to circadian rhythm. Notably, neither Il10 nor sIl10R expression altered tau pathology in two tau transgenic models, despite robust expression and impacts on glial proliferation. Together, these data reveal that decoy receptor mediated targeting of physiological Il10 or Il4 signaling can beneficially impact amyloid deposition and thus represent novel immunomodulatory approaches for AD therapy.",Acta Neuropathol Commun
40141051,Age- and ApoE Genotype-Dependent Transcriptomic Responses to O<sub>3</sub> in the Hippocampus of Mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly, with late-onset AD (LOAD) accounting for 95% of the cases. The etiology underlying LOAD, however, remains unclear. Using a humanized mouse model, we showed previously that exposure to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), a potential environment risk factor, in a cyclic exposure protocol that mimics a human exposure scenario, accelerated AD-like neuropathophysiology in old humanized male ApoE3 (E3) but not ApoE4 (E4) mice. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques, we further demonstrate here that the ApoE genotype has the greatest influence on transcriptional changes, followed by age and O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Notably, AD-related genes were expressed even at baseline and in young mice, but the differences in the expression levels are obvious in old age. Importantly, although both E3 and E4 mice exhibited some AD-related transcriptomic alterations, old E3 mice exposed to O<sub>3</sub>, which showed memory impairment, experienced more pronounced disruptions in the expression of genes related to redox balance, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cellular senescence in the hippocampus, compared with O<sub>3</sub>-exposed old E4 mice. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying memory loss in O<sub>3</sub>-exposed old E3 male mice and emphasize the complexity of interactions between gene, environment, and aging in AD pathophysiology.",Int J Mol Sci
40099850,Interactive effects of post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion in older Vietnam-Era veterans with history of post-traumatic stress disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hypertension are highly prevalent among Veterans. Cognitive dispersion, indicating within-person variability across neuropsychological measures at one time point, is associated with increased risk of dementia. We examined interactive effects of PTSD symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion among older Veterans.
METHODS: We included 128 Vietnam-era Veterans from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (DoD-ADNI) with a history of PTSD. Regression models examined interactions between PTSD symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion (defined as the intraindividual standard deviation across eight cognitive measures) adjusting for demographics and comorbid vascular risk factors.
RESULTS: There was an interaction between PTSD symptom severity and hypertension on cognitive dispersion (p = .026) but not on mean cognitive performance (p = .543). Greater PTSD symptom severity was associated with higher cognitive dispersion among those with hypertension (p = .002), but not among those without hypertension (p = .531). Results remained similar after adjusting for mean cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest, among older Veterans with PTSD, those with both hypertension and more severe PTSD symptoms may be at greater risk for cognitive difficulties. Further, cognitive dispersion may be a useful marker of subtle cognitive difficulties. Future research should examine these associations longitudinally and in a diverse sample.",J Int Neuropsychol Soc
40034356,MRI-based mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease classification using an algorithm of combination of variational autoencoder and other machine learning classifiers.,"BACKGROUND: Correctly diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for patient selection in drug discovery. Research outcomes on stage diagnosis using neuroimages combined with cerebrospinal fluid and genetic biomarkers are expensive and time-consuming. Only structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scans from two internationally recognized datasets are employed as input as well as test and independent validation to determine the classification of dementia by the machine learning algorithm.
OBJECTIVE: We extract the reduced dimensional latent feature vector from the sMRI scans using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The objective is to classify AD, MCI, and control (CN) using MRI and without any other information.
METHODS: The extracted feature vectors from MRI scans by VAE are used as input conditions for different advanced machine-learning classifiers. Classification of AD/CN/MCI are conducted using the output of VAE from MRI images and different artificial intelligence/machine learning classifier models in two cohorts.
RESULTS: Using only MRI scans, the primary goal of the study is to test the ability to classify AD from CN and MCI cases. The current study achieved classification accuracies of AD versus CN 75.45% (F1-score = 79.52%), AD versus MCI 81.41% (F1-Score = 87.06%), and autopsy-confirmed AD versus MCI 92.75% (F1-Score = 95.52%) in test sets and AD versus CN 86.16% (F1-score = 92.03%) and AD versus MCI 70.03% (F1-Score = 82.1%) in validation data set.
CONCLUSIONS: By overcoming the data leakage problem, the autopsy-confirmed machine learning classification model is tested in two independent cohorts. External validation by an independent cohort improved the quality and novelty of the classification algorithm.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40131480,Vestibular dysfunction: a hidden risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: London taxi drivers' navigationally challenged hippocampi are known to be enlarged, and reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related mortality has recently been shown in similarly well-versed drivers, implying a neuroprotective effect through hippocampal engagement. Vestibular function has been linked to hippocampal size, suggesting that vestibular input may influence AD risk.
METHODS: Including 16 known modifiable lifestyle factors as covariates, we analyzed UK Biobank (UKB) volunteers aged over 55 years and without dementia at baseline to assess how peripheral vestibular dysfunction (PVD) influences the likelihood of an AD diagnosis.
RESULTS: 4684 AD and 2133 PVD cases were identified based on their ICD diagnoses; even accounting for other risk factors, PVD increased the risk of AD 1.7 times in UKB volunteers.
DISCUSSION: Vestibular loss, linked to hippocampal atrophy and default mode network disruption, appears to increase AD risk. Consequently, active vestibular stimulation by balance training or neuromodulation could offer potential for modifying AD progression.",J Neurol

These compounds were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities. Compound 7k, exhibited exceptional AChE inhibition (IC₅₀ = 0.083 μM), while compound 7d, showed potent activity (IC₅₀ = 0.119 μM). Kinetic studies revealed that 7k was able to exert its action through mixed types of inhibition. Also, the anti-inflammatory potential of these lead compounds was assessed in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Both compounds demonstrated significant dose-dependent inhibition of key inflammatory mediators, including NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β at non-cytotoxic concentrations (≤10 μM). Notably, compound 7k exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity, achieving 92 % NO inhibition, 65 % TNF-α reduction, and 61.1 % IL-1β suppression at 10 μM. Moreover, compound 7k exerted neuroprotective activity against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced neurotoxicity in SH-Sy5y cell line leading to reduction in LDH, ROS levels and improving cell survival. Finally, compound 7k was able to prevent Aβ aggregation at IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 μM. Molecular docking studies provided structural insights into the possible binding interactions of compounds 7d and 7k within the AChE active site. The stability and binding energies of compounds 7d and 7k complexed with AChE were assessed over 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations and compared with Donepezil. The MM/GBSA binding energy calculations indicated that compound 7k exhibited a higher affinity for AChE in comparison with compound 7d and Donepezil, with ΔG<sub>binding</sub> values of -46.1, -42.6, and - 24.0 kcal/mol, respectively.

39981365,Identification of blood plasma protein ratios for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls using machine learning.,"Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is essential for effective treatment and the development of therapies that modify disease progression. Developing sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tools is crucial for improving clinical outcomes and advancing our understanding of this condition. Liquid biopsy techniques, especially those involving plasma biomarkers, provide a promising noninvasive method for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. In this study, we analyzed the plasma proteomic profiles of 38 healthy individuals, with an average age of 66.5 years, and 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease, with an average age of 79.7 years. Proteins in the plasma were quantified using specialized panels designed for proteomic extension assays. Through computational analysis using a linear support vector machine algorithm, we identified 82 differentially expressed proteins between the two groups. From these, we calculated 6642 possible protein ratios and identified specific combinations of these ratios as significant features for distinguishing between individuals with Alzheimer's disease and healthy individuals. Notably, the protein ratios kynureninase to macrophage scavenger receptor type 1, Neurocan to protogenin, and interleukin-5 receptor alpha to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 1 achieving accuracy up to 98 % in differentiating between the two groups. This study underscores the potential of leveraging protein relationships, expressed as ratios, in advancing Alzheimer's disease diagnostics.

40051562,Ginseng and Polygonum multiflorum formula protects brain function in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment currently available. The Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. and Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. formula (GSPM) has shown potential neuroprotective effects, but its therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms in AD remain unclear and require further investigation.
METHODS: In this study, senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, an AD model, were treated with GSPM (low: 117 mg/kg, high: 234 mg/kg) or donepezil (1.3 mg/kg) via gavage for 2 months. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze. Hippocampal morphology was evaluated by H&amp;E staining, and neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were analyzed by Iba1 and GFAP immunohistochemistry. Levels of phosphorylated Tau, Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and senescence markers were measured. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. In vitro, the effects of GSPM were evaluated in Aβ1-42-stimulated HT22 hippocampal neurons. Cell viability was assessed via CCK-8, and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The AMPK/Sirt1 pathway was investigated by Western blotting, and SIRT1-dependent effects were evaluated following EX527 treatment, a SIRT1 inhibitor.
RESULTS: GSPM treatment improved cognitive function, reduced hippocampal tissue damage, and decreased neuronal apoptosis in AD mice. It alleviated neuroinflammation by reducing microgliosis and astrogliosis and lowered the levels of p-Tau protein and Aβ accumulation in both the hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, GSPM reversed the enhanced inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal senescence observed in AD mice. Furthermore, GSPM modulated gut microbiota composition by reducing microbial diversity and restoring the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio to levels similar to those in control mice. GSPM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus, which was negatively correlated with inflammation, Aβ1-42, p-Tau, and senescence markers. It also decreased the abundance of bacteria, such as Oscillibacter, Helicobacter, and Odoribacter, which are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal senescence. In line with in vivo findings, GSPM increased cell viability, reduced apoptosis, and alleviated oxidative stress in Aβ1-42-stimulated HT22 hippocampal neurons. It also decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced expression of senescence markers in vitro. Furthermore, GSPM restored AMPK phosphorylation and Sirt1 expression in neurons. Notably, inhibition of Sirt1 by EX527 reversed the neuroprotective effects of GSPM.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that GSPM exhibits protective effects on AD via suppressing the inflammation, oxidation, and senescence, possibly through regulating the Sirt1 signaling. These findings provided a novel therapeutic approach for AD.",Front Pharmacol

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between long-term and short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> (i.e., particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of, or smaller than, 2.5 μm or 10 μm), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide and the risks of AD and PD.
METHODS: A random-effects model was used to summarize individual effect estimates in the meta-analysis. A subgroup meta-analysis was further conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: In total, 42 eligible studies were included. For each 5 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.30; I<sup>2</sup> = 95%) and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.17; I<sup>2</sup> = 95%) for AD and PD, respectively.

40140189,Unveiling Gaps and Demographic Influences in Alzheimer's Therapy: A Data-Centric Study of FDA-Approved Late-Phase Clinical Trials.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is more prevalent in women than in men. In this study, the author examined the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed phase 4 clinical trials associated with Alzheimer's. The research aims to evaluate the women's participation-to-prevalence ratio (PPR) for Alzheimer's disease.
METHOD: Using the FDA's publicly available clinical trial database, 45 Phase 4 Alzheimer's trials from 2003 to 2019 were assessed. Further, the total PPR and yearly PPR value are calculated by dividing the percentage of women in clinical trials by the total percentage of women affected by Alzheimer's disease. The PPR value equal to 1 showcases the balanced participation of females in the Phase 4 clinical trial and the diseased affected population.
RESULT: Out of 45 trials, 41 were completed and four were terminated. The gender data was unavailable for three trials. In 38 clinical trials associated with Alzheimer's disease, 4502 participants were enrolled. Among 4502, 2604 (57.84%) were found to be female and 1898 (42.15%) were male. The PPR for women was 0.80, reflecting an adequate representation of women participants in late-phase clinical trials. The yearly PPR reduction has been seen in female participants.
CONCLUSION: In the year-based PPR, the range was from 0.72-1.0. In the initial year, the range was 1, which was reduced to 0.72 in 2007. In total, 38 completed clinical trials, 18 trials used placebo treatment, and the gender ratio in placebo was adequate.

40006634,Synthesis and Characterization of Memantine-Loaded Niosomes for Enhanced Alzheimer's Disease Targeting.,"Background/Objectives: Over the past 25 years, numerous biological molecules, like recombinant lysosomal enzymes, neurotrophins, receptors, and therapeutic antibodies, have been tested in clinical trials for neurological diseases. However, achieving significant success in clinical applications has remained elusive. A primary challenge has been the inability of these molecules to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recognizing this hurdle, our study aimed to utilize niosomes as delivery vehicles, leveraging the ""molecular Trojan horse"" technology, to enhance the transport of molecules across the BBB. Methods: Previously synthesized memantine derivatives (MP1-4) were encapsulated into niosomes for improved BBB permeability, hypothesizing that this approach could minimize peripheral drug toxicity while ensuring targeted brain delivery. Using the human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line differentiated into neuron-like structures with retinoic acid and then exposed to amyloid beta 1-42 peptide, we established an in vitro Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. In this model, the potential usability of MP1-4 was assessed through viability tests (MTT) and toxicological response analysis. The niosomes' particle size and morphological structures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with their loading and release capacities determined via UV spectroscopy. Crucially, the ability of the niosomes to cross the BBB and their potential anti-Alzheimer efficacy were analyzed in an in vitro transwell system with endothelial cells. Results: The niosomal formulations demonstrated effective drug encapsulation (encapsulation efficiency: 85.3% ± 2.7%), controlled release (72 h release: 38.5% ± 1.2%), and stable morphology (PDI: 0.22 ± 0.03, zeta potential: -31.4 ± 1.5 mV). Among the derivatives, MP1, MP2, and MP4 exhibited significant neuroprotective effects, enhancing cell viability by approximately 40% (p &lt; 0.05) in the presence of Aβ1-42 at a concentration of 47 µg/mL.

40134265,Assessment of instrumental activities of daily living in patients with cognitive impairment based on their ability to use household appliances.,"BackgroundDetecting life disability is crucial in diagnosing dementia; however, early detection has proven challenging with previous assessment scales. This study focused on an individual's ability to use household appliances as a means of detecting life disability.ObjectiveThe objectives of this study are threefold: (1) to compare the ability to use household appliances between the non-dementia and dementia groups, (2) to determine whether the level of life disability based on the ability to use appliances is at the level of diagnosed dementia or non-dementia, and (3) to explore the impact of age and gender on the ability to use appliances.MethodsWe selected 13 essential household appliances for elderly individuals and proposed an instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) assessment tool to evaluate their usage. Our sample consisted of 98 patients with cognitive impairment, divided into a non-dementia group (N = 34) and a dementia group (N = 64). Most participants in the dementia group had Alzheimer's disease or related conditions. Through multiple logistic regression, the model equation aimed to determine whether a subject's functional disability indicated a potential dementia diagnosis.ResultsThe optimal model equation identified the microwave oven and air conditioner as key factors, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. Additionally, analysis by age and gender enhanced the discriminative power of the results.ConclusionsOur proposed scoring system can efficiently determine the degree of life disability by assessing appliance usage, demonstrating comparable discriminatory ability to existing scales.",J Alzheimers Dis
40153577,"Interconnected Pathways of Alzheimer's Disease and Osteoporosis: A Review of Genetic, Hormonal, and Environmental Influences.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis (OP) are both age-related multifactorial degenerative diseases that share overlapping pathogenic mechanisms. While genetic factors contribute significantly to their onset and progression, environmental influences also play a crucial role. However, identifying the shared environmental factors and genetic architecture underlying the co-pathogenesis of AD and OP remains a significant challenge. This review highlights the common hormonal imbalances, environmental factors, genetic factors, and similar signaling pathways involved in both diseases. Furthermore, it explores the role of bone-secreted proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in AD, as well as the effects of brain-derived proteins and EVs on bone homeostasis. By shedding light on the interconnected molecular and pathological mechanisms of AD and OP, this review aims to enhance our understanding of the underlying pathological molecular mechanisms of AD and OP, promote early diagnosis, and support the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for AD and OP patients.",Aging Dis
39981405,A bibliometric analysis of research on dementia comorbid with depression from 2005 to 2024.,"INTRODUCTION: With the global rise in life expectancy, the incidence of dementia is increasing, often accompanied by depressive symptoms. Understanding the interplay between dementia and depression is crucial, as depression may not only co-occur with but also potentially exacerbate the progression of dementia. This study employs bibliometric analysis to map the global research landscape, identify prevailing themes, and discern future research directions.
METHODS: We analyzed reviews and original research articles on dementia and depression extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2005 to 2024. Utilizing tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and an R-based bibliometric analysis package, we assessed trends in publication volume, citation frequency, contributing countries, leading institutions, predominant journals, influential authors, and emergent keywords.
RESULTS: A total of 1972 publications were obtained, revealing a consistent increase in both the number of publications and their citation impact over the study period. The United States is the country with the most publications and the most extensive collaborations. The University of Toronto and the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease were identified as key contributors to this field. This research area is currently focused on cognitive impairments, the role of gut microbiota, and non-drug interventions. Future directions emphasize the importance of early detection and intervention, a deeper understanding of the gut-brain axis, and the integration of technology in treatment strategies. Additionally, there is a growing interest in the physiological and psychological interplays such as oxidative stress and its implications.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores pathogenesis, comorbid conditions, and non-drug interventions as primary research focal points, suggesting these areas as potential pathways for therapeutic innovation. These insights are intended to deepen our understanding, enhance diagnostics, and improve the management of dementia and depression, providing guidance for future research aimed at addressing these escalating global health challenges.",Front Neurosci
40047153,DNLA Delayed the Appearance of Learning and Memory Impairment of APP/PS1 Mice: Involvement of mTOR/TFEB/v-ATPase Signaling Pathway.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive impairment that currently is incurable. There is existing evidence to suggest that vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase) is one of the early key driving factors in the pathological process of AD. Thus, early intervention of v-ATPase may be a viable strategy.
AIMS: Observing whether early intervention with DNLA can delay learning and memory impairment in mice, and further exploring the mechanism of DNLA delaying AD in vitro based on v-ATPase.
METHODS: Four-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated with alkaloids from Dendrobium nobile Lindl (DNLA) 20 and 40 mg/kg/day for 5 months. The Morris water maze test and nest test showed that DNLA administration significantly delayed the appearance of cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. We further investigated the mechanism of DNLA promoting lysosome acidification in vitro by using PC12 cells.
RESULTS: We found that DNLA increases the degradation of β-amyloid (Aβ) contained in the autophagic lysosomes and alleviates the aging of neurons by promoting lysosome acidification and improving autophagy flow. In PC12 cells, DDB could promote the separation of mTOR and lysosome, promote the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), and then promote lysosome biogenesis and lysosome acidification by targeting ATP6V1A.
CONCLUSION: These results unraveled that preventive administration of DNLA may delay the impairment of learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice. The molecular mechanism may be related to promoting the mTOR-TFEB-v-ATPase pathway.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40002692,Beyond Amyloid and Tau: The Critical Role of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is traditionally viewed through the lens of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, implicating amyloid-beta and tau protein aggregates as the main pathological culprits. However, burgeoning research points to the brain's resident immune cells, microglia, as critical players in AD pathogenesis, progression, and potential therapeutic interventions. This review examines the dynamic roles of microglia within the intricate framework of AD. We detail the involvement of these immune cells in neuroinflammation, explaining how their activation and response fluctuations may influence the disease trajectory. We further elucidate the complex relationship between microglia and amyloid-beta pathology. This study highlights the dual nature of these cells, which contribute to both aggregation and clearance of the amyloid-beta protein. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the interplay between microglia and tau unveils the significant, yet often overlooked, impact of this interaction on neurodegeneration in AD. Shifting from the conventional therapeutic approaches, we assess the current AD treatments primarily targeting amyloid and tau and introduce novel strategies that involve manipulating microglial functions. These innovative methods herald a potential paradigm shift in the management of AD. Finally, we explore the burgeoning field of precision diagnosis and the pursuit of robust AD biomarkers. We underline how a more profound comprehension of microglial biology could enrich these essential areas, potentially paving the way for more accurate diagnostic tools and tailored treatment strategies. In conclusion, this review expands on the conventional perspective of AD pathology and treatment, drawing attention to the multifaceted roles of microglia. As we continue to enhance our understanding of these cells, microglial-focused therapeutic interventions emerge as a promising frontier to bolster our arsenal to fight against AD.",Biomedicines
40110649,Predicting amyloid beta accumulation in cognitively unimpaired older adults: Cognitive assessments provide no additional utility beyond demographic and genetic factors.,"BACKGROUND: Integrating non-invasive measures to estimate abnormal amyloid beta accumulation (Aβ+) is key to developing a screening tool for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The predictive capability of standard neuropsychological tests in estimating Aβ+ has not been quantified.
METHODS: We constructed machine learning models using six cognitive measurements alongside demographic and genetic risk factors to predict Aβ status. Data were drawn from three cohorts: Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Internal validation was conducted within A4 with external validations in ADNI and AIBL to assess model generalizability.
RESULTS: The highest area under the curve (AUC) for predicting Aβ+ was observed with demographic, genetic, and cognitive variables in A4 (median AUC = 0.745), but this was not significantly different from models without cognitive variables. External validation showed no improvement in ADNI and a slight decrease in AIBL.
DISCUSSION: Standard neuropsychological tests do not significantly enhance Aβ+ prediction in cognitively unimpaired adults beyond demographic and genetic information.
HIGHLIGHTS: Standard neuropsychological tests do not significantly improve the prediction of amyloid beta positivity (Aβ+) in cognitively unimpaired older adults beyond demographic and genetic information alone. Across three well-characterized cohorts, machine learning models incorporating cognitive measures failed to significantly improve Aβ+ prediction, indicating the limited relationship between cognitive performance on these tests and the risk of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings challenge assumptions about cognitive symptoms preceding Aβ+ screening and emphasize the need for developing more sensitive cognitive tests for early AD detection.",Alzheimers Dement
40007579,Control of cortical slow oscillations and epileptiform discharges with photoswitchable type 1 muscarinic ligands.,"Acetylcholine and the cholinergic system are crucial to brain function, including functions such as consciousness and cognition. Dysregulation of this system is implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. For this reason, cholinergic neuromodulation is relevant in both basic neuroscience and clinical neurology. In this study, we used photopharmacology to modulate neuronal activity using the novel selective type-1 muscarinic (M<sub>1</sub>) photoswitchable drugs: the agonist benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid-azo-iperoxo (BAI) and the antagonist cryptozepine-2. Our aim was to investigate the control over these cholinergic receptors using light and to investigate the effects of these drugs on physiological spontaneous slow waves and on epileptic activity in the cerebral cortex. First, we used transfected HEK cell cultures and demonstrated BAI's preferential activation of M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) compared with M<sub>2</sub> mAChRs. Next, we found that white-light illumination of BAI increased the frequency of spontaneous slow-wave activity in brain cortical networks of both active slices and anesthetized mice, through M<sub>1</sub>-mAChRs activation. Illumination of cryptozepine-2 with UV light effectively suppressed not only the muscarinic-induced increase in slow-wave frequency, but also muscarinic-induced epileptiform discharges. These findings not only shed light on the role of M<sub>1</sub> acetylcholine receptors in the cortical network dynamics but also lay the groundwork for developing advanced light-based pharmacological therapies. Photopharmacology offers the potential for high-precision spatiotemporal control of brain networks with high pharmacological specificity in both healthy and pathological conditions.",PNAS Nexus
40101271,EEG biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: A novel automated pipeline for detecting and monitoring disease progression.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that profoundly alters brain function and organization. Currently, there is a lack of validated functional biomarkers to aid in diagnosing and classifying AD. Therefore, there is a pressing need for early, accurate, non-invasive, and accessible methods to detect and characterize disease progression. Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a minimally invasive technique to quantify functional changes in neural activity associated with AD. However, challenges such as poor signal-to-noise ratio-particularly for resting-state (rsEEG) recordings-and issues with standardization have hindered its broader application.ObjectiveTo conduct a pilot analysis of our custom automated preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline to identify indicators of AD and correlates of disease progression.MethodsWe analyzed data from 36 individuals with AD and 29 healthy participants recorded using a standard 19-channel EEG and features were processed using our custom end-t-end pipeline. Various features encompassing amplitude, power, connectivity, complexity, and microstates were extracted. Unsupervised machine learning (uniform manifold approximation and projection) and supervised learning (random forest classifiers with nested cross-validation) were used to characterize the dataset and identify differences between AD and healthy groups.ResultsOur pipeline successfully detected several new and previously established EEG-based measures indicative of AD status and progression, demonstrating strong external validity.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that this automated approach provides a promising initial framework for implementing EEG biomarkers in the AD patient population, paving the way for improved diagnostic and monitoring strategies.",J Alzheimers Dis
40031637,Self-Organized Prediction-Classification-Superposition of Longitudinal Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease: An Application to Novel Clinical Research Methodology.,"Progressive cognitive decline spanning across decades is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Various predictive models have been designed to realize its early onset and study the long-term trajectories of cognitive test scores across populations of interest. Research efforts have been geared towards superimposing patients' cognitive test scores with the long-term trajectory denoting gradual cognitive decline, while considering the heterogeneity of AD. Multiple trajectories representing cognitive assessment for the long-term have been developed based on various parameters, highlighting the importance of classifying several groups based on disease progression patterns. In this study, a novel method capable of self-organized prediction, classification, and the overlay of long-term cognitive trajectories based on short-term individual data was developed, based on statistical and differential equation modeling. Here, ""self-organized"" denotes a data-driven mechanism by which the prediction model adaptively configures its structure and parameters to classify individuals and estimate long-term trajectories. We validated the predictive accuracy of the proposed method on two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Japanese ADNI. We also presented two practical illustrations of the simultaneous evaluation of risk factor associated with both the onset and the longitudinal progression of AD, and an innovative randomized controlled trial design for AD that standardizes the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in a clinical trial. These resources would improve the power of statistical hypothesis testing and help evaluate the therapeutic effect. The application of predicting the trajectory of longitudinal disease progression goes beyond AD, and is especially relevant for progressive and neurodegenerative disorders.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
39994108,Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound enhances delivery of 30 nm Q10 for improving mental and memory disorder in APP/PS1 mice.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often experience mental and memory disorders with poor outcomes. Coenzyme Q10 can degrade formaldehyde (FA) and improve Alzheimer-related symptoms, but its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is limited. This study investigated whether low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) enhances 30 nm Q10 delivery and improve symptoms in AD model mice. Here, 30 nm Q10 was prepared by encapsulating Q10 in liposomes coupled with PEG, creating PEG-Q10@NPs under 30 nm in diameter. Wild-type mice and APPswe/PS1dE9 mice (a familial AD model) received 30 nm Q10 via intraperitoneal injection, or a combination of 30 nm Q10 and LIPUS (50 or 100 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Then the mice's anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors and biochemical index were evaluated. We found that the combination therapy of LIPUS at 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and 30 nm Q10 was more effective in ameliorating psychosis in AD mice than individual treatments with 30 nm Q10. This effectiveness was linked to higher levels of brain Q10, serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA), along with lower levels of FA and plaques. Especially, excessive FA directly inactivated 5-HT and DA in vitro. The enhanced cellular uptake of Q10 and improved BBB permeability facilitated by LIPUS were confirmed in both cultured cells and wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, LIPUS at the different intensity only partially alleviated anxiety and depression symptoms and memory deficits in AD mice. Hence, this combination therapy of LIPUS and 30 nm Q10 is an innovative strategy for ameliorating mental and cognitive disorders in AD.",Drug Deliv Transl Res
40114266,The role of n-3-derived specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in microglial mitochondrial respiration and inflammation resolution in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia globally and is characterised by reduced mitochondrial respiration and cortical deposition of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyper-phosphorylated tau. Despite its characterisation more than 110 years ago, the mechanisms by which AD develops are still unclear. Dysregulation of microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β may play a key role. Microglia are the major innate immune cell of the central nervous system and are critical responders to pro-inflammatory states. Typically, microglia react with a short-lived inflammatory response. However, a dysregulation in the resolution of this microglial response results in the chronic release of inflammatory mediators. This prolongs the state of neuroinflammation, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the microglial specialised pro-resolving mediator (SPM) contribution to phagocytosis of amyloid-β is dysregulated in AD. SPMs are derivatives of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and potentially represent a strategic target for protection against AD progression. However, there is little understanding of how mitochondrial respiration in microglia may be sustained long term by n-3-derived SPMs, and how this affects their clearance of amyloid-β. Here, we re-evaluate the current literature on SPMs in AD and propose that SPMs may improve phagocytosis of amyloid-β by microglia as a result of sustained mitochondrial respiration and allowing a pro-resolution response.",Mol Neurodegener
40001962,Periplaneta americana Extract Protects Glutamate-Induced Nerve Cell Damage by Inhibiting N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Activation.,"Neurocytotoxicity elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) is a substantial contributor to neurodegenerative diseases. Our current study expands on the previous findings in which Periplaneta americana (L.) extract (PAS840) was shown to protect PC12 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced injury. In this investigation, we performed LC-MS/MS and peptidomics analyses on the constituents of PAS840. Considering Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the primary focus, we utilized network pharmacology and molecular-docking techniques to predict PAS840's influence on AD targets. We established a glutamate (Glu)-induced PC12 cell injury model to conduct a comprehensive examination of PAS840's effects on pivotal cellular parameters, including intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cell apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels, and the expression of key proteins such as NMDAR1, cytochrome c (Cytc), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The results suggest that PAS840 manifests multi-target actions, robustly attenuating NMDAR activity. It efficaciously suppresses excessive NMDAR1 activation, restricts Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, alleviates oxidative stress, and mitigates inflammation, thereby ameliorating neuronal cell damage. Consequently, it establishes a solid scientific foundation for further exploration of PAS840's potential in addressing neurological diseases.",Biology (Basel)
40165355,Construction and Validation of the Modified Parietal Atrophy Index by Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease in a Memory Clinic.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is pivotal to the evaluation of cerebral atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although there are several scoring systems to identify atrophy in areas of interest, the possibility of having a simple and practical scale focused on evaluating parietal atrophy by MRI in a single axial slice in T2-Flair sequencing would be highly advantageous. We develop and validate the Mimenza-Aguilar-Herrera (MAH) visual scale to determine the degree of modified parietal atrophy by analyzing the posterior cingulate gyrus in an MRI axial slice in T2 weighted sequencing in individuals with early AD. Patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and other dementias were included. Interrater and intrarater concordance was analyzed with Cohen's kappa. ROC analysis was used to determine sensitivity/specificity. The relationship between medial parietal atrophy (MPA) and the MMSE and MoCA scores, age, educational level, and sex was determined by linear regression. Interrater concordance in the MPA-MAH was moderate, 0.83 (p = 0.001). The area under the curve in the mild AD group was 0.74, with a sensitivity of 71.67% and a specificity of 76.19% (p < 0.001). An association was detected between a MPA score > 1 [OR 5.1 (95% CI: 2-12.9, p < 0.001)], MMSE < 24 pts, [OR 4.5 (95% CI: 1.2-17.6, p = 0.026)], and MoCA < 24 pts, after adjusting for age and sex. The MAH scale proved useful in diagnosing early AD, with comparable performance to validated scales such as Koedam's and Scheltens'. This instrument could allow a quick and easy evaluation.",Eur J Neurosci
39980902,Whole Genome Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis in Alzheimer Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Investigation into different allelic variants may yield new associative genes to predict late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are important polymorphic components of the genome; however, they have been previously overlooked because of their complex genotyping. New software can now determine differing lengths of VNTRs; however, this has not been tested in a large case-control population.
METHODS: We used VNTRseek to genotype over 200,000 tandem repeats in 9,501 cases and controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. We first identified limiting factors of this analysis and then examined the association of VNTRs with AD diagnosis in a subset of non-Hispanic White participants.
RESULTS: We found that VNTRs were highly associated with areas of the genome with a high number of previously identified variants. From our case-control analysis, we identified 9 VNTRs with a repeat allele length associated with LOAD including VNTRs on DSC3, NR2E3, CCNY, PKP4, GRAP, and MAP6.
DISCUSSION: We were able to show the feasibility of this new type of analysis in large-scale whole-genome sequencing data and identify promising VNTRs that are associated with LOAD.",Neurol Genet
40050982,Biomarker identification for Alzheimer's disease through integration of comprehensive Mendelian randomization and proteomics data.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia with few effective therapies. We aimed to identify potential plasma biomarkers or drug targets for AD by investigating the causal association between plasma proteins and AD by integrating comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) and multi-omics data.
METHODS: Using two-sample MR, cis protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs) for 1,916 plasma proteins were used as an exposure to infer their causal effect on AD liability in individuals of European ancestry, with two large-scale AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets as the outcome for discovery and replication. Significant causal relationships were validated by sensitivity analyses, reverse MR analysis, and Bayesian colocalization analysis. Additionally, we investigated the causal associations at the transcriptional level with cis gene expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) data across brain tissues and blood in European ancestry populations, as well as causal plasma proteins in African ancestry populations.
RESULTS: In those of European ancestry, the genetically predicted levels of five plasma proteins (BLNK, CD2AP, GRN, PILRA, and PILRB) were causally associated with AD. Among these five proteins, GRN was protective against AD, while the rest were risk factors. Consistent causal effects were found in the brain for cis-eQTLs of GRN, BLNK, and CD2AP, while the same was true for PILRA in the blood. None of the plasma proteins were significantly associated with AD in persons of African ancestry.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive MR analyses with multi-omics data identified five plasma proteins that had causal effects on AD, highlighting potential biomarkers or drug targets for better diagnosis and treatment for AD.",J Transl Med
40002547,Cholinesterase Inhibitors from Plants and Their Potential in Alzheimer's Treatment: Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, primarily due to dysfunction of acetylcholine caused by acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. While synthetic cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are commonly used, they have notable side effects, prompting interest in natural alternatives. Medicinal plants, rich in bioactive compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids, have shown potential as cholinesterase inhibitors with additional antioxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the cholinesterase-inhibiting effects of various plant species and their compounds to identify new therapeutic candidates and reduce side effects.
METHOD: A PRISMA-compliant review was conducted, screening studies from multiple databases, with a final inclusion of 64 in vivo studies.
RESULTS: These studies highlighted plant extracts such as Ferula ammoniacum, Elaeagnus umbellata, Bacopa monnieri, and Centella asiatica, which improved memory, reduced oxidative stress, and provided neuroprotection. Some extracts also reduced amyloid plaques, enhanced neuronal integrity, and restored cholinesterase activity, indicating their potential as therapeutic agents for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

40110656,"Using remote, digital, multi-day testing to characterize long-term forgetting in cognitively unimpaired older adults.","INTRODUCTION: Accelerated long-term forgetting (LTF) might be an early marker of subtle memory changes in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We leveraged remote, multi-day digital testing to characterize LTF in older adults and investigated its association with initial learning and AD imaging biomarkers.
METHODS: One hundred four cognitively unimpaired older adults completed a face-name memory task for seven consecutive days and were asked to recognize face-name pairs 1 week later. LTF was computed as the number of correctly identified stimuli divided by a participant's maximum performance during learning.
RESULTS: Better learning was associated with less LTF (β = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.34-0.71, p < 0.001). Accelerated LTF was associated with cortical thinning in AD-signature regions (β = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13-0.52, p = 0.001), but associations with regional tau were more subtle.
DISCUSSION: Remote, multi-day testing may facilitate the assessment of LTF as an early cognitive marker of preclinical AD, but further replication is needed.
HIGHLIGHTS: Using digital, remote assessments, we evaluated long-term forgetting in cognitively unimpaired older adults. We found a potential association between long-term forgetting and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related regions. Assessing long-term forgetting may facilitate early detection of AD-related cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement

Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is a significant genetic risk factor for AD, yet its specific role at the presymptomatic stage is not fully understood. This study aimed to elucidate the cellular and molecular effects of APOE4 compared to APOE3 on AD progression during the presymptomatic stage.
METHODS: We generated 5xFAD AD mice carrying human APOE3 or APOE4 and their non-AD controls. Behavioral tests, immunostaining, quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics, Golgi staining, and Western blotting were conducted at 3 or 10 months of age, respectively. Cell culture experiments were performed to assess APOE4's direct impact on neuronal mitochondrial function.
RESULTS: APOE4 significantly increased β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and microglial activation compared to APOE3 in 5xFAD mice at the presymptomatic stage, without aggravating the blood-brain barrier disruption. Proteomic and biochemical analysis revealed strong molecular features of synaptic degeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with APOE4. Notably, APOE4 promoted mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy while inhibiting fission, leading to impaired neuronal energy supply and increased reactive oxygen species.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that APOE4 accelerates AD pathologies at the presymptomatic stage by exacerbating Aβ deposition, neuroinflammation, and synaptic degeneration. The study highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a critical mediator of APOE4-induced AD progression, providing potential targets for early intervention.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40037471,Role of acute exposure to environmental stressors in the gut-brain-periphery axis in the presence of cognitive resilience.,"Climate change-induced environmental stressors, including ambient particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and extreme heat stress (HS), pose serious health risks, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exacerbates cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, while HS increases mortality and worsens air pollution. Combined exposure may amplify these effects, especially in vulnerable populations at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In our experimental study using a mouse model of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), we explored the combined effects of extreme weather conditions, particularly exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and HS. Our research indicated that even short, repeated exposure to these environmental stressors disrupts brain energy metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory functions, which we found to be associated with altered hippocampal synaptic functions. Additionally, we find that key mechanisms associated with impaired intestinal permeability and gut dysbiosis are affected, supporting the hypothesis that exposure to climate change communication may also disrupt the gut-brain axis, as in part evidenced in our study by peripheral changes in immune and inflammatory signaling. Moreover, despite significant disruptions in metabolic and immune-inflammatory pathways, we observed no acceleration of cognitive decline in the young asymptomatic EOAD mice subjected to short, repeated exposure to extreme heat and environmental PM<sub>2.5</sub>. These findings highlight the potential role of climate change in promoting risk factors like neuroinflammation and gut-brain axis dysfunction due to gut microbiome dysbiosis in the onset and progression of AD, particularly in asymptomatic individuals at risk for developing the condition.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis

The p3 peptides have been mis-named 'non-amyloidogenic'. Here we show p3<sub>40/42</sub> peptides rapidly form amyloid fibrils, with kinetics dominated by secondary nucleation. Importantly, cross-seeding experiments, with full-length Aβ induces a strong nucleation between p3 and Aβ peptides. The cross-seeding interaction is highly specific, and occurs only when the C-terminal residues are matched. We have imaged membrane interactions with p3, and monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and cell viability with p3 peptide. Together this data suggests the N-terminal residues influence, but are not essential for, membrane disruption. Single particle analysis of TEM images indicates p3 peptides can form ring-like annular oligomers. Patch-clamp electrophysiology, shows p3<sub>42</sub> oligomers are capable of forming large ion-channels across cellular membranes. A role for p3 peptides in disease pathology should be considered as p3 peptides are cytotoxic and cross-seed Aβ fibril formation in vitro.",Nat Commun

Therefore, we investigated CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, and STUB1/CHIP in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Non-AD mild cognitive impairment (Non-AD MCI), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases.MethodsThe CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB/CHIP, and core AD biomarkers were determined by ELISA in AD (n = 90), Non-AD MCI (n = 27), FTD (n = 15), and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (n = 20) subjects.ResultsHSP90AA1 levels were significantly higher in AD cases compared to the SCI subjects. The CSF levels of STUB1/CHIP were significantly lower in AD, Non-AD MCI and FTD cases compared to the SCI subjects. STUB1/CHIP levels of FTD cases were significantly lower than all other groups. HSPA4 levels was correlated with core AD biomarkers (Aβ 1-42, p-Tau, t-Tau) regardless of disease. Non-APOE ε4 carrier FTD cases also had significantly lower STUB1/CHIP levels than other groups.ConclusionsThe STUB1/CHIP holds promise as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between SCI subjects, AD, and FTD. Furthermore, APOE might serve as an additional discriminatory factor that might be integrated with this chaperone for enhanced discrimination.",J Alzheimers Dis
40151397,Combination therapy targeting Alzheimer's disease risk factors is associated with a significant delay in Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline can be a major contributor to loss of independent living. Therapeutic strategies that alter the course of cognitive deterioration have the potential to sustain activities of daily living, promote quality of life, and delay transition to nursing-home care.
METHODS: We performed longitudinal linear regression analysis of National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) cognitive data from 7653 mild dementia AD participants at baseline with at least one medication for diabetes (DBMD), lipid-lowering (LIPL), anti-hypertensive (AHTN), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSD) medications or any combination in 5684 (74%) participants and in 1969 (26%) participants with no study-relevant prescriptions over 10 years. Change in cognitive function was determined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores relative to non-treated participants stratified by sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Validation analysis was performed using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.
RESULTS: Combination of DBMD+LIPL+AHTN+NSD (QuadRx) resulted in a significant 46% MMSE and 32% CDR-SB delay in cognitive decline at 5 years, which was sustained at 10 years with a delay in decline of 47% MMSE and 33% CDR-SB. QuadRx was equally effective for the delay of cognitive decline in both females and males at 5 and 10 years. QuadRx mitigated the impact of the APOE ε4 genotype. Findings were validated in ADNI AD participants in which QuadRx was associated with a significant 60% MMSE delay in cognitive decline at 1 and 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was associated with a significant delay in cognitive decline in NACC AD participants at a magnitude comparable to or greater than amyloid beta immunomodulators. Further, the delay in decline was sustained for 10 years. The impact of QuadRx to delay cognitive decline was validated in deeply characterized ADNI participants. These data support combination therapy in persons with AD risk factors to alter the course of AD that persists for a decade, enabling cognitive function at a magnitude associated with independent living.
HIGHLIGHTS: QuadRx slowed Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline by 47% in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center NACC and 60% in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI participants.Combination therapy exhibited additive and synergistic slowing of cognitive decline.QuadRx was equally effective in females and males at 5 and 10 years.QuadRx mitigated the impact of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype.QuadRx was effective in AD participants reporting drug use for their AD risk factor.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40119776,Mini Review: Spatial Transcriptomics to Decode the Central Nervous System.,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS) by providing spatially resolved gene expression data. This mini review explores the impact of ST on CNS research, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We describe two foundational ST methods: sequencing-based and imaging-based. Key studies are reviewed highlighting the power of ST data sets to map transcriptomes to disease-specific histomorphology, elucidate molecular mechanisms of regional and cellular vulnerability, integrate single-cell data with tissue mapping, and reveal receptor-ligand interactions. Despite current challenges like data interpretation and resolution limits, ST holds promise for identifying novel drug targets, evaluating their therapeutic potential, and bridging gaps between animal models and human studies to advance development of CNS-targeting compounds.",Toxicol Pathol
40039528,Counterfactual MRI Generation with Denoising Diffusion Models for Interpretable Alzheimer's Disease Effect Detection.,"Generative AI models have recently achieved mainstream attention with the advent of powerful approaches such as SORA, DALL-E and stable diffusion. The underlying breakthrough generative mechanism of denoising diffusion modeling can generate high quality synthetic images and can learn the underlying distribution of complex, high-dimensional data. In our paper, we train conditional latent diffusion models (LDM) and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to provide insight into Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects on the brain's anatomy at the individual level. We first created diffusion models that could generate synthetic MRIs, by training them on real 3D T1-weighted MRI scans, and conditioning the generative process on the clinical diagnosis as a context variable. We conducted experiments to overcome limitations in training dataset size, compute time and memory resources by testing different models, effects of pretraining, training duration. We tested the sampling quality of the disease-conditioned diffusion using metrics to assess realism and diversity of the generated synthetic MRIs. We also evaluated the ability of diffusion models to conditionally sample MRI brains using a 3D CNN-based disease classifier relative to real MRIs. In our experiments, the diffusion models generated synthetic data that helped to train an AD classifier (using only 500 real MRI scans) - and boosted its performance by over 3% when tested on real MRI scans. Further, we used classifier-free guidance to alter the conditioning of an encoded individual scan to its counterfactual (representing a healthy subject of the same age and sex) while preserving subject-specific image details. From this counterfactual image (where the same person appears healthy), a personalized disease map was generated to identify possible disease effects on the brain. Our approach efficiently generates realistic and diverse synthetic data, and may create interpretable AI-based maps for neuroscience research and clinical diagnostic applications.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
39989900,Natural bioactive compounds form herbal medicine in Alzheimer's disease: from the perspective of GSK-3β.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis, particularly in tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Natural bioactive compounds have a wide range of sources, and medicinally valuable active compound can be extracted from plants, animals, and microorganisms. Currently, studies have found that various natural bioactive compounds from plants have the potential to improve AD symptoms, such as resveratrol and berberine. Therefore, this review examines the potential of natural bioactive compounds to modulate GSK-3β activity and inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. We summarize the current understanding of alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids and other natural compounds, highlighting their mechanisms of action and preclinical efficacy.",Front Pharmacol
40151913,Semaglutide improves cognitive function and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by activating AMPK and inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) causes cognitive function disorder and has become the preeminent cause of dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, semaglutide, have shown positive effects on promoting the cognitive function. However, research about the mechanism of semaglutide as a therapeutic intervention in AD is sparse.ObjectiveThis study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of semaglutide in a transgenic mouse model of AD pathology and explored the detailed mechanism by semaglutide modulated neuroinflammatory processes.MethodsMale amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were treated with semaglutide or vehicle for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test was used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of semaglutide on recognition function. Pathology analysis was performed to detect the deposition of amyloid plaques. High-throughput sequencing analysis was applied to specify the mechanism. Microglia and astrocyte activation were assessed with immunofluorescent staining. Inflammation cytokine levels were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Related proteins and pathway were evaluated with western blot.ResultsSemaglutide treatment attenuated Aβ accumulation and enhanced cognitive function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Through transcriptomic profiling, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA, semaglutide was substantiated to inhibit the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, as well as to curtail the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, semaglutide robustly activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling cascade, thus reducing the Aβ deposition and dampening the inflammatory cascade.ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that semaglutide mitigated neuroinflammation and decelerated the advance of AD in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.",J Alzheimers Dis
40151903,Comparing patterns of impairment in social cognition between young-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundYoung-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) is defined as when the disease starts before 65 years old. Compared with late-onset AD (LOAD), the progression is faster and more aggressive. However, the impact on social cognition deficits may not follow the same clear pattern.ObjectiveThe present study aims to investigate the relationship between social cognition, global cognition, and other clinical variables in people with YOAD and LOAD and their caregivers.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional design, we included 48 people with YOAD and 118 with LOAD, and their caregivers. We assessed social cognition, global cognition, quality of life, dementia severity, mood, functionality, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden.ResultsThe YOAD group was more impaired in general cognition (p = 0.002, d = 0.06), had a worse quality of life (p = 0.036, d = 0.36), and presented more neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.044, d = 0.35). However, social cognition did not exhibit the same disease progression and showed no difference when compared with the reports of their caregivers or with individuals with LOAD. The multifactorial regression analyses showed that functionality was related to social cognition impairment in YOAD (p = 0.035), and LOAD (p = 0.001).ConclusionsOur study found that people diagnosed with YOAD showed more global cognitive impairment but maintained social and emotional functioning.",J Alzheimers Dis
40015369,Off-pathway oligomers of α-synuclein and Aβ inhibit secondary nucleation of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils.,"α-Synuclein (αSyn) is a key culprit in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), in which it forms not only insoluble aggregates called amyloid fibrils but also smaller, likely more detrimental species termed oligomers. This property is shared with other amyloidogenic proteins such as the Alzheimer's Disease-associated amyloid-β (Aβ). We previously found an intriguing interplay between off-pathway Aβ oligomers and Aβ fibrils, in which the oligomers interfere with fibril formation via inhibition of secondary nucleation by blocking secondary nucleation sites on the fibril surface. Here, using ThT aggregation kinetics and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we tested if the same interplay applies to αSyn fibrils. Both homotypic (i.e. αSyn) and heterotypic (i.e. Aβ) off-pathway oligomers inhibited αSyn aggregation in kinetic assays of secondary nucleation. Initially soluble, kinetically trapped Aβ oligomers co-precipitated with αSyn(1-108) fibrils. The resulting co-assemblies were imaged as clusters of curvilinear oligomers by AFM. The results indicate that off-pathway oligomers have a general tendency to bind amyloid fibril surfaces, also in the absence of sequence homology between fibril and oligomer. The interplay between off-pathway oligomers and amyloid fibrils adds another level of complexity to the homo- and hetero-assembly processes of amyloidogenic proteins.",J Mol Biol
40092207,Neuroprotection effect of bovine umbilical mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium on the rat model of Alzheimer's disease mediated by upregulation of BDNF and NGF and downregulation of TNF-α and IL-1β.,"BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are distinguished by impairment and depletion of nerve cells; one of the most common NDDs is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can appear in early onset or late onset. In recent years, the secretome or conditioned medium of mesenchymal stem cells has provided new hope for improving conditions and preventing AD. One of the secretomes is bovine umbilical mesenchymal stem cells-conditioned medium (BUMSC-CM), where BUMSC is predicted to promote neuronal proliferation potentially.
AIM: This study analyzes the therapeutic efficiency of conditioned medium or secretome produced from BUMSC-CM in treating neurodegeneration in animal models of AD.
METHODS: Five groups consisting of 12 male rats were assigned: untreated (Group A, n = 5), positive control group given normal saline 1 ml/100 g BW (Group B, n = 5), AD rats model followed by Donepezil treatment (Group C, n = 5), AD rats model with BUMSC-CM 0.2 ml/kg BW post-trimethyltin (TMT) induction (Group D, n = 5), and AD rats model with BUMSC-CM 0.5 ml/kg BW post-TMT induction (Group E, n = 5). The brain samples were analyzed for neuronal density using cresyl violet staining. The expression and activity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed by ELISA; in addition, interleukin 1beta (IL-1β), tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-α), and neural growth factor (NGF) were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Interactions between the main substances of BUMSC-CM and beta-amyloid protein were visualized using in silico molecular docking.
RESULTS: Our result demonstrated that BUMSC-CM with the dosage of 0.5 ml/kg BW significantly increased BDNF concentration. We also found that BUMSC-CM with dosage 0.2 ml/kg BW and 0.5 ml/kg BW down-regulated IL-1β and TNF-α and upregulated NGF expression. Additionally, the number of neurons in AD rats post-treated with BUMSC-CM was significantly increasing. Furthermore, the amino acids in BUMSC-CM, including isoleucine, leucine, and valine, bind to the amyloid beta protein via interactions that are hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonded.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the neuroprotective potential of BUMSC-CM was demonstrated by its ability to upregulate BDNF and NGF while downregulating IL-1β and TNF-α. Additionally, BUMSC-CM showed potential to promote neuron proliferation in the hippocampus regions of a rat AD model. The main constituents in BUMSC-CM adhere to amyloid beta protein, hence diminishing the likelihood of ND disorders, specifically AD.",Open Vet J
40111935,Neuroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in cellular models of Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic brain degenerative disease that leads to dementia.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study is to investigate the neuroprotective impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) (empagliflozin and dapagliflozin) on tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.MethodsWe used MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, annexin-V-FITC kit, and DCFH-DA (dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate) to respectively evaluate the effect of the SGLT2i (empagliflozin and dapagliflozin) on amyloid-β (Aβ)<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neuronal death, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. The expression of NLRP3-inflammasome, phospho-Tau181, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CdK5), and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), was quantified by flow cytometry. Drug distribution in the mice's brains was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).ResultsAβ<sub>1-42</sub> significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, which was reversed by using gliflozins. SGLT2i significantly reduced Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced reactive oxygen species generation, downregulated NLRP3-inflammasome, and diminished tau pathology. Mechanistically, the last effect involved the modulation of GSK-3β and CdK5 protein expression. However, the tested treatments did not modify the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-stimulating effect of HDAC6. Gliflozins are substrates of drug transporters ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 and/or ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCB1 and ABCG2), and Elacridar significantly enhances their brain distribution.ConclusionsSGLT2i empagliflozin and dapagliflozin exhibited neuroprotective actions against human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neurotoxicity.",J Alzheimers Dis
40057157,L1CAM mimetic compound duloxetine improves cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice and protects Aβ1-42-damaged HT22 cells.,"BACKGROUND: Synapse loss and damage are underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease. Duloxetine has been identified as a mimetic of neural adhesion molecule L1CAM, a neuronal synapse component, suggesting duloxetine could be therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Cognitive function in 5xFAD mice was evaluated by open field, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. Hippocampal and cortical Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and amyloid plaque deposition were quantified by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. RT-qPCR and western blotting quantified the effects of duloxetine treatment on L1CAM levels and PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway activation. Apoptosis markers Bcl-2 and Bax were also measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting. HT22 cell survival was measured by CCK8 assay.
RESULTS: Duloxetine preserved learning and memory abilities, but had no effect on locomotor performance of 5xFAD mice. Duloxetine decreased Aβ1-42 expression levels, increased Aβ1-40 levels, reduced amyloid plaque formation, and activated the PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway in both cortices and hippocampi of 5xFAD mice. Moreover, duloxetine increased the expression of L1CAM and Bcl-2, and inhibited the expression of Bax, as well as prevented Aβ1-42 cytotoxicity in wild-type, but not L1CAM-knockdown HT22 cells, suggesting a feed-forward mechanism for duloxetine-mediated neuroprotection, whereby duloxetine induces and activates L1CAM to exert neuroprotective effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that duloxetine plays a neuroprotective role in 5xFAD mice and HT22 cells through activating L1CAM, likely by regulating the PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway. These results suggest that duloxetine may be a potential reagent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Eur J Pharmacol
40098995,Neuron-Astrocyte Interactions in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease: Dysregulation of Amyloid Precursor Protein.,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by its role in Aβ build-up and in neuronal and astrocytic malfunction. The major risk factor for late-onset AD is aging, which increases APP processing in both neurons and astrocytes, and consequently increases Aβ production. This focused review covers the subjects of how aging and AD affect APP dynamics within the both cell types and how astrocytes dysfunction can enhance neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction and injury. We discuss the interplay between neurons and astrocytes in aging and AD brains, where bi-directional cellular interactions accelerate neurodegeneration.",Ageing Longev
40122398,Mitophagy in Alzheimer's disease and other metabolic disorders: A focus on mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics.,"Mitochondria, as central regulators of cellular processes such as energy production, apoptosis, and metabolic homeostasis, are essential to cellular function and health. The maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, especially through mitophagy-the selective removal of impaired mitochondria-is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function, dynamics, and biogenesis is linked to neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is increasingly recognized as a metabolic disorder due to its shared pathophysiologic features: insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in pharmacological interventions, focusing on agents that modulate mitophagy, mitochondrial uncouplers that reduce oxidative phosphorylation, compounds that directly scavenge reactive oxygen species to alleviate oxidative stress, and molecules that ameliorate amyloid beta plaque accumulation and phosphorylated tau pathology. Additionally, we explore dietary and lifestyle interventions-MIND and ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, physical activity, hormone modulation, and stress management-that complement pharmacological approaches and support mitochondrial health. Our review underscores mitochondria's central role in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, particularly AD. By advocating for an integrated therapeutic model that combines pharmacological and lifestyle interventions, we propose a comprehensive approach aimed at mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and improving clinical outcomes in these complex, interrelated diseases.",Ageing Res Rev

40046779,Adolescent binge alcohol exposure accelerates Alzheimer's disease-associated basal forebrain neuropathology through proinflammatory HMGB1 signaling.,"Human studies suggest that heavy alcohol use may be an etiological factor contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Both alcohol use disorder (AUD) and AD share common underlying neuropathology, including proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-mediated neuroimmune signaling and basal forebrain cholinergic neuron degeneration. Adolescent onset of binge drinking represents a significant risk factor for later development of an AUD, and accumulating evidence suggests that adolescent initiation of heavy alcohol use induces HMGB1 signaling and causes degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system that persists into adulthood. However, it is unknown whether adolescent binge drinking confers increased risk for later development of AD-associated neuropathology through persistent induction of proinflammatory HMGB1 neuroimmune signaling. To investigate this question, we first (Experiment 1) assessed AD-associated neuropathology in the post-mortem human basal forebrain of individuals with AUD and an adolescent age of drinking onset relative to age-matched moderate drinking controls (CONs). In Experiment 2, we treated non-transgenic and 5xFAD male and female mice, which overexpress both mutant human APP and PS1, with adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5.0 g/kg, i.g. 2-days on/2-days off; postnatal day [P]30 - P55), and assessed AD-associated neuropathology in the adult (P100) basal forebrain. In Experiment 3, 5xFAD female mice received AIE treatment followed by glycyrrhizic acid (150 mg/L), an HMGB1 inhibitor, in drinking water from P56 to P100, and basal forebrain tissue was collected on P100 for assessment of AD-associated neuropathology. In the post-mortem human AUD basal forebrain (Experiment 1), we report upregulation of Hmgb1 and the HMGB1 receptors Rage and Tlr4 as well as microglial activation and increased intraneuronal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> accumulation in association with reduced cholinergic neuron marker expression (ChAT). In the 5xFAD mouse model (Experiment 2), AIE accelerated AD-associated induction of Hmgb1 proinflammatory neuroimmune genes, microglial activation, and reductions of ChAT+ basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the adult female, but not male, basal forebrain. In Experiment 3, post-AIE treatment with glycyrrhizic acid rescued the AIE-induced acceleration of AD-associated increases in proinflammatory HMGB1 neuroimmune signaling, microglial activation, and persistent reductions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in adult 5xFAD female mice. Together, these findings suggest that adolescent binge ethanol exposure may represent an underappreciated etiological factor contributing to onset of AD-associated neuropathology in adulthood through HMGB1- mediated neuroimmune signaling.",Front Aging Neurosci
40053120,Amyloid pathology related to aberrant structure-function coupling of brain networks in Alzheimer's disease: insights from [<sup>18</sup>F]-florbetapir PET imaging.,"PURPOSE: Brain structure-function coupling (SFC), which reflects the degree to which anatomical structure supports neural function, is an emerging imaging marker in neurodegenerative diseases. However, its pathological underpinnings in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the association among amyloid pathology, SFC disruption and cognitive decline.
METHODS: We included 173 participants from the SILCODE cohort, comprising cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) individuals. Amyloid pathology was quantified using [<sup>18</sup>F]-florbetapir PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). Structural connectivity (SC) was derived from diffusion-weighted MRI with probabilistic tractography, while functional connectivity (FC) was calculated from resting-state functional MRI. SFC was defined as the coefficient of determination from linear models predicting FC based on SC at regional level. Linear regression and mediation analyses were conducted to assess relationships between amyloid pathology, SFC, and multiple cognitive performances.
RESULTS: Compared to CU individuals, CI participants exhibited increased regional SFC primarily within the default mode network regions (p &lt; 0.05). In CI participants, amyloid pathology correlated with SFC across occipital lobe, precuneus and temporoparietal regions, which was specific by APOE ε4 status (p &lt; 0.05). Mediation analyses revealed that SFC partially mediated the relationship between amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment (ab<sub>MoCA-B</sub> = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.27, -0.02]). Similar findings were replicated with plasma markers.
CONCLUSION: Amyloid pathology may underlie SFC disruptions, contributing to cognitive decline in AD. These findings suggest that SFC may serve as a potential biomarker for amyloid-related neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.

40008882,Antibodies with specificity to glycan motifs that decorate OMV cargo proteins.,"UNLABELLED: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiological agent of periodontal disease, and infections with this bacterium are associated with systemic pathologies, including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. P. gingivalis has a variety of immune evasion mechanisms and exhibits highly variable cell surface characteristics that are strain dependent, complicating the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that a subset of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in antiserum raised against P. gingivalis strain W83 selectively recognize the outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Pre-adsorption with a mutant strain lacking an OMV-specific lipoprotein (PG1881) that has been shown to be glycosylated significantly enhanced IgM specificity toward PG1881 and the OMVs. In addition, the IgM reactivity against the OMVs derived from a mutant lacking enzymes required for O-glycosylation was markedly reduced, indicating that the IgM targets the glycan motifs on proteins carried on OMVs. Importantly, the IgM exhibited specific recognition of OMVs from both P. gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis, while showing low reactivity toward other genera belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This study revealed a potential host evasion strategy and highlights the potential for utilizing O-glycans in vaccine development and OMV-targeted antibodies in therapeutic interventions to combat P. gingivalis infections.
IMPORTANCE: O-glycosylation of cell surface proteins by bacteria is known to play a role in various functions including colonization and immune evasion. This study highlights the identification of IgM antibodies that specifically recognize O-glycosylated proteins that are selectively carried on outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The findings suggest a potential host evasion mechanism and open new avenues for using OMVs in vaccine development and targeting O-glycans with antibodies as a therapeutic strategy against the subgingival pathobiont P. gingivalis.",mSphere
40063856,Association of Plasma Biomarkers With Longitudinal Atrophy and Microvascular Burden on MRI Across Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD), neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are increasingly being used in clinical trials for diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. However, their association with longitudinal structural brain MRI changes, an important outcome measure across neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases, is less known. We investigated how baseline plasma biomarkers reflect MRI markers of progression over time in patients with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.
METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included patients from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI), Parkinson disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders (FTD), or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), followed annually for 2 years. Recruitment took place at specialized university-based dementia, movement disorders, and/or stroke clinics in the province of ON, Canada. MRI outcomes included markers of cerebral atrophy (ventricular CSF and regional gray matter volumes) and of small vessel disease pathology (white matter hyperintensity [WMH], perivascular spaces, and lacunar volumes). Hemorrhagic markers at baseline were also included. Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated tau181 and tau217 (p-tau181, p-tau217), and β-amyloid (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>) were quantified from blood samples collected at baseline using Simoa and used as predictors in linear mixed models adjusted for time (months), age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 carrier status, kidney function, vascular risk factors, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) diplotypes, waist-hip circumference ratio, and disease duration.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,240 MRIs from 473 patients (age: 69.2 ± 7.4 [range: 49-87]; 32.8% women). Elevated baseline levels of GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, and p-tau217, and to a lesser extent decreased levels of Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, were significantly associated with more cerebral atrophy and WMH burden at baseline (|B| = 0.02 to 1.69, p = 0.044 to &lt;0.001) and with progression over time (|B| = 0.001 to 0.028, p = 0.049 to &lt;0.001) in the pooled disease-agnostic group. Within disease-specific cohorts, GFAP and NfL were associated with cerebral atrophy and/or small vessel disease copathology in AD/MCI, PD, FTD, or CVD. P-tau181 and p-tau217 were associated with cerebral atrophy and/or small vessel disease copathology in AD/MCI, CVD, PD-MCI, or PD-dementia.
DISCUSSION: Selected plasma biomarkers seem useful as prognosis and monitoring tools of longitudinal imaging changes within real-world populations of neurodegenerative and/or cerebrovascular diseases, and provide insight into overlap across diseases in shared pathologic burden.",Neurology
40150525,Risk Factors for Poor Sleep Quality and Subjective Cognitive Decline in Older Adults Living in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety are associated with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and greater risk for developing cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted sleep habits and psychological well-being in many individuals, yet their relationship to SCD in this context remains understudied. We examined sociodemographic characteristics, depression, anxiety, and sleep changes during the pandemic (i.e., increased problems/poorer quality) and SCD in older individuals living in the US.
METHODS: In total, 288 older adults (M<sub>age</sub> = 67.4 [7.4]) completed an online survey including a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Revised) (CES-D-10; depression), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; anxiety), the Everyday Cognition scale (ECog; SCD), and a question about increased sleep problems/worsened sleep quality during the pandemic. Hierarchical and logistic regression analyses were used to assess relations among sociodemographic factors, depression, anxiety, changes in sleep quality, and SCD.
RESULTS: Self-reported pandemic-related impairments in sleep were associated with greater SCD (β = 0.16, p = 0.01). Depression (β = 0.46, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (β = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001) were also associated with greater SCD. Depression (OR = 1.17, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 1.15, p = 0.017) predicted reported poorer sleep during the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression, anxiety, and poorer sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with greater SCD concerns. Greater depression and anxiety were also associated with the reported sleep problems/worsened sleep quality.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations between two dietary patterns consistently linked to inflammation and brain health [the Mediterranean diet (MDS) and inflammatory potential of diet (EDII)] and five blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) in a sample of dementia-free community-dwelling older adults.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We used cross-sectional data from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K).
PARTICIPANTS: Participants who were institutionalized, had dementia or Parkinson's disease, or had missing data on diet and/or biomarkers were excluded. Our study sample consisted of 1907 adults ≥60 years old.
MEASUREMENTS: Adherence to the MDS and EDII was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. T-tau, p-tau181, Aβ 42/40, NfL, and GFAP were measured in serum. Associations were estimated through quantile regression models at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the biomarkers' levels, and were adjusted for potential confounders and stratified by sex, age, and APOE-e4 genotype.
RESULTS: In the whole sample, higher adherence to the MDS was associated with lower levels of p-tau181 at the 50th and 75th percentiles [β (95% CI) per 1-SD increment = -0.028 (-0.053, -0.002) and -0.036 (-0.072, -0.001), respectively], while higher adherence to the EDII was associated with higher levels of NfL at the 75th percentile [β (95% CI) per 1-SD increment =0.031 (0.008, 0.053)]. Associations with other biomarkers were only apparent at lower levels of their distribution. Subgroup analyses showed: 1) a stronger inverse association between the MDS and p-tau181 in APOE-e4 carriers than non-carriers, and 2) an inverse association of the MDS with GFAP only in participants ≥78 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet seems to be associated with biomarkers of AD pathology in cognitively intact older adults. Some associations were more apparent in the presence of genetic predisposition for AD or advanced age.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40095078,Biochemical characterization of Tau protein changes and amyloid dynamics in a novel non-transgenic rat model of tauopathy.,"In this study, we further characterized a non-transgenic model of tauopathy by examining tau protein changes using ELISA and Western blot upon inoculation of human tau oligomers (TO) and human tau synthetic pre-formed fibrils (TF) into the medial entorhinal cortex of Wistar rats. Our analyses showed that inoculation with TO did not significantly alter the ratio of phosphorylated tau at AT8 epitopes (pSer202/pThr205) to total tau protein in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but only resulted in a decrease of phosphorylation at AT100 epitopes (pThr212/pSer214). As we previously observed an increase in AT8 immunostaining in both regions, this suggests method-dependent conformational alterations. In contrast, eleven months after inoculation, TF caused significant AT8 and PHF-1 (pSer396/pSer404) epitope-specific changes in tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus, but not in the entorhinal cortex, reflecting a more advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like changes compared to TO. Importantly, amyloid plaques appeared as early as four months post-inoculation with TO, preceding significant phosphorylation changes of tau, thus indicating that amyloid probably facilitates early tau seeding and spreading. This was corroborated by the observed dynamic changes in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels in cerebrospinal fluid, with initial decreases followed by increases, similar to patterns seen in transgenic mouse models of AD and in AD patients. Altogether, these findings lead us to conclude that changes in tau protein induce amyloid changes and vice versa, which is actually what defines AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease.",J Neural Transm (Vienna)
40160278,Unleashing the potential: 40 Hz multisensory stimulation therapy for cognitive impairment.,"Cognitive impairment encompasses a spectrum of disorders marked by acquired deficits in cognitive function, potentially leading to diminished daily functioning and work capacity, often accompanied by psychiatric and behavioral disturbances. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) are significant causes of cognitive decline. With the global population getting older, AD and PSCI are becoming major health concerns, underscoring the critical necessity for successful treatment options. In recent years, various non-invasive biophysical stimulation techniques, including ultrasound, light, electric, and magnetic stimulation, have been developed for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. Preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of these techniques. This review discuss the impact of 40 Hz multisensory stimulation on cerebral function, behavioral outcomes, and disease progression in both animal models and individuals exhibiting cognitive deficits, such as AD and PSCI. Furthermore, it summarizes the potential neural pathways involved in this therapeutic modality by synthesizing evidence from a variety of studies within the field. Subsequently, it evaluates the existing constraints of this technique and underscores the potential advantages of 40 Hz multisensory stimulation therapy for individuals with cognitive deficits, with the goal of enhancing the management and care of AD and PSCI.",J Cent Nerv Syst Dis
40010154,A pilot study of senolytics to improve cognition and mobility in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: This single-arm study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of two senolytic agents, Dasatinib and Quercetin (DQ), in older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Participants took 100 mg of Dasatinib and 1250 mg of Quercetin for two days every two weeks over 12 weeks. Recruitment rate, adverse events, absolute changes in functional outcomes, and percent changes in biomarkers were calculated. Spearman correlations between functional and biomarker outcomes were performed.
FINDINGS: Approximately 10% of telephone-screened individuals completed the intervention (n = 12). There were no serious adverse events related to the intervention. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores non-significantly increased following DQ by 1.0 point (95% CI: -0.7, 2.7), but increased significantly by 2.0 points (95% CI: 0.1, 4.0) in those with lowest baseline MoCA scores. Mean percent change in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a key product of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), non-significantly decreased following DQ by -3.0% (95% CI: -13.0, 7.1). Changes in TNF-α were significantly and inversely correlated with changes in MoCA scores (r = -0.65, p = 0.02), such that reductions in TNF- α were correlated with increases in MoCA scores.
INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that intermittent DQ treatment is feasible and safe; data hint at potential functional benefits in older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease. The observed reduction in TNF-α and its correlation with increases in MoCA scores suggests that DQ may improve cognition by modulating the SASP. However, there was not an appropriate control group. Data are preliminary and must be interpreted cautiously.

40102403,Correlations of blood and brain NMR metabolomics with Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, impacting millions of geriatric patients globally. Unfortunately, AD can only be diagnosed post-mortem, through the analysis of autopsied brain tissue in human patients. This renders early detection and countering disease progression difficult. As AD progresses, the metabolomic profile of the brain and other organs can change. These alterations can be detected in peripheral systems (i.e., blood) such that biomarkers of the disease can be identified and monitored with minimal invasion. In this work, High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HRMAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to correlate biochemical changes in mouse brain tissues, from the cortex and hippocampus, with blood plasma. Ten micrograms of each brain tissue and ten microliters of blood plasma were obtained from 5XFAD Tg AD mice models (n = 15, 8 female, 7 male) and female C57/BL6 wild-type mice (n = 8). Spectral regions-of-interest (ROI, n = 51) were identified, and 121 potential metabolites were assigned using the Human Metabolome Database and tabulated according to their trends (increase/decrease, false discovery rate significance). This work identified several metabolites that impact glucose oxidation (lactic acid, pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate), allude to oxidative stress resulting in brain dysfunction (L-cysteine, galactitol, propionic acid), as well as those interacting with other neural pathways (taurine, dimethylamine). This work also suggests correlated metabolomic changes within blood plasma, proposing an avenue for biomarker detection, ideally leading to improved patient diagnosis and prognosis in the future.",Transl Psychiatry
40062420,Chiral Gold Nanostructure Monolayers as SERS Substrates for Ultrasensitive Detection of Enantiomer Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), requires the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers. Detecting chiral molecules at concentrations relevant to disease states remains challenging. Herein, a new type of chiral gold nanostructure induced by D-/L-cysteine-leucine dipeptides with a g-factor of 0.1 was successfully synthesized for enantiomer biomarker detection. To enhance the discrimination performance, the chiral gold nanostructures were assembled into D-/L-Au monolayers. As surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, the D-/L-Au monolayers simultaneously deliver molecular structural specificity and enantioselectivity within a single spectrum, which can be a versatile, label-free chiral discrimination strategy for the detection of D-/L-kynurenine (Kyn). The mechanism was unveiled to involve high enantioselective adsorption energies between L- and D-Kyn on the lattice plane (221), resulting in enantioselective sensing. The results showed that the L-Au monolayer reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.7 nm for L-Kyn, while the D-Au monolayer reached an LOD of 3.6 nM for D-Kyn. Notably, there was a significant difference in D-Kyn levels between AD patients and healthy individuals in serum samples, a distinction not observed for L-Kyn, which positioned D-Kyn as a potential novel biomarker for clinical prediagnosis of AD patients, marking the first report of its kind worldwide. This study provides a robust tool for advancing biomedical science and clinical diagnostics.",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl
40126600,Metformin Improves Spatial Memory and Reduces Seizure Severity in a Rat Model of Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease comorbidity via PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy. In our previous studies, we identified a partial AD-like phenotype associated with central insulin resistance in the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR), a genetic model of epilepsy. We also found that intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin, a compound used to model diabetes and AD, exacerbates seizure susceptibility. Given the role of insulin signaling in both AD and epilepsy, we hypothesized that metformin (MET), an anti-diabetic drug known for enhancing insulin sensitivity, could be a potential therapeutic agent for both conditions. Our objective was to investigate MET's effects on brain insulin signaling, seizure activity, and AD-like pathology in WARs. Adult male WARs received oral MET (250 mg/kg) for 21 days. Audiogenic seizures were assessed using the Categorized Severity Index and Racine's scale. Spatial memory was tested with the Morris water maze (MWM), followed by Western blot analysis of hippocampal proteins. MET significantly reduced seizure severity and improved MWM performance. Although MET did not affect insulin receptor levels or activation, it increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), activated Akt, and increased glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β (GSK-3α/β) levels. MET also decreased amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) levels but did not affect Tau phosphorylation. These results suggest that chronic MET treatment alleviates behaviors related to both AD and epilepsy in WARs and modulates insulin signaling independently of insulin receptor activation. Our findings highlight MET's potential as a therapeutic agent for managing comorbid AD and epilepsy, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action.",Mol Neurobiol
40091774,Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts.,"OBJECTIVE: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies.
METHODS: Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, APOE genotype, and cognition.
RESULTS: The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67-75, p = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, p < 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with lower CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD.
INTERPRETATION: Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol
40038760,The protective PLCγ2-P522R variant mitigates Alzheimer's disease-associated pathologies by enhancing beneficial microglial functions.,"BACKGROUND: Phospholipase C gamma 2, proline 522 to arginine (PLCγ2-P522R) is a protective variant that reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, it was shown to mitigate β-amyloid pathology in a 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Here, we investigated the protective functions of the PLCγ2-P522R variant in a less aggressive APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and assessed the underlying cellular mechanisms using mouse and human microglial models.
METHODS: The effects of the protective PLCγ2-P522R variant on microglial activation, AD-associated β-amyloid and neuronal pathologies, and behavioral changes were investigated in PLCγ2-P522R knock-in variant mice crossbred with APP/PS1 mice. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional studies were carried out using microglia isolated from mice carrying the PLCγ2-P522R variant. Finally, microglia-like cell models generated from human blood and skin biopsy samples of PLCγ2-P522R variant carriers were employed.
RESULTS: The PLCγ2-P522R variant decreased β-amyloid plaque count and coverage in female APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the PLCγ2-P522R variant promoted anxiety in these mice. The area of the microglia around β-amyloid plaques was also increased in mice carrying the PLCγ2-P522R variant, while β-amyloid plaque-associated neuronal dystrophy and the levels of certain cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1β, were reduced. These alterations were revealed through [18F]FEPPA PET imaging and behavioral studies, as well as various cytokine immunoassays, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, and immunohistochemical analyses using mouse brain tissues. In cultured mouse primary microglia, the PLCγ2-P522R variant reduced the size of lipid droplets. Furthermore, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that the PLCγ2-P522R variant regulated key targets and pathways involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and inflammatory/interferon signaling in acutely isolated adult mouse microglia and human monocyte-derived microglia-like cells. Finally, the PLCγ2-P522R variant also increased mitochondrial respiration in human iPSC-derived microglia.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the PLCγ2-P522R variant exerts protective effects against β-amyloid and neuronal pathologies by increasing microglial responsiveness to β-amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 mice. The changes observed in lipid/fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolism revealed by the omics and metabolic assessments of mouse and human microglial models suggest that the protective effects of the PLCγ2-P522R variant are potentially associated with increased metabolic capacity of microglia.",J Neuroinflammation
40098158,Perivascular space and white matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease: associations with disease progression and cognitive function.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent studies emphasize the role of vascular factors, including the glymphatic system, in AD pathogenesis, particularly in Aβ clearance. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS; ALPS-Index) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive method to evaluate the glymphatic system in vivo, showing glymphatic insufficiency in AD. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the function of the glymphatic system in individuals with AD versus healthy controls (HC), and to explore its association with Aβ, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cognitive function.
METHODS: DTI MRI data from three independent study cohorts (ActiGliA: AD n = 16, Controls n = 18; DELCODE: AD n = 54, Controls n = 67; ADNI: AD n = 43, Controls n = 49) were used to evaluate the perivascular space (PVS) integrity; a potential biomarker for glymphatic activity. The DTI-Along the Perivascular Space technique was used to measure water diffusion along PVS providing an index to assess the efficiency of the glymphatic system's waste clearance function. WMH load was quantified in FLAIR MRI using the lesion segmentation tool. We quantified WMHs volume within our defined region of interest (ROI) and excluded participants with any WMHs to avoid confounding the ALPS-Index. Associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD hallmark biomarkers, cognitive performance (MMSE) and clinical severity (CDR) were assessed.
RESULTS: AD patients had a significantly lower ALPS-Index vs. healthy controls (ActiGliA: AD: mean = 1.22, SD = 0.12; Controls: mean = 1.36, SD = 0.14, p = 0.004; DELCODE: AD: mean = 1.26, SD = 0.18; Controls: mean = 1.34, SD = 0.2, p = 0.035; ADNI: AD: mean = 1.08, SD = 0.24; Controls: mean = 1.19, SD = 0.13, p = 0.008). The ALPS-Index was associated with CSF Aβ concentration, WMH number and MMSE and CDR. WMH, found in the ROIs correlated negatively with the ALPS-Index.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of the DTI-ALPS-Index as a biomarker for glymphatic dysfunction in AD. It underscores the importance of considering vascular factors and the glymphatic system in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of AD as WMHs in the ROI could cause disturbances and inaccurate indices.",Alzheimers Res Ther
40090555,Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography does not improve EEG Alzheimer's disease assessment.,"Quantitative EEG has been shown to reflect neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may provide non-invasive and widely available biomarkers to enhance the objectivization of disease assessment. To address EEG's major drawback - its low spatial resolution - many studies have employed 3D source localization. However, none have investigated whether this complex mapping into 3D space actually adds value over standard surface derivation. In fact, we found no prior study - in any disease - that quantitatively compared the results of a 3D source localization method with those achieved by surface derivation. We analyzed data from one of the largest prospective AD EEG studies ever conducted (four study centers, 188 patients, 100 female). Thousands of distinct quantitative EEG markers of slowing, complexity, and functional connectivity were computed and regressed against disease severity, with rigorous control for multiple testing. We found highly significant associations between quantitative EEG markers and disease severity. However, standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), a widely used 3D source localization method, did not improve results. Furthermore, a surface derivation marker (auto-mutual information of the left hemisphere during the eyes-closed condition) was the best performing marker across our entire sample. While our findings strongly support that quantitative EEG markers reflect neurodegenerative processes in AD, they do not demonstrate additional benefit from sLORETA. Importantly, our results are specific to AD and sLORETA. Therefore, they should not be generalized to other neurological or psychiatric disorders or to other 3D source localization methods without further validation. Finally, these findings do not diminish the value of 3D source localization for visual EEG inspection.",Neuroimage
39987343,Insulin signaling disruption exacerbates memory impairment and seizure susceptibility in an epilepsy model with Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy exhibit a complex bidirectional relationship. Curiously, diabetes as a comorbidity increases the risk of epilepsy among AD patients. Recently, we reported that the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR) strain, a genetic model of epilepsy, displays a partial AD-like phenotype, including brain insulin resistance. We also assessed seizure susceptibility in an AD model created through intracerebroventricular injections of streptozotocin (icv-STZ), which induces AD features via brain insulin resistance. Our goal was to explore how disrupted brain insulin signaling influences AD-like features and seizure susceptibility in the WAR strain. Adult male WARs received a single intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (icv-STZ) (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline). Two weeks post-injection, spatial memory was assessed using the Barnes Maze (BM) test. Three weeks later, the rats underwent an audiogenic kindling (AuK) protocol (20 acoustic stimuli, 2 per day) to evaluate seizure frequency and severity. Seizures were analyzed using the Categorized Severity Index and Racine's scale and Western blot analysis was performed on hippocampal tissue. Our findings revealed that icv-STZ significantly worsened memory performance, increased seizure frequency, and reduced seizure onset relative to vehicle. Furthermore, icv-STZ decreased Akt activation and increased Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) phosphorylation, indicating disrupted insulin signaling. Notably, icv-STZ decreased tau phosphorylation without altering amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) levels. In conclusion, a low-dose icv-STZ injection exacerbates memory deficits and seizure susceptibility in the WAR strain by disturbing downstream proteins involved in insulin signaling. This highlights the implications of brain insulin resistance in both AD and epilepsy.",J Neural Transm (Vienna)
40054882,"Overexpression of the Apoe gene in the frontal cortex of mice causes sex-dependent changes in learning, attention, and anxiety-like behavior.","Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein that is important for lipid storage, transport, and metabolism. APOE gene variants are associated with Alzheimer's disease, as well as attentional function in healthy humans. Previous research has shown that Apoe transcription is increased following stimulation of the pathway between the locus coeruleus (LC) and frontal cortex (FC) in mice. This result suggests that Apoe may affect attentional function by virtue of its expression in circuits that control attention. Does Apoe causally regulate attention, or is its expression simply a byproduct of neuronal activity in the LC and FC? To answer this question, we synthetically induced Apoe transcription in the FC of male and female mice, and subsequently tested their ability to learn a touchscreen-based rodent version of the continuous performance test of sustained attention (the rCPT). We found that increased Apoe transcription impaired performance when attentional demand was increased in male mice, while in female mice, increased Apoe transcription significantly accelerated rCPT learning. We further found that this increase in Apoe transcription affected one metric of the open field test, as well as cellular activity in the FC in a sex-dependent manner. The results of this study provide insight into how Apoe causally regulates translationally relevant behaviors in rodent models.",Learn Mem
40139908,EnrichDO: a global weighted model for Disease Ontology enrichment analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Disease Ontology (DO) has been widely studied in biomedical research and clinical practice to describe the roles of genes. DO enrichment analysis is an effective means to discover associations between genes and diseases. Compared to hundreds of Gene Ontology (GO)-based enrichment analysis methods, however, DO-based methods are relatively scarce, and most current DO-based approaches are term-for-term and thus are unable to solve over-enrichment problems caused by the ""true-path"" rule.
RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel double-weighted model, EnrichDO, which leverages the latest annotations of the human genome with DO terms and integrates DO graph topology on a global scale. Compared to classic enrichment methods (mainly for GO) and existing DO-based enrichment tools, EnrichDO performs better in both GO and DO enrichment analysis cases. It can accurately identify more specific terms, without ignoring the truly associated parent terms, as shown in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) case (AD ranked first). Moreover, both a simulated test and a data perturbation test validate the accuracy and robustness of EnrichDO. Finally, EnrichDO is applied to other types of datasets to expand its application, including gene expression profile datasets, a host gene set of microorganisms, and hallmark gene sets. Based on the findings reported here, EnrichDO shows significant improvement via all experimental results.
CONCLUSIONS: EnrichDO provides an effective DO enrichment analysis model for gaining insight into the significance of a particular gene set in the context of disease. To increase the usability of EnrichDO, we have developed an R-based software package, which is freely available through Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EnrichDO.html) or at https://github.com/liangcheng-hrbmu/EnrichDO.",Gigascience

This provides important context for the dynamic control and dysregulation of PP2A function in disease states. Understanding the intricate regulation of PP2A signalling in disease has resulted in the development of novel pharmacological agents aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis.

39990094,Mechanisms of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and their roles in age-related neurodegenerative disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive breakdown of neuronal structure and function and the pathological accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and toxic protein oligomers. A major contributor to the deterioration of neuronal physiology is the disruption of protein catabolic pathways mediated by the proteasome, a large protease complex responsible for most cellular protein degradation. Previously, it was believed that proteolysis by the proteasome required tagging of protein targets with polyubiquitin chains, a pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Because of this, most research on proteasomal roles in neurodegeneration has historically focused on the UPS. However, additional ubiquitin-independent pathways and their importance in neurodegeneration are increasingly recognized. In this review, we discuss the range of ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathways, focusing on substrate identification and targeting, regulatory molecules and adaptors, proteasome activators and alternative caps, and diverse proteasome complexes including the 20S proteasome, the neuronal membrane proteasome, the immunoproteasome, extracellular proteasomes, and hybrid proteasomes. These pathways are further discussed in the context of aging, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, with a special focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. A mechanistic understanding of ubiquitin-independent proteasome function and regulation in neurodegeneration is critical for the development of therapies to treat these devastating conditions.

Statistical parametric mapping was performed to uncover similarities between the binding patterns of all four tracers. We found a continuous increase in Aβ-PET in APPSL70 mice from 5.3 to 11.0 months of age, resulting in a significantly higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FBB PET signal in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of APPSL70 mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice at 11.0 months of age. Parallel increases in SV2A-PET signals were observed in the cortex and thalamus of APPSL70 mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice. Statistical parametric mapping revealed a similar pattern of Aβ- and SV2A-PET differences (dice coefficient 53 %). Patterns of microglia activation showed stronger congruency with SV2A expression (dice coefficient 58 %) than patterns of reactive astrogliosis (dice coefficient 26 %). APPSL70 mice with limited neurodegeneration comprise a close temporal and spatial association between SV2A expression, Aβ plaque load, and microglial activation.

Nowadays, diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders is mainly based on neuroimaging and clinical symptoms, although postmortem neuropathologic confirmation remains the gold-standard diagnostic technique. In this sense, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome is considered a valuable molecular repository for diagnosing and targeting the neurodegenerative process. On the other hand, olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom that affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies' patients. That is why we consider that the application of tissue proteomics in primary olfactory structures is an ideal approach to explore early pathophysiological changes, detecting olfactory proteins that might be tested in CSF as potential biomarkers. In this chapter, we have applied peptide fractionation methods followed by tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS), in silico analysis and semi-quantitative orthogonal techniques in the olfactory tract derived from AD subjects. After obtaining the differential OT proteome, we suggest that the use of different bioinformatic workflows might be a valuable workflow to discover potential disease biomarkers for AD and other tauopathies.",Methods Mol Biol
40035979,Systemic Rejuvenating Interventions: Perspectives on Neuroinflammation and Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity.,"The aging process results in structural, functional, and immunological changes in the brain, which contribute to cognitive decline and increase vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke-related complications. Aging leads to cognitive changes and also affect executive functions. Additionally, it causes neurogenic and neurochemical alterations, such as a decline in dopamine and acetylcholine levels, which also impact cognitive performance. The chronic inflammation caused by aging contributes to the impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), contributing to the infiltration of immune cells and exacerbating neuronal damage. Therefore, rejuvenating therapies such as heterochronic parabiosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) administration, plasma, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and stem cell therapy have shown potential to reverse these changes, offering new perspectives in the treatment of age-related neurological diseases. This review focuses on highlighting the effects of rejuvenating interventions on neuroinflammation and the BBB.",Neurochem Res
39981356,Investigating the neuroprotective effects of Dracocephalum moldavica extract and its effect on metabolomic profile of rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive condition marked by multiple underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the investigation of natural products that can target multiple pathways presents a potential gate for the understanding and management of AD. This study aimed to assess the neuroprotective effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of Dracocephalum moldavica (DM) on cognitive impairment, biomarker changes, and putative metabolic pathways in a rat model of AD induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ). The DM extract was standardized and quantified based on examining total phenolic, total flavonoid, rosmarinic acid, and quercetin contents using colorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The antioxidant potential of the extract was evaluated by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and nitric oxide radical scavenging assays. Male Wistar rats were injected with STZ (3 mg/kg, single dose, bilateral ICV) to induce a sporadic AD (sAD) model. Following model induction, rats were orally administered with DM extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day) or donepezil (5 mg/kg/day) for 21 days. Cognitive function was assessed using the radial arm water maze behavioral test. The histopathological evaluations were conducted in the cortex and hippocampus regions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to assess metabolite changes in various brain regions. DM extract significantly attenuated cognitive dysfunction induced by ICV-STZ according to behavioral and histopathological investigations. Thirty-two discriminating metabolites related to the amino acid metabolism; the glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid/glutamine cycle; nucleotide metabolism; lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, ceramides, phosphatidylserines, and prostaglandins), and glucose metabolic pathways were identified in the brains of rats with sAD simultaneously for the first time in this model. Polyphenols in DM extract may contribute to the regulation of these pathways. After treatment with DM extract, 10 metabolites from the 32 identified ones were altered in the brain tissue of a rat model of sAD, most commonly at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of DM by upregulation/downregulation of various pathophysiological biomarkers such as adenine, glycerophosphoglycerol, inosine, prostaglandins, and sphingomyelin induced by ICV-STZ in sAD. These findings are consistent with cognitive behavioral results and histopathological outcomes.",Heliyon
40054398,Research on enhancing enzymatic degradation of anti-digestive peptides containing D-amino acids through N-terminal acetylation.,"The incorporation of D-amino acids can influence the structure and enzymatic stability of proteins or peptides, especially when they are introduced at enzyme cleavage sites, significantly inhibiting the enzymatic hydrolysis of peptides. The abnormal accumulation of these peptides has been linked to age-related conditions, including cataracts and Alzheimer's disease. N-terminal acetylation, an essential post-translational modification, significantly enhances the physicochemical properties of peptides and plays an essential role in regulating their performance within biological systems. This research examined the impact of N-terminal acetylation on the enzymatic hydrolysis of peptides incorporating D-amino acids. Enzymatic activity assessments showed that N-terminal acetylation greatly promoted the enzymatic breakdown of these peptides by Proteinase K (PROK), with the substrate decay rate constant for the acetylated peptide Ac-6-w increasing by 17.5 times. This enhancement was specific to serine-type proteases, which exhibited a comparable cleavage pattern. Molecular docking further demonstrated that N-terminal acetylation improved interactions within the catalytic triad of serine proteases, leading to faster enzymatic degradation. The results provide novel insights into the impact of N-terminal acetylation on the enzymatic behavior of peptides incorporating D-amino acids, and they propose a potential approach for targeting these peptides to preserve normal physiological functions.",Bioorg Chem
40144323,Disruption of Copper Redox Balance and Dysfunction under In Vivo and In Vitro Alzheimer's Disease Models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder disease mainly caused by extracellular senile plaques (SP) formed by β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) protein deposits. Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under Aβ exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under Aβ exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The Aβ induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that Aβ exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered detoxification by the lysosome. Our finding provided new insights in Aβ and AD induced Cu redox transformation and toxicity.",Environ Health (Wash)
40095881,Efficacy of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Photobiomodulation in Improving Cognitive Abilities for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Due to the increasing global prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and photobiomodulation (PBM) are considered potential complementary therapies. Objective: We assessed the efficacy and safety of tDCS and PBM and their potential to enhance cognitive functions in individuals with AD. Methods: This review primarily examined studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, followed by an assessment of the safety of tDCS and PBM for people with AD. The databases searched were PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection, resulting in 17 published randomized and controlled trials. References were screened over 5 years (2020-2024). The research design used PRISMA guidelines. Results: Fourteen studies were considered for tDCS, and the current literature supports efficacy and safety at an amperage of 2 mA, with electrodes placed on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Three studies were included for PBM. The heterogeneity of these study measures made them unsuitable for combined efficacy analysis, and they did not provide a safety evaluation. Conclusions: Despite differences in efficacy assessments, tDCS and PBM improved cognitive abilities. There is an urgent need to standardize metrics for evaluating efficacy and safety, particularly for PBM. Future research is encouraged.",J Clin Med
40164157,Mitochondrial Genome Variants and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a severe neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in people over the age of 60. The etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease are still unclear despite decades of active research. Numerous studies have shown that neurodegenerative processes in AD are associated with the mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, we briefly discuss the results of these studies and present the reported evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction in AD is associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations. The results of association analysis of mtDNA haplogroups and individual polymorphic variants, including those whose combinations define haplogroups, with AD are described in detail. These data clearly indicate the role of variations in the mitochondrial genome in the susceptibility to AD, although the problem of significance of individual mtDNA variants is far from being resolved.",Biochemistry (Mosc)
40107427,"A stilbenoid, rhapontigenin, isolated from the root of Rheum palmatum L. acts as a potent BACE1 inhibitor.","Seven compounds, comprising three anthraquinones and four stilbenoids, were isolated from the roots of Rheum palmatum L. These compounds include chrysophanol (1), aloe-emodin (2), aloe-emodin 8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), desoxyrhapontigenin (4), rhapontigenin (5), desoxyrhaponticin (6), and piceatannol 3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (7). Among these, compound 5 showed potent β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitory activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.256 ± 0.008 μM, making it the most effective inhibitor obtained from herbal extracts to date, followed by compounds 3 (1.164 ± 0.108 μM), 6 (1.213 ± 0.193 μM), 7 (1.270 ± 0.130 μM), and 4 (2.028 ± 0.108 μM). Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that compound 5 acted as a mixed type-I inhibitor with an inhibition constant K<sub>i</sub> value of 0.28 ± 0.07 μM. Notably, compound 2 exhibited potent Aβ aggregation inhibition with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.56 ± 0.19 μM, whereas compound 5 showed low Aβ aggregation inhibition with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &gt;40 μM. The docking simulations revealed that compound 5 had a high binding affinity and interacted with TYR132, predicting it as a key residue for inhibition via hydrophobic interaction, and with THR133 via hydrogen bonding, in the flap region of BACE1. These results suggest that stilbenoids generally exhibit higher BACE1 inhibitory activity than that of anthraquinones, and that compound 5 (rhapontigenin) could be a promising candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease as a potent BACE1 inhibitor.",Fitoterapia
40001529,Inositol Phosphates and Synthesizing Enzymes: Implications in Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Inositol is a vital sugar molecule involved in numerous signaling pathways required for cellular homeostasis and cell survival. Myo-inositol and its phospho-derivatives, inositol phosphates (IPs), are the most prevalent forms of inositol found in living cells. They are involved in regulating ion channels, metabolic flux, stress response, and other key biological processes. While emerging research has highlighted the significant roles of inositol phosphates in immunity, cancer, and metabolic diseases, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on their roles in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This review aims to fill that gap by analyzing the existing literature on the importance of inositol phosphates in severe psychiatric and neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, and Huntington's disease, underscoring the potential to pave the way for new treatment regimens for these debilitating disorders targeting inositol pathways.",Biomolecules
39976039,Beneficial and Detrimental Effects of Uric Acid on Alzheimer's Disease.,"The interconnection between brain function and hyperuricemia remains controversial since the available evidence indicates both the potent neuroprotective role of uric and its negative cardiovascular and metabolic effects, possible prooxidant activity. A mixed (protective and risk) effect of uric acid on neurological disorders was assumed. Among the neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease remains the most prevalent, causes disability, and lacks highly effective treatments. Therefore, this review aims to delineate the beneficial and detrimental effects of uric acid on Alzheimer's disease. This can not only facilitate estimating the benefits and risks of urate-lowering or urate-increasing interventions in different conditions but also can enhance understanding of the molecular pathways associated with the protective role of uric acid, leading to the identification of new therapeutic targets for neuroprotection. Firstly, we addressed interconnections between UA and AD in different patients and population subgroups. Secondly, we analysed which differences can arise at the level of uric acid transport to the brain, its influence on BBB, and its presence in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. Such aspects as xanthine oxidase interrelationship with the risk of cognitive impairment was elucidated, as well as the unexpected interconnection between uric acid exchange and the cholinergic system. Finally, an analysis was done of the beneficial and detrimental effects of uric acid on such targets of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis as the amyloid-β pathway, proinflammatory markers, peroxynitrite scavenging, and other aspects of prooxidant-antioxidant status.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40135149,Cardiovascular rate pressure product is associated with NfL in older adults at risk for AD.,"INTRODUCTION: Elevated cardiovascular rate pressure product (RPP) has been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality and is associated with poor cognitive test performance among older adults. However, it is unclear how RPP is related to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
METHODS: RPP was cross-sectionally evaluated as a predictor of CSF biomarker levels in a cohort of 310 cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease. The primary outcomes were CSF levels of α-Synuclein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light (NfL), soluble triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2, and total tau. Further analyses examined amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), and pTau181/Aβ4.
RESULTS: RPP was positively associated with NfL (β = 0.006, R <sup>2</sup> = 0.411, p = 0.012, but Bonferroni-corrected p ≤ 0.006) and not with other CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation investigated in this sample.
DISCUSSION: A high myocardial oxygen demand at rest may be related to neuronal death and axonal degeneration in cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the relationship between RPP and CSF analytes.Higher RPP was associated with higher NfL but not other measured CSF biomarkers.HR was positively associated with NfL, whereas SBP was not.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
40060035,Association between periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease: A narrative review.,"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that progressively damages the supporting structures of teeth, resulting in gum bleeding, inflammation, gum recession, and eventual tooth loss. Key factors, including poor oral hygiene, plaque accumulation, smoking, inadequate nutrition, and genetic predisposition, drive its development. Recent evidence underscores the potential role of periodontitis as a contributing factor to systemic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and brain inflammation. Emerging clinical and experimental studies indicate that these two conditions share overlapping risk factors and may be interconnected. One notable finding is the detection of specific periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), in the brains of individuals with AD. This suggests a possible link between chronic oral infections and neurodegeneration. These pathogens are believed to exacerbate neuroinflammatory processes by activating microglia and promoting systemic inflammation, which is central to AD pathogenesis. Further research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this association. Targeted interventions that address periodontitis, such as anti-inflammatory therapies or treatments targeting specific pathogens like P. gingivalis, could potentially mitigate its impact on the onset and progression of AD, offering a novel avenue for prevention and management strategies.",IBRO Neurosci Rep
40034515,"Single-session gamma sensory stimulation entrains real-time electroencephalography but does not enhance perception, attention, short-term memory, or long-term memory.","BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that gamma (40 Hz) audiovisual stimulation can enhance gamma oscillations and improve cognitive functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, despite promising long-term results, the efficacy of short-duration or single-session 40 Hz entrainment in humans has been questioned by behavioral studies that fail to find observable cognitive aftereffects, for two possible reasons: 1) lack of validated gamma entrainment, as most studies lacked concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) data to verify that gamma neural entrainment did take place, and 2) lack of diverse cognitive tests, as most studies did not test a wide range of cognitive factors.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to increase sensitivity for detecting single-session gamma entrainment. We employed 1) mid- and post-stimulation EEG monitoring to ensure entrainment worked, and 2) a comprehensive cognitive battery that probes perception, attention, working memory, and long-term memory.
METHODS: Participants received 30 min of synchronized 40 Hz light and sound stimulation, followed by a visual perceptual task, attentional network task, change detection working memory task, and long-term picture memory task, with concurrent EEG.
RESULTS: We observed robust 40 Hz EEG entrainment during stimulation but no significant 40 Hz oscillation after stimulation, and no significant cognitive improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite robust 40 Hz online entrainment, gamma sensory entrainment requires consistent long-term exposure to induce cognitive and neurological changes. Future research should determine the optimal duration and frequency of 40 Hz stimulation to maximize its therapeutic potential.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40151896,Abnormal epigenetic modification of lysosome and lipid regulating genes in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAbnormal lipid metabolism has been identified as a potential pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which might be epigenetically regulated. Lysosomes are critical organelles for lipid metabolism. However, the epigenetic modifications of lysosome and lipid regulating genes remain unclear in AD patients.ObjectiveExplore the role of abnormal epigenetic modifications, especially methylation of lysosome and lipid metabolism-related genes in AD.MethodsMethylation beadchip and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used to detect genome-wide DNA methylation levels and validate key gene methylation, respectively. Clinical data were collected from all participants. Associations between clinical biochemical characteristics and altered DNA methylation in AD patients were analyzed, and a risk factor model of AD was established.Results41 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) corresponding to 33 genes were identified in AD patients, with 18 hypermethylated and 23 hypomethylated positions. Significant alterations were observed in lipid regulating genes (CTNNB1, DGKQ, SLC27A1) and lysosomal transmembrane gene (TMEM175). Clinical analysis revealed that TP, ALB, IB, ADA, ALP, HCY, GLU, TC, BUN, HDL-C, LDL-C, and APOA1 levels were significantly higher in AD patients, whereas A/G and DB levels were lower. TMEM175 hypermethylation was further verified and found to correlate with TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, APOA1, IB, and HCY. The AUC of the AD risk model, which integrated clinical lipid markers and TMEM175 methylation, reached 0.9519 (p &lt; 0.0001).ConclusionsAbnormal epigenetic regulation of lysosomal gene and lipid dyshomeostasis were high-risk factors in AD. Methylation modifications of lysosome and lipid regulating genes might be key processes in AD pathogenesis.",J Alzheimers Dis
40118895,A cytometric bead array for the measurement of plasma biomarker levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Identifying plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered strong interest. In this study, a cytometric bead array (CBA) method for measuring the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) was evaluated. Fifty patients with cognitive impairment (CI) and 22 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls were recruited. CI patients were classified into Aβ + and Aβ - groups according to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan results. Biomarker levels in the plasma of all participants and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 28 CI patients were measured via CBA. Plasma P-tau181 levels were greatest in the Aβ + CI group and showed excellent performance in differentiating Aβ + CI patients from CU controls. The plasma and CSF levels of P-tau181 were correlated with each other and had similar diagnostic performance for distinguishing between Aβ + CI patients and Aβ- CI patients. Overall, CBA is a potential cost-effective method for measuring plasma biomarkers, particularly P-tau181, in AD patients.",Sci Rep
40009144,Dementia Medications and Their Association with Pain Medication Use in Medicare Beneficiaries with Alzheimer's Disease/Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias and Chronic Pain.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). Memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACHEI; donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are approved for the treatment of dementia symptoms and may also have analgesic properties. However, findings on the clinical utility of these dementia medications for chronic pain treatment are mixed, and little is known about differences in the use of pain medication according to whether an older adult with AD/ADRD is using dementia medications.
METHODS: We selected a 20% national sample of Medicare enrollees with a diagnosis of AD/ADRD and chronic pain in 2020. We calculated the odds of having any pain management prescription (opioids, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, gapapentinoids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), having an opioid prescription, and having a long-term (≥ 90 days) opioid prescription, by dementia medication (none, memantine, ACHEI, or memantine and ACHEI).
RESULTS: Among 103,564 patients, 5.5% received a memantine prescription, 14.4% received an ACHEI prescription, and 8.6% received a prescription for both. Over 70% of all patients had a pain management prescription. The percentage of patients who had an opioid prescription ranged from 54.5% for those without a dementia medication prescription to 44.0% for those with a prescription for both memantine and ACHEI. Similarly, the percentage of patients who had a long-term opioid prescription was highest for those without a dementia medication prescription (12.2%) and lowest for those with a prescription for both memantine and ACHEI (8.8%). Having a prescription for memantine only was associated with lower odds of any pain management prescription (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-1.00; p < 0.05). Having a prescription for either memantine (OR: 0.79; 95% CI 0.75-0.84), ACHEI (OR: 0.85; 95% CI 0.82-0.89), or both (OR: 0.75; 95% CI 0.72-0.79) was associated with lower odds of having an opioid prescription (p < 0.05). Lastly, having a prescription for either memantine (OR: 0.85; 95% CI 0.77-0.94), ACHEI (OR: 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.98), or both (OR: 0.83; 95% CI 0.77-0.90) was associated with lower odds of having a long-term opioid prescription.
DISCUSSION: Older adults with co-occurring AD/ADRD and chronic pain who were on dementia medications had lower odds of being prescribed opioid analgesics. Memantine and ACHEIs should be explored as potential opioid-sparing medications for older adults with AD/ADRD, given their relatively safe profiles. Future studies are needed to examine repurposing dementia medications for pain treatment.",Drugs Aging
40151915,APOE ε4 influences the dynamic functional connectivity variability and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundApolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is the most significant genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its impact on the dynamic changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC), particularly concerning network formation, interaction, and dissolution over time, remains largely unexplored in AD.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the effect of APOE ε4 on dynamic FC (dFC) variability and cognitive performance in AD.MethodsWe analyzed the dFC of AD patients, comparing APOE ε4 carriers (n = 33) with non-carriers (n = 41). The whole-brain dFC was assessed by calculating dynamic fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dfALFF) and dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo). To further explore the relationship between cognitive function and dFC in AD patients, we conducted a correlation analysis. Mediation analysis was also performed to determine whether dFC mediates the link between the APOE ε4 and cognitive decline in AD patients.ResultsAD patients carrying the APOE ε4 exhibited more severe cognitive impairment, along with reduced dReHo and dfALFF in both the left and right posterior cerebellar lobes. In these carriers, the dFC analysis showed lower dFC between the left posterior cerebellar lobe and the left middle temporal gyrus, which was positively correlated with executive function and information processing speed. Additionally, mediation analysis indicated that APOE ε4 influences dFC in this brain region, contributing to executive dysfunction in AD.ConclusionsThese findings offer preliminary evidence that APOE ε4 modulates fluctuating communication within the cerebellar lobe and the dFC between the cerebellar lobe and the temporal gyrus in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40042516,Calcineurin inhibition may prevent Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome.,"Virtually all people with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer disease pathology during their lifetime. As Alzheimer disease is the third leading cause of death and a significant factor in end-of-life complications for adults with Down syndrome, identifying interventions is a medical necessity. Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, has recently been investigated as a possible Alzheimer treatment. This review explores the histories behind Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease, and their intersecting pathologies. This is followed by the role that calcineurin and its U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological inhibitor, tacrolimus, may play in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease. Finally, this review discusses the gap in the literature surrounding the role of calcineurin, its regulators, and calcineurin inhibitors in the context of Down syndrome and comorbid Alzheimer disease. Future studies investigating the role that calcineurin plays in this pathology will be essential in determining the viability of calcineurin inhibitors to treat Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome. HIGHLIGHTS: Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, has become prominent as a possible therapeutic target to treat Alzheimer disease. People with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer pathology as they age, requiring novel therapeutics for treatment. People with Down syndrome may exhibit contraindications to calcineurin inhibition-based therapy, as they overexpress RCAN1 and DYRK1A, regulators of calcineurin. There is a significant gap in the literature involving the expression of calcineurin, RCAN1 and DYRK1A, in people with Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease, which must be addressed to determine the efficacy and safety of newly developed therapeutics.",Alzheimers Dement
39988989,Disclosure of elevated amyloid status is not associated with long-term suicidality in a preclinical AD trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The long-term implications of disclosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired individuals are unknown.
METHODS: We compared participants who disclosed their elevated amyloid imaging result in a preclinical AD trial to those who disclosed a not elevated result and enrolled in an observational cohort that underwent parallel assessments. Our primary outcome was a score > 0 on the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at any visit; we also considered suicidal behaviors (CSSRS > 5).
RESULTS: Among 1707 total participants (68% elevated amyloid, mean [standard deviation] age 71.5 [4.7], 60% female, 90% non-Hispanic White), followed for a mean 218 (74.1) weeks, there were no suicides and few indications of suicidal thoughts (n = 124 [7%]) or behaviors (n = 13 [<1%]). In a generalized estimating equation model controlling for covariates, we observed no effect of amyloid status on the primary outcome of CSSRS > 0 (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 0.76, 3.37).
DISCUSSION: With a structured approach, brain amyloid results can be returned safely.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study was among the first and largest studies to include biomarker disclosure in a population without cognitive impairment. Routine psychological assessment provided a novel assessment of the impact of disclosure in this sample. Learning an elevated brain amyloid result through a protocolized approach was not associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors compared to a matched cohort who learned they did not have elevated brain amyloid. Future research will be needed to ensure similar safety in more real-world settings.",Alzheimers Dement
39980737,Changes in neurotransmitter-related functional connectivity along the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Alzheimer's disease may be associated with early dopamine dysfunction. However, its effects on neurofunctional alterations in the neurotransmission pathways remain elusive. In this study, positron emission tomography atlases and functional MRI data for 86 older adults with mild cognitive impairment Alzheimer's disease (MCI), 58 with mild Alzheimer's disease-dementia and 76 cognitively unimpaired were combined to investigate connectivity alterations associated with the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. A cross-sectional design was used to compare neurotransmitter-related functional connectivity across groups and associations between functional connectivity and cognitive performance. The findings show that the Alzheimer's disease dementia group showed a decline in mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related connectivity in the precuneus but heightened connectivity in the thalamus, whereas the Alzheimer's disease-MCI group showed a decline in nigrostriatal connectivity in the left temporal areas. Acetylcholine-related connectivity decline was observed in both Alzheimer's disease-MCI and Alzheimer's disease-dementia primarily in the temporo-parietal areas. Episodic memory scores correlated positively with acetylcholine- and dopamine-related connectivity in the temporo-parietal cortex and negatively with dopamine-related functional connectivity in the fronto-thalamic areas. This study shows that connectivity alterations in acetylcholine and dopamine functional pathways parallel cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and might be a clinically relevant marker in early Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun
40091571,The management of mild neurocognitive disorder in primary care: A Delphi consensus study.,"BackgroundStrategies to identify and treat mild neurocognitive disorder (mild NCD) are still unclear.ObjectiveThe detection and management of mild NCD are crucial to prevent or delay its progression to major NCD, and to help those affected cope with cognitive impairment. The Cartesio Project aimed to reach a consensus on the management of mild NCD in primary care.MethodsThe Advisory Board of five experts (three neurologists, one geriatrician and one general practitioner (GP)), identified four domains of mild NCD: case finding; differential diagnosis; non-pharmacological, and pharmacological intervention. A literature review was performed by consulting the PubMed, PsycNET and Scopus databases from 2017 until August 2022, and guidelines, reviews and meta-analyses on mild NCD were reviewed. A care pathway involving 18 statements was then proposed and voted on by 61 participants (39% neurologists, 31% geriatricians, 25% GPs and 5% psychiatrists).ResultsAgreement was reached on 14 out of 18 statements. The practice of case finding in primary care and the need for a two-level diagnostic approach was supported, including referral to memory clinics. With regard to non-pharmacological treatments, no consensus was reached on nutritional supplementation. There was support for the use of nootropic drug treatments, but not for drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.ConclusionsThe Cartesio Project developed a consensus to identify the best care for mild NCD. The consensus highlights educational interventions on timely detection and appropriate management of mild NCD in primary care, which may be of relevance for those patients who eventually develop Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis

Also, various applications of Schiff-base functionalized nanoparticles and copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) such as therapeutic applications have been discovered. Thus, the current research highlights (i) the synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) produced with a Schiff base (SB) serving as a capping agent during their synthesis and (ii) assessment of the in vitro biological activities of Schiff base-synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles (SB-CuO-NPs) and a Schiff base (SB). Methods: SB-CuO-NPs were characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, zeta potential, DLS analysis, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). It also focuses on assessing the in vitro biological applications and activities, including antioxidant, scavenging, anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer, anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic activities, and enzymes inhibitory potential, of Schiff base-synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles (SB-CuO-NPs) and a Schiff base (SB) using methods described in the literature. Results: The results of the biological activities of the SB-CuO-NPs were compared with those of the SB. The SB-CuO-NPs demonstrated superior in vitro biological activities when compared to the SB from which they were produced. Conclusions: The results of this investigation concluded that the CuO-NPs, synthesized with the SB serving as an alternative capping agent, exhibited enhanced biological efficacy relative to the original SB. In the future, the biological efficiency of SB-CuO-NPs against diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer diseases will be assessed in experimental animals (in vivo).",Pharmaceutics
40017684,Mastication Influences Human Brain Anatomy.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this observational clinical study was to evaluate the relationship between brain anatomical and volumetric changes in white matter, grey matter, and cerebral cortex thickness with the number of functional occlusal pairs present in the mouth.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of functional occlusal pairs in 70 patients was counted and non-invasive brain analysis was performed using magnetic resonance imaging. The volume of grey matter, white matter, and thickness of the cortex in different areas of the brain were determined by SPM12 and CAT12 software. Multiple regression model corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR and Spearman correlation coefficient were calculated for statistical comparison.
RESULTS: A total of 70 (39 male, 31 female) were analysed, with an average number of occlusal pairs of 10.21 (3.99). According to the Spearman correlation coefficient, a lower number of occlusal pairs was related to a reduction in white matter (right external capsule and posterior limb of the internal capsule), a reduction in grey matter (right temporal superior and medial gyrus and left cerebellum crus 1) and a reduction in thickness of the cerebral cortex (rostral anterior cingulated cortex of the right hemisphere and areas in the right and left hemisphere, especially in the frontal cortex).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of occlusal pairs is related to the volume of white matter, grey matter, and thickness of the cerebral cortex in areas of the brain that are directly involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.",J Oral Maxillofac Res
40116743,Application of mini-mental state examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment in the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two types of dementia with a relatively high incidence, and their clinical manifestations are easily confused. However, the cognitive impairment characteristics of the two diseases are different, and the results of cognitive assessment can help the diagnosis of the disease.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the different characteristics of Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) in DLB and AD patients, and to explore potential markers to distinguish AD and DLB.
METHODS: This study included 66 patients with DLB, 81 with AD, and 58 cognitively normal subjects. All of them completed MMSE, MoCA, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).
RESULTS: Compared with NC, both DLB and AD participants demonstrated statistically lower scores in the total and subitem domains of MMSE and MoCA (p &lt; 0.05). When CDR was less than 2, DLB patients had better performance than AD in two subtests including memory and orientation (p &lt; 0.05), demonstrated worse performance in most subtest including executive function, writing, visuospatial abilities, and attention (p &lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, no notable distinction in scores existed for the DLB and AD groups with a CDR score of 2 (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We observed distinct cognitive performances in subjects from both the DLB and AD groups across different stages of dementia. Our study confirms the high value of MMSE and MoCA in distinguishing patients with DLB and AD in the early stages of the disease, and they can improve the differential diagnosis of DLB and AD.",Appl Neuropsychol Adult

40143145,"A New Era of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor Modulators in Neurological Diseases, Cancer and Drug Abuse.","The cholinergic pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in different cognitive functions of the brain, such as memory and learning. This review takes a dive into the pharmacological side of this important part of CNS function, taking into consideration muscarinic receptors and cholinesterase enzymes. Targeting a specific subtype of five primary muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5) through agonism or antagonism may benefit patients; thus, there is a great pharmaceutical research interest. Inhibition of AChE and BChE, orthosteric or allosteric, or partial agonism of M1 mAChR are correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms improvement. Agonism or antagonism on different muscarinic receptor subunits may lessen schizophrenia symptoms (especially positive allosteric modulation of M4 mAChR). Selective antagonism of M4 mAChR is a promising treatment for Parkinson's disease and dystonia, and the adverse effects are limited compared to inhibition of all five mAChR. Additionally, selective M5 antagonism plays a role in drug independence behavior. M3 mAChR overexpression is associated with malignancies, and M3R antagonists seem to have a therapeutic potential in cancer, while M1R and M2R inhibition leads to reduction of neoangiogenesis. Depending on the type of cancer, agonism of mAChR may promote cancer cell proliferation (as M3R agonism does) or protection against further tumor development (M1R agonism). Thus, there is an intense need to discover new potent compounds with specific action on muscarinic receptor subtypes. Chemical structures, chemical modification of function groups aiming at action enhancement, reduction of adverse effects, and optimization of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK) will be further discussed, as well as protein-ligand docking.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel)
40141075,"A Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibitor Improves Cerebrovascular Dysfunction, Neuroinflammation, Amyloid Burden, and Cognitive Impairments in the hAPP/PS1 TgF344-AD Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasing global healthcare crisis with few effective treatments. The accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyper-phosphorylated tau are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of AD. However, current studies have recognized a prominent role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD. We recently reported that SNPs in soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) are linked to AD in human genetic studies and that long-term administration of an sEH inhibitor attenuated cerebral vascular and cognitive dysfunction in a rat model of AD. However, the mechanisms linking changes in cerebral vascular function and neuroprotective actions of sEH inhibitors in AD remain to be determined. This study investigated the effects of administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-(1-Propanoylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]urea (TPPU), on neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction in an hAPP/PS1 TgF344-AD rat model of AD. We observed predominant β-amyloid accumulation in the brains of 9-10-month-old AD rats and that TPPU treatment for three months reduced amyloid burden. The functional hyperemic response to whisker stimulation was attenuated in AD rats, and TPPU normalized the response. The sEH inhibitor, TPPU, mitigated capillary rarefaction, BBB leakage, and activation of astrocytes and microglia in AD rats. TPPU increased the expression of pre- and post-synaptic proteins and reduced loss of hippocampal neurons and cognitive impairments in the AD rats, which was confirmed in a transcriptome and GO analysis. These results suggest that sEH inhibitors could be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.",Int J Mol Sci

This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective actions of DHEAS against Aβ toxicity in both cellular and animal models of AD. Methods: After optimizing the AD model in vitro, we investigated the DHEAS effects on the viability and death of primary mouse neurons exposed to toxic Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers for 24 h. In order to extend our research to an in vivo study, we further tested the acute effects of intraperitoneal DHEAS administration on the Aβ plaque density in different brain regions of 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD. Results: In cell culture, DHEAS hampered the decrease in the neuronal viability caused by toxic Aβ oligomers, primarily by influencing mitochondrial function and apoptosis. DHEAS also counteracted the increase in the mRNA expression of selected genes (PI3K, Akt, Bcl2, Bax), induced in neuronal culture by treatment with Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers. Obtained data suggested the involvement of mitochondria, caspases 3 and 7, as well as the PI3K/Akt and Bcl2 signaling network in the antiapoptotic properties of DHEAS in neurons. Forty-eight hours after DHEAS treatment, a significantly lower number of Aβ plaques was observed in the motor cortex but not in other brain areas of 3xTg-AD mice. Conclusions: Results indicated potential neuroprotective effects of DHEAS against Aβ toxicity and accumulation, suggesting that DHEAS supplementation should be further studied as a novel option for AD prevention and/or treatment.",Biomedicines

40116688,The effect of anti-seizure medications on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and AD-related symptoms: A scoping review.,"BackgroundAs the fastest-growing segment of the population, adults over 65 are at the most significant risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Older adults often use anti-seizure medications (ASMs), which can negatively impact cognitive function, mood, and behavior, mimicking AD or its symptoms. Understanding the effects of ASMs across diverse older adults is crucial, given that some ethnoracial groups are at higher risk for AD or more severe symptoms compared to non-Hispanic Whites.ObjectiveTo summarize the current evidence on the association of ASMs with AD risk and AD-related symptoms and explore the inclusion of ethnoracial minority groups in these studies.MethodsData sources included PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS for English-language studies published between 1990-2024. Selected studies were peer-reviewed, cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control, and clinical trials on AD dementia or related symptoms and ASMs. Study quality was rated by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Research Medicine.ResultsA total of 27 studies with 1,241,796 participants were included. Data on AD risk from level IB-IIIB evidence studies showed mixed results, with some indicating an increased association with ASM use [OR = 1.05-1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24]. Studies on AD-related symptoms from level IB-IV evidence also showed mixed results. Only three North American studies explicitly included race/ethnicity; most were conducted in European countries.ConclusionsASM use may be modestly associated with an increased risk of AD among the older adult population, but current data are inconclusive. The association of ASMs on AD-related symptoms varied. Future studies should emphasize reporting sociodemographic data and include diverse cohorts to enhance the applicability of findings.",J Alzheimers Dis
40135690,"Subjective daytime sleepiness, not sleep quality or hypoxia, predicts sleep-dependent memory consolidation in a cohort of older adults.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: Aging markedly increases the risk of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Memory deficits, an early indicator of AD, can be reduced in middle-aged OSA sufferers through treatment, with positive-airway pressure being the first line treatment standard. Here, we utilize natural variation in the OSA severity of an older-aged cohort to investigate whether hypoxia or sleep quality predict sleep-dependent memory consolidation (SDMC).
METHODS: Participants aged 65-85 years not currently receiving OSA treatment were recruited from the San Diego community via advertisement and referrals from other sleep studies. Participants undertook a computerized neurocognitive battery and overnight polysomnography. SDMC was measured using a word-pair associates task. Two linear regression analyses assessed associations between 1) SDMC and hypoxia metrics and 2) SDMC and sleep quality metrics.
RESULTS: The study included 67 participants (36 women, 31 men) most of whom presented with moderate or severe OSA. No significant associations were present in the hypoxia model. A negative association between Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score and SDMC was the only significant relationship in the sleep quality model. There was also a mild univariate correlation between ESS score and a second daytime function measure; the psychomotor vigilance task.
CONCLUSIONS: Objective measures of OSA pathology including hypoxia and sleep fragmentation were not associated with memory however ESS score, a subjective measure of daytime sleepiness, was associated with poorer memory task performance. This highlights the importance of considering subjective perceptions of sleep quality and daytime function in cognitive health outcomes of patients with OSA, particularly in older adults where they may integrate the myriad comorbidities that contribute to memory deficits in this group.

40143800,Monoaminergic Alterations at the Subregional Cervical and Thoracic Spinal Cord Level of Patients Within the FTD-ALS Continuum and Early-Onset AD: Low Thoracic Dopaminergic Activity in ALS.,"Early-onset neurodegeneration leads to cognitive and behavioral symptoms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor disturbances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite distinct clinical profiles, more than half of FTD patients experience ALS-related symptoms and vice versa. Spinal cord monoamine neurotransmitter alterations were reported in ALS, but not yet in FTD. Therefore, we compared monoaminergic turnover across the FTD-ALS continuum. Reversed-phase, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used to measure levels of the monoamines (nor)adrenaline ((N)A), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and their metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in five cervical and thoracic spinal cord regions in 10 FTD, 14 ALS, 6 mixed FTD-ALS, 14 early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), and 7 control (CONTR) individuals. At the cervical level, NA levels were lower in FTD-ALS versus CONTR, whereas the HVA/5-HIAA ratio was higher in ALS versus EOAD in the lateral funiculus. In the dorsal horn-intermediate gray matter, DA levels were decreased in FTD-ALS compared to FTD. At the thoracic level, DOPAC was lower in ALS than in FTD-ALS patients in the ventral and lateral funiculus, ventral horn, and dorsal horn-intermediate gray matter, as was the DOPAC/DA ratio in the lateral funiculus and dorsal horn-intermediate gray matter. Contrarily, HVA/DA turnover was lower in FTD-ALS than in FTD in the dorsal and ventral funiculus. We observed lower NA levels in FTD-ALS than in FTD in the ventral funiculus, and lower MHPG/NA turnover in the dorsal horn-intermediate gray matter. A levels were lower in ALS versus FTD. This study indicates differences in monoaminergic turnover across the FTD-ALS continuum, at the cervical and thoracic levels, with primarily a decrease in dopaminergic activity in ALS. Characterizing disease-specific neurochemical profiles for FTD, ALS, or FTD-ALS could contribute to the identification of novel interesting pharmacological targets.",J Neurochem

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress supplement that can improve inflammation and oxidative stress associated with ad. This study aimed to explore the protective potential of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). It also sought to uncover any synergistic effects when combined with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in treating Alzheimer's disease in rats, focusing on the modulation of the TLR-4/MAPK pathway and regulation of microRNA. The experiment involved seventy rats categorized into different groups: control, Reference group (donepezil 10 mg/kg/P.O.), CoQ10 alone (1,200 mg/kg/P.O.), ad-model (D-galactose (120 mg/kg/i.p) + Alcl<sub>3</sub> (50 mg/kg/P.O.)), donepezil co-treatment, CoQ10 co-treatment, and CoQ10 + donepezil co-treatment. Behavioral parameter was defined using the Morris-Maze test (MMT) and various assessments, such as GABA, oxidative stress, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, ion homeostasis, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), micro-RNA (mir-106b, mir-107, and mir-9) were measured. Immunohistological staining was used to assess structural abnormalities in hippocampus. CoQ10 treatment demonstrated memory improvement, enhanced locomotion, and increased neuronal differentiation, mainly through the activation of the TLR-4/MAPK pathway and regulation of mir-106b, mir-107, and mir-9.
HIGHLIGHTS: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) improved the rats' passive avoidance memory impairment caused by D-gal and AlCl<sub>3</sub>. ad led to the alteration of the TLR-4/MAPK pathways.CoQ10 as a protective agent, diminishes oxidative burden, improve ion homeostasis.CoQ10 counteracts Alzheimer's disease by enhancing neurotransmitter parameter and regulating the MicroRNA.CoQ10 lowered accumulation of Aβ plaque in the hippocampal neurons of D-Gal and AlCl<sub>3</sub>-treated rats.One promising therapeutic method was the combination of donepezil and CoQ10 therapy.",Toxicol Res (Camb)
40140603,Proteostasis and lysosomal repair deficits in transdifferentiated neurons of Alzheimer's disease.,"Ageing is the most prominent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the cellular mechanisms linking neuronal proteostasis decline to the characteristic aberrant protein deposits in the brains of patients with AD remain elusive. Here we develop transdifferentiated neurons (tNeurons) from human dermal fibroblasts as a neuronal model that retains ageing hallmarks and exhibits AD-linked vulnerabilities. Remarkably, AD tNeurons accumulate proteotoxic deposits, including phospho-tau and amyloid β, resembling those in APP mouse brains and the brains of patients with AD. Quantitative tNeuron proteomics identify ageing- and AD-linked deficits in proteostasis and organelle homeostasis, most notably in endosome-lysosomal components. Lysosomal deficits in aged tNeurons, including constitutive lysosomal damage and ESCRT-mediated lysosomal repair defects, are exacerbated in AD tNeurons and linked to inflammatory cytokine secretion and cell death. Providing support for the centrality of lysosomal deficits in AD, compounds ameliorating lysosomal function reduce amyloid β deposits and cytokine secretion. Thus, the tNeuron model system reveals impaired lysosomal homeostasis as an early event of ageing and AD.",Nat Cell Biol

Methanolic Extract Protects the Brain of Male Rats Against Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs as a result of a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is most frequently linked to a decline in cognitive function and memory. Twenty-four male rats were divided into four groups (n = 6); Group I was the negative control, Group II was the AlCl<sub>3</sub>-positive control, and Group III and Group IV were treated with 100 mg and 200 mg/kg of Portulaca oleracea methanolic extract, respectively. Aluminum chloride intoxication in Group II increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant parameters and affected interleukin-6 (IL-6), the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and amyloid beta (Aβ), which lead to the induction of AD through injuring brain cells of AD rats. Treating the AD rats in Group III (GIII) and Group IV (GIV) with P. oleracea ameliorated the altered parameters in the AD rats. It also increased folic acid and vitamin B12 levels. P. oleracea modulated the physiological, biochemical, and histological changes brought on by AlCl<sub>3</sub> intoxication in rats via oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways.

40142342,Morphometric Measurement of Mean Cortical Curvature: Analysis of Alterations in Cognitive Impairment.,"Background and Objectives: Cognitive impairment, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a growing public health concern. Early detection and an understanding of structural changes are crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. Cortical curvature, a morphometric measure derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has emerged as a potential biomarker for neurodegenerative processes. This study investigates the relationship between mean cortical curvature and cognitive impairment. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 58 participants, categorized into, first, cognitively impaired (CI) and non-cognitively impaired (NC) groups and, second, a normal cognitive group (NC), a mild cognitive performance group (MPG), and a low cognitive performance group (LPG) based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. MRI data were acquired using a 3.0 Tesla scanner, and cortical reconstruction was performed using FreeSurfer 7.2.0. Mean cortical curvature values were extracted for 34 brain regions per hemisphere. Results: Significant differences in mean cortical curvature were found between the CI and NC groups. In the right hemisphere, statistically significant changes in mean curvature were observed in the isthmus cingulate (U = 188.5, p = 0.006), lingual (U = 202.5, p = 0.013), pars orbitalis (U = 221.5, p = 0.031), and posterior cingulate regions (U = 224.5, p = 0.035). In the left hemisphere, significant differences were detected in the cuneus (U = 226.5, p = 0.038) and posterior cingulate (U = 231.5, p = 0.046) regions. Analysis across three cognitive performance groups (NC, MPG, and LPG) showed significant curvature differences in the right isthmus cingulate (H(2) = 7.492, p = 0.024) and lingual regions (H(2) = 6.250, p = 0.044). Conclusions: Decreased mean cortical curvature in brain regions associated with cognitive function could be indicative of cognitive impairment and may reflect early neurodegenerative changes. These results highlight cortical curvature as a potential structural sign for cognitive impairment, showing the need for further investigation in longitudinal studies.",Medicina (Kaunas)
40114925,"Ambroxol attenuates detrimental effect of LPS-induced glia-mediated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive dysfunction in mice brain.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are multifactorial. Among various factors, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, are considered potential causative agents. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still no cure. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of ambroxol against LPS-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and the associated cognitive dysfunction. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS (250 µg/kg every alternative day for a total of seven doses over 14 days) triggered glial cell activation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration in the mouse brain. Ambroxol treatment (30 mg/kg/day for 14 days) significantly reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress compared to LPS-treated mice. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence results showed that ambroxol reduced levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and oxidative stress kinase phospho-c-Jun N-terminal Kinase 1 (p-JNK). It also decreased astrocyte and microglia activation in the cortex and hippocampus of LPS+ Amb-treated mice, as indicated by the downregulation of GFAP and Iba-1. Furthermore, ambroxol-reversed LPS-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β and TNF-α, through regulation of the transcription factor p-NFkB. Persistent neuroinflammation disrupted the natural antioxidant mechanisms, leading to oxidative stress. Ambroxol treatment upregulated antioxidant markers, including Nrf-2, HO-1, and SOD, which were downregulated in the LPS-treated group. Additionally, ambroxol-inhibited lipid peroxidation, maintaining malondialdehyde levels in the mouse brain. Ambroxol also improves synaptic integrity by upregulating synaptic biomarkers, including PSD-95 and SNAP-23. Overall, ambroxol demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects in LPS-treated mice, highlighting its potential benefits in neurological disorders.",Front Immunol
40161457,Attenuated heterogeneity of hippocampal neuron subsets in response to novelty induced by amyloid-β.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibited episodic memory impairments including location-object recognition in a spatial environment, which was also presented in animal models with amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. A potential cellular mechanism was the unstable representation of spatial information and lack of discrimination ability of novel stimulus in the hippocampal place cells. However, how the firing characteristics of different hippocampal subsets responding to diverse spatial information were interrupted by Aβ accumulation remains unclear. In this study, we observed impaired novel object-location recognition in Aβ-treated Long-Evans rats, with larger receptive fields of place cells in hippocampal CA1, compared with those in the saline-treated group. We identified two subsets of place cells coding object information (ObjCell) and global environment (EnvCell) during the task, with firing heterogeneity in response to introduced novel information. ObjCells displayed a dynamic representation responding to the introduction of novel information, while EnvCells exhibited a stable representation to support the recognition of the familiar environment. However, the dynamic firing patterns of these two subsets of cells were disrupted to present attenuated heterogeneity under Aβ accumulation. The impaired spatial representation novelty information could be due to the disturbed gamma modulation of neural activities. Taken together, these findings provide new evidence for novelty recognition impairments of AD rats with spatial representation dysfunctions of hippocampal subsets.",Cogn Neurodyn
39983552,Boostering diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with AI-driven neuroimaging - A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) as the second most common dementia encompasses a range of syndromes and often shows overlapping symptoms with other subtypes or neurodegenerative diseases, which poses a significant clinical diagnostic challenge. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to neuroimaging, have significantly progressed in addressing this challenge. This study aims to assess the diagnostic and predictive efficacy of neuroimaging feature-based AI algorithms for FTLD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science for English-language, peer-reviewed studies using the following three umbrella terms: artificial intelligence, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and neuroimaging modality. Our survey focused on computer-aided diagnosis for FTLD, employing machine/deep learning with neuroimaging radiomic features.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis includes 75 articles with 20,601 subjects, including 8,051 FTLD patients. The results reveal that FTLD can be automatically classified against healthy controls (HC) with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 89%, respectively. Likewise, FTLD versus Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification exhibits pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 81%, while FTLD versus Parkinson's disease (PD) demonstrates pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 75%, respectively. Classification performance distinguishing FTLD from atypical Parkinsonian syndromes (APS) showed pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 79%, respectively. Multiclass classification sensitivity ranges from 42% to 100%, with lower sensitivity occurring in higher class distinctions (e.g., 5-class and 11-class).
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing neuroimaging features to distinguish FTLD from HC, AD, APS, and PD in binary classification. Utilizing deep learning with multimodal neuroimaging data to differentiate FTLD subtypes and perform multiclassification among FTLD and other neurodegenerative disease holds promise for expediting diagnosis. In sum, the meta-analysis supports translation of machine learning tools in combination with imaging to clinical routine paving the way to precision medicine.",Neuroimage Clin

40144547,Multimodal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on resting-state electroencephalography and structural magnetic resonance imaging.,"Multimodal diagnostic methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the inclusion of electroencephalography (EEG) in such multimodal studies has been relatively limited. Moreover, most multimodal studies on AD use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from different modalities and perform fusion classification. Regrettably, this approach often lacks collaboration and fails to effectively enhance the representation ability of features. To address this issue and explore the collaborative relationship among multimodal EEG, this paper proposes a multimodal AD diagnosis model based on resting-state EEG and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). Specifically, this work designs corresponding feature extraction models for EEG and sMRI modalities to enhance the capability of extracting modality-specific features. Additionally, a multimodal joint attention mechanism (MJA) is developed to address the issue of independent modalities. The MJA promotes cooperation and collaboration between the two modalities, thereby enhancing the representation ability of multimodal fusion. Furthermore, a random forest classifier is introduced to enhance the classification ability. The diagnostic accuracy of the proposed model can achieve 94.7%, marking a noteworthy accomplishment.

Concurrently, this work strives to bolster the use of EEG in multimodal AD research, thereby positioning itself as a hopeful prospect for future advancements in AD diagnosis.",Front Physiol
40145568,Integrating home-based video teleneuropsychology into neurology clinical practice: Utility in patients with suspected typical or atypical Alzheimer's disease presentations.,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the reliability of home-based video teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) compared to face-to-face (FF) neuropsychological assessments in clinic-referred patients for whom a typical or atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD) syndrome was on the neurologist's differential diagnosis.
METHOD: We conducted a randomized, cross-over clinical trial in which participants underwent neuropsychological evaluations with a core battery of tests in two modalities: FF and TeleNP, conducted approximately 4-6 wk apart. Participants included patients ≥ age 60 years and &lt;90 years who were undergoing evaluation in a memory disorders clinic (n = 63). Board-certified neuropsychologists submitted diagnostic impressions (i.e. syndrome and severity classifications) after the core battery in each modality. Neuropsychologists were able to include a flexible assessment (i.e. inclusion of tests not readily adaptable to TeleNP) after the core battery, only in the FF condition.
RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were at least moderate to good (≥0.50) for 91% of administered tests. Computing ICC adjusting for alternate forms, sequence order, practice effects, referring diagnostic complexity, and supervising neuropsychologist did not substantively change interpretation of ICCs. Across modality types, Cohen's kappa of neuropsychologist impressions for syndrome classifications was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.88), and for severity classifications was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.99). Within the FF modality, kappa of neuropsychologist impressions was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.0), respectively, for syndrome and severity across core and flexible batteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Home-based, video TeleNP is a reliable alternative to FF neuropsychological assessment in older adult patients with suspected cognitive impairment.",Clin Neuropsychol
40089221,Longitudinal changes of blood-brain barrier and transcytolemmal water exchange permeability in Alzheimer's disease mice: A non-contrast MRI study.,"Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked with the dysfunction of glymphatic system. Previous studies were primarily cross-sectional and focused on only one specific component, hindering the understanding of overall glymphatic function in AD. We evaluated the longitudinal changes in multiple components of glymphatic system (blood-brain barrier (BBB) and transcytolemmal water exchange (TWE) permeability) in AD mice. Five female wild-type and four 3 × Tg-AD mice from 5 to 13 months of age were scanned monthly using two non-contrast MRI techniques, water-extraction-with-phase-contrast-arterial-spin-tagging (WEPCAST) and diffusion-time-dependent kurtosis imaging (tDKI), yielding BBB and TWE permeability. Immunostaining was used to evaluate tight junction proteins associated with BBB structural integrity, aquaporin 4 (AQP4) related to TWE, and AQP4 perivascular space (PVS) polarization that might represent PVS-parenchyma water exchange. The relationship between glymphatic function and AD pathology, as measured by amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau deposition, was also explored. Our results revealed significantly increased BBB and hippocampal TWE permeability in AD mouse brains, consistent with the histological findings of reduced tight junction proteins and upregulated AQP4, which were correlated with each other and can be predictive of Aβ and tau deposition. Impaired AQP4 PVS polarization was also found in AD mice. In conclusion, water exchange in multiple components of glymphatic system altered in AD mice, and these in vivo MRI findings were validated pathologically, which might affect the waste clearance in the glymphatic neurofluid.",Neuroimage
39989078,Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarker relationships with incident abnormal amyloid PET.,"INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on the utility of plasma biomarkers to predict incident abnormal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). In this study we evaluate the association of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers with amyloid PET progression among initially amyloid PET negative (A-) individuals.
METHODS: We included 290 A-, cognitively unimpaired Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants. We estimated the association of each baseline plasma biomarker with progression from A- to A+ and with rate of amyloid PET change.
RESULTS: Interquartile range differences in amyloid beta 42/40, percent phosphorylated tau 217 (%p-tau217), and Amyloid Probability Score 2 were associated with 1.29 (P = 0.09), 1.38 (P < 0.001), and 1.20 (P = 0.05) increases, respectively, in the hazard of progression from A- to A+ and 0.27 (P = 0.16), 0.50 (P = 0.007), and 0.28 (P = 0.15) Centiloid/year increases, respectively, in annual rate of amyloid PET change.
DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 may be a useful screening tool to enrich for participants with increased likelihood of progressing from normal to abnormal amyloid PET in a primary prevention trial.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 was associated with amyloid positron emission tomography progression, negative to positive. The associations were weaker for amyloid beta 42/40 and Amyloid Probability Score 2. Age and apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership were also important predictors. These markers may be useful for enrichment of a primary prevention trial.",Alzheimers Dement
40152909,Neuropsychiatric symptoms in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are not part of diagnostic criteria for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease a few retrospective studies and our clinical experience have suggested they are prominent and often occur early. The objective of our study was to assess prospectively the neuropsychiatric features in sCJD (and their impact on caregivers) and compare them with five other neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was given at the first UCSF research visit to caregivers of 789 serial patients evaluated at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center from January 2000 through November 2016 who met diagnostic research criteria for one of the six neurodegenerative disorders. All subjects also had to have a Mini-Mental Status Evaluation (MMSE) and demographic data (age, sex, years of education). We hypothesized that sCJD has a very prominent behavioral and neuropsychiatric profile, which might help distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases. Of our sCJD cohort (n=92), 97% had at least one NPI neuropsychiatric symptom, and half had at least six of the 12 NPI symptom categories, by their first research visit. The most common behavioral symptoms, occurring in more than half of sCJD patients, were: Appetite/Eating Disorders (68%), Apathy/Indifference (66%), Night-time Behaviors (53%), Aberrant Motor Behavior (53%) and Anxiety (52%). Even the least common behavior, Disinhibition, occurred in 19%. Compared to both DLB and bvFTD -- two conditions with very prominent behavioral features and which include behavior in their diagnostic criteria - -sCJD had significantly higher mean NPI FrequencyxSeverity product scores for Night-time Behaviors and Delusions; sCJD also had significantly higher scores for Hallucinations and Depression/Dysphoria than bvFTD and for Appetite/Eating Disorder, Aberrant Motor behavior and Agitation than DLB. sCJD had significantly worse FrequencyxSeverity scores than AD in three-quarters of NPI categories. Our data show that sCJD is a highly behavioral syndrome. Although no neuropsychiatric symptom is pathognomonic for sCJD, certain symptoms might help differentiate sCJD from some other neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings support the inclusion of behavioral symptoms in sCJD diagnostic criteria.",Brain

METHODS: One thousand ninety-two older adults without dementia underwent assessments of scam susceptibility and annual clinical evaluations to document incident AD dementia. Accelerated failure time models examined the relation of scam susceptibility with dementia onset.
RESULTS: During a mean of 5 years of follow-up (standard deviation = 3.1), 188 individuals (17%) were diagnosed with incident AD dementia. A higher level of scam susceptibility was associated with a considerably earlier dementia onset ( β $\beta $   = -0.039; 95% confidence interval: -0.061, -0.017); those with a high level of susceptibility developed AD dementia at a mean age of 90.9 years compared to 98.2 for those with a low level. Results persisted after controlling for global cognition, sex, and education.
DISCUSSION: Scam susceptibility is associated with a markedly earlier onset of AD dementia. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of individuals at risk of developing dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: We examined whether scam susceptibility among older adults is associated with an accelerated onset of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Participants came from a large ongoing cohort study of aging. Scam susceptibility was assessed using a validated measure. Scam susceptibility was associated with a marked acceleration in dementia onset. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement

Genetic variants that influence multiple traits are said to exert pleiotropic effects. The study by Pan and colleagues applied a modern statistical model to identify genetic variants with potentially pleiotropic effects by assessing their joint association with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and another age-related comorbidity (e.g., coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, cancer).

40081796,Multi-functional memantine nitrate attenuated cognitive impairment in models of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease through neuroprotection and increased cerebral blood flow.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are two prevalent forms of dementia. VaD is linked to cerebrovascular lesions, such as those from white matter ischemia and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which can also occur in AD. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the central nervous system. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist approved for AD treatment. This study investigated the efficacy and molecular mechanism of MN-08, a novel memantine nitrate, in one VaD model (2VO) and two AD models (APP/PS1 mice and Aβ1-42-induced mice). MN-08 increased CBF, ameliorated cognitive and memory functions in VaD and AD, and was more effective than memantine. MN-08 increased the survival rate of CA1 neurons and mitigated white matter lesions and axonal damage. Moreover, MN-08 protected neurons from OGD-induced loss and promoted axonal outgrowth in the hippocampus by upregulating phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β), and high-molecular-weight neurofilaments (p-NFH). The beneficial effects of MN-08 were attenuated by carboxy-PTIO, a potent NO scavenger, suggesting that MN-08-derived NO may alleviate cognitive impairment from cerebral hypoperfusion. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MN-08 is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of dementia including VaD and AD.",Neuropharmacology
40030727,DEMENTIA: A Hybrid Attention-Based Multimodal and Multi-Task Learning Framework With Expert Knowledge for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment From Speech.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rising annually, imposing a severe burden on patients and society. Therefore, assisted AD assessment is crucial. The decline in language function and the cognitive impairment it reflects are key external manifestations of AD. Many studies have utilized speech analysis to achieve convenient, non-invasive, and low-cost AD detection. Although state-of-the-art researches achieve high-precision AD detection using multimodal information, these studies often ignore interactions between different modalities and lack explanations for complex models. To address this, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) AD assessment model that combines hybrid attention with multimodal representations. The model fuses audio, text, and expert knowledge to fully capture intra- and inter-modal interactions, achieving simultaneous AD detection and cognitive state prediction, along with comprehensive explainability analyses of the model and various modalities. Results show that the proposed method is sufficiently sensitive in assessing AD, achieving 89.58% accuracy and 91.67% recall for the classification task and a root mean square error of 4.31 for the regression task with good generalization performance. Multimodal representations with expert knowledge and MTL contribute to AD assessment performance. Explainability analyses indicate that, compared to healthy controls, AD patients exhibit slower speech rates, reduced syntactic complexity, and a greater tendency to use pause fillers and pronouns. Therefore, Our study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, addressing trust issues in clinical practice for assisted decision-making and further advancing the development of speech as a promising biomarker for early AD screening and cognitive decline monitoring.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40120943,Differences in brain function entropy due to cognitive impairment: Application of functional near infrared spectroscopy measures during dual-tasking.,"Screening guidelines for cognitive impairment are subjective and inconsistent, often leading to delayed diagnoses. An objective, simple method is needed. Dual-tasking, combined with brain function measurements, may provide sufficient cognitive cost to differentiate between healthy and cognitively impaired populations. It was hypothesized that low complexity (entropy) of brain activity is associated with cognitive impairment, and that dual-tasking would better differentiate between healthy and cognitively impaired groups over resting. Eighty-three participants were recruited: healthy young adults (HY; MoCA = 27.82 ± 1.63, age = 21.13 ± 2.36), cognitively normal older adults (CN; MoCA = 26.59 ± 1.92, age = 75.89 ± 6.93), and mild cognitively impaired/early-stage Alzheimer's disease older adults (MCI/AD; MoCA =18.96 ± 5.69, age = 78.62 ± 8.54). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measured brain activity during a rest and dual-task involving flexion and serial subtraction. The area under the curve (AUC) of multiple scale entropy outcomes was averaged by functional brain regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), front eye fields, motor, visuomotor, and primary sensory. During dual-tasking, the average AUC values across all fNIRS channels were 75.02 ± 12.51, 61.44 ± 14.60 and 42.26 ± 22.89 for HY, CN, and MCI/AD groups, respectively. During dual-tasking, differences between AUC values of CN and MCI/AD groups were significant for the average across all channels, primary sensory, aPFC, and dlPFC regions (p < 0.05). During rest, only the average across all channels was significantly different between CN and MCI/AD groups (p = 0.02). Findings suggest that dual-tasking may better screen for cognitive impairment using fNIRS compared to other task types, especially in regions associated with pathological and behavioral changes in AD.",Int J Psychophysiol
40034527,Associations of oxidative balance score and cognition in US older adults: A cross-sectional study of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011 to 2014.,"BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is linked to cognitive decline in the elderly. Diet, as a key energy source, affects brain function and serves as a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the relationship between the Oxidative Balance Score (OBS), which reflects diet and lifestyle impact on oxidative stress, and cognitive function in older adults.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011-2014, including 2716 participants aged 60 and older. Cognitive outcomes measured were the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word Learning test, Animal Fluency test, and Digit Symbol Substitution test. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the OBS and cognitive performance, with stratification and sensitivity analyses conducted to explore these associations further.
RESULTS: Among 2716 participants, higher dietary OBS scores were linked to better cognitive test performance after adjusting for confounders. For example, the highest OBS quartile had a 4.35-point increase in CERAD immediate recall compared to the lowest quartile (OR: 4.35, 95% CI: 2.14-8.84, p = 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed this positive association across age groups and genders, though it was stronger among non-Hispanic white participants compared to other racial groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a positive correlation between OBS and cognitive function in older adults, suggesting that an antioxidant-rich diet and lifestyle may help prevent cognitive decline in this population. However, since this study is cross-sectional, further prospective research is needed to confirm these results.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40039683,Parallel Multilink Joint ICA for Multimodal Fusion of Gray Matter and Multiple Resting fMRI Networks.,"In this study, we present a multimodal fusion approach, combining gray matter (GM) and multiple resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks via a novel approach called parallel multilink joint independent component analysis (jICA) which combines 4D fMRI with 3D sMRI data. We focus on network-specific reconstruction and estimating joint relationship from differently distributed data by relaxing jICA assumption. Our methodology facilitates a detailed examination of altered connectivity patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study compares healthy controls (HC) and individuals with AD, employing two-sample t-tests with false discovery rate (FDR) correction to rigorously assess group differences. Network-specific correlation analysis reveals the joint relationships between different brain functions, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of AD pathology. Our approach also finds joint independent sources of altered activation patterns in key regions, such as the precuneus of the DMN, paracentral lobule of the sensorimotor domain, and cerebellum. This provides localized insights into the impact of AD on specific brain regions.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40054237,Aflatoxin B1 exposure induces Alzheimer's disease like pathology by disrupting redox homeostasis and activating ferroptotic signals in C57BL/6 J mice.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is one of the most toxic mycotoxins with neurotoxicity. Human exposure to AFB1 via contaminated foodstuffs has been linked to the risk of cognitive impairment, which may contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD in relation to AFB1 exposure is not clear. Herein, C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to 1.5 mg/L AFB1 in drinking water for 8 weeks. It was found that AFB1 damaged blood-brain barrier function, accumulated in the brain, and led to cognitive impairments and AD-like pathology in the hippocampus. Impaired cognitive function was indicated by the significant alterations in Morris' water maze and Y-maze tests at 8 weeks after AFB1 exposure. Concurrently, AD-like pathology was evinced by a marked neuronal loss and the up-regulated AD related gene and protein expressions in the hippocampus. AFB1 exposure remarkably disrupted redox homeostasis and induced ferroptosis both in the hippocampus at 8 weeks after AFB1 exposure and in cultured hippocampal neuron in vitro as indicated by the suppressions on SOD and CAT activities, the down-regulation of Slc7a11/Gpx4 expressions, the decline in GSH content, the increase in MDA and the lipid peroxidation. AFB1 exposure also increased Fe<sup>2+</sup> content significantly at 8 weeks after exposure. In addition, we demonstrated that ferroptosis inhibition by Fer-1 obviously alleviated AFB1 neurotoxicity in HT22 cells. These results revealed an unknown pivotal role of ferroptosis in AFB1 neurotoxicity in relation to AD pathogenesis and emphasized the importance to reduce the health risk of AFB1 exposure as an etiology of AD in humans.",Sci Total Environ
40039723,Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection through Gait Analysis and Standard Cameras.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease impacting older adults' cognitive and functional abilities. Early detection in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage is vital for timely interventions to slow down the disease progression to AD. This study introduces a novel MCI detection that emphasizes accessibility and ease of use, utilizing a regular camera and pose estimation. Using the OpenPose algorithm, we analyzed 25 body joints during walking and extracted 48 gait features, identifying 17 key features that significantly distinguish MCI from healthy controls (HC). Our approach, combining statistical analysis, signal processing, and a machine learning model using a support vector machine, achieved an accuracy and F-score of 86.81% and 82.35%, respectively. This confirms the effectiveness of everyday camera data and pose estimation in detecting significant gait differences between MCI and HC, offering an easy, cost-effective solution for early MCI detection and monitoring in non-clinical settings. It removes the barriers of sophisticated equipment and specialized expertise, paving the way for practical remote monitoring and AD early intervention.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc

Despite the effectiveness of oral formulations, extensive hepatic metabolism and low systemic bioavailability have driven the search for alternative delivery systems. This study focuses on nasal delivery as a non-parenteral substitute, utilizing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) for its mucoadhesive properties and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Me-β-CD) for its ability to enhance permeability and form inclusion complexes with drugs. Prior studies demonstrated the potential of HPMC-based nasal films for nose-to-brain delivery of donepezil and highlighted Me-β-CD's role in improving drug solubility. Building on this, transparent gel formulations containing DH, HPMC, and 2,6 Me-β-CD were developed to investigate molecular interactions within two- and three-component systems. This study utilized a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) to provide detailed insights into the interactions between DH, 2,6-Me-β-CD, and HPMC. The findings provide critical insights into drug-excipient interactions, aiding the optimization of stability, solubility, and controlled release.

Research spanning over two decades highlights the critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage in the pathogenesis of both early-onset and late-onset AD. Emerging evidence suggests impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria is an early pathological event in AD, positioning mitophagy enhancers as potential therapeutic candidates. This study determined the optimal doses of four mitophagy enhancers-Urolithin A (UA), actinonin, tomatidine, and nicotinamide riboside (NR)-using immortalized mouse hippocampal (HT22) neurons. HT22 cells were transfected with mutant APP (mAPP) cDNA and treated with the enhancers. The effects were assessed by evaluating mRNA and protein expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, mitophagy, and synaptic function, alongside cell survival and mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial morphology was also examined in treated and untreated mAPP-HT22 cells. Results showed that mAPP-HT22 cells exhibited increased mitochondrial fission, reduced fusion, downregulated synaptic and mitophagy-related genes, diminished cell survival, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and excessively fragmented, shortened mitochondria. Treatment with mitophagy enhancers reversed these deficits, restoring mitochondrial and synaptic health. Enhanced cell survival, upregulation of mitochondrial fusion, synaptic, and mitophagy genes, improved mitochondrial structure, and reduced fragmentation were observed. Notably, UA demonstrated the most robust mitigating effects. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of mitophagy enhancers, particularly UA, as promising candidates to treat mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions in AD.",Mitochondrion
40107629,Vascular and glymphatic dysfunction as drivers of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from computational approaches.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by complex interactions between vascular dysfunction, glymphatic system impairment, and neuroinflammation. Vascular aging, characterized by arterial stiffness and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), disrupts the pulsatile forces necessary for glymphatic clearance, exacerbating amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and cognitive decline. This review synthesizes insights into the mechanistic crosstalk between these systems and explores their contributions to AD pathogenesis. Emerging machine learning (ML) tools, such as DeepLabCut and Motion sequencing (MoSeq), offer innovative solutions for analyzing multimodal data and enhancing diagnostic precision. Integrating ML with imaging and behavioral analyses bridges gaps in understanding vascular-glymphatic dysfunction.

It can release metabolites that could affect the nervous system. The bidirectional communication between the intestine and the central nervous system is known as the gut-brain axis. This communication can be impacted by the microbiota in various direct and indirect ways. There has been a suggested connection between the microbiome and many neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. This has been explored in human and animal studies. While no microbial biomarkers have been identified yet, alterations in several taxa have been suggested to be associated with disease states.

40074078,Distinct neuronal vulnerability and metabolic dysfunctions are characteristic features of fast-progressing Alzheimer's patients with Lewy bodies.,"Tau protein accumulation is linked to dementia progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with potential co-pathologies contributing to it. The progression of dementia in AD patients varies between individuals, and the association between co-pathology and heterogeneity in dementia progression rate remains unclear. We used longitudinal cohort data, postmortem brain tissues, and biochemical methods such as immunoassays and proteomic profiling to investigate the molecular components associated with progression rate. We report that AD with comorbidities, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and TDP-43 pathology, progress faster than AD alone. AD-DLB patients had higher levels of soluble oligomeric tau proteins and lower levels of insoluble tau proteins compared to those with AD alone. Our data suggest that α-synuclein fibrils may enhance tau aggregation through cross-seeding. The prefrontal cortex is more vulnerable to Lewy body pathology than the temporal cortex, and Tau and α-synuclein aggregate in distinct neuronal populations, indicating selective neuronal and regional vulnerability to their respective pathologies. Dysfunctional metabolic pathways were more strongly associated with fast-progressing AD-DLB patients. Our study suggests that comorbidities, such as α-synuclein aggregation and metabolic dysfunctions, are associated with rapidly progressing AD patients, highlighting the importance of patient subgrouping for clinical trials.",J Biol Chem
40004200,Investigating the Impact of NMDA Receptor Organization and Biological Sex in the APPswe/PS1dE9 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, with women being disproportionately affected in both prevalence and severity. A key feature of AD is synaptic loss, particularly around amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates, which correlates strongly with the severity of dementia. Oligomeric Aβ is believed to be the primary driver of synaptic dysfunction by impairing excitatory neurotransmission through interactions with synaptic receptors, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. However, the influence of sex on these synaptic changes and NMDA receptor mislocalization in AD is not well understood. This study examined potential sex-specific differences in synaptotoxicity and the role of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in AD pathogenesis using the APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model. Although both male and female mice showed a similar amyloid burden and cognitive impairments, synaptic alterations were slightly less severe in females, suggesting subtle sex differences in synaptic pathology. Both sexes exhibited the mislocalization of GluN2B subunits to extrasynaptic areas, which was linked to reduced PSD-95 levels and the synaptic accumulation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Intrahippocampal injections of DL-TBOA confirmed the role of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in memory dysfunction. These findings emphasize the importance of targeting synaptic receptor trafficking to address AD-related memory deficits, potentially offering a therapeutic approach for both sexes.",Int J Mol Sci

40137520,The Neurobehavioral Impact of Zinc Chloride Exposure in Zebrafish: Evaluating Cognitive Deficits and Probiotic Modulation.,"Zinc contamination in aquatic environments has become a growing concern due to its potential to bioaccumulate and induce neurotoxic effects in aquatic organisms. As an essential trace element, zinc plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, but excessive exposure can disrupt the gut-brain axis, leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments. Recent studies have suggested that probiotics may offer protective effects against environmental neurotoxins by modulating the gut microbiota and associated neurological functions. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a valuable model organism for studying the biological mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions. This study aimed to assess the effects of probiotics on cognitive impairments induced by zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) exposure in zebrafish. Specifically, zebrafish were exposed to ZnCl<sub>2</sub> at concentrations of 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L for 96 h, followed by a 7-day post-exposure period to probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium animalis lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus). ZnCl<sub>2</sub> exposure at these concentrations is already known to induce behavioral and neuromotor deficits resembling Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms in zebrafish models, making it a suitable model for evaluating the neuroprotective potential of probiotics. Behavioral assessments including sociability tests along with short- and long-term memory evaluations were conducted using EthoVision XT 16 software. Memory tests demonstrated that ZnCl<sub>2</sub> exposure impaired cognitive functions, while probiotic treatment did not significantly ameliorate these deficits. In the social behavior test, ZnCl<sub>2</sub> at 0.5 mg/L resulted in a marked decrease in sociability, whereas exposure to 1.0 mg/L did not induce significant changes. However, post-exposure probiotic administration following ZnCl<sub>2</sub> intoxication at 1.0 mg/L exhibited an anxiolytic effect on zebrafish. These findings suggest that probiotics may exhibit partial neurobehavioral benefits following zinc chloride-induced toxicity, particularly in mitigating anxiety-like behaviors rather than cognitive deficits. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which probiotics interact with the gut-brain axis in the context of heavy metal neurotoxicity.",Toxics

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of neurodegeneration due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to explore the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and cognitive decline in this population. Methods: We investigated mitochondrial function, brain amyloid-beta burden, and cognitive performance in a pilot study of a cohort of 10 eligible adults with DS selected from a sample of 28 individuals with DS. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) was used to assess mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle using a post-exercise paradigm, while positron emission tomography using <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) measured brain Aβ deposition. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination adapted for individuals with Down syndrome (CAMCOG-DS) and executive function batteries. Results: Significant correlations were observed between slowed phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery in muscle and increased Aβ deposition in key brain regions, particularly the striatum. Cognitive performance inversely correlated with mitochondrial function, with pronounced deficits in memory and executive function tasks. Notably, an individual carrying the APOE-ε4 allele exhibited the poorest mitochondrial function, highest Aβ burden, and most severe cognitive impairment, suggesting a potential interaction between genetic risk and mitochondrial health. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in DS-associated AD (DSAD) and its impact on cognition in adults. The results support targeting mitochondrial pathways as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate AD progression in DS populations. Further research with larger cohorts and longitudinal designs is needed to clarify causative mechanisms and develop effective interventions.",Brain Sci
40137226,A Twist in Yeast: New Perspectives for Studying TDP-43 Proteinopathies in S. cerevisiae.,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the TDP-43 protein in neurons and glial cells. These proteinopathies are associated with several NDs, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and some forms of Alzheimer's disease. Yeast models have proven valuable in ND research due to their simplicity, genetic tractability, and the conservation of many cellular processes shared with higher eukaryotes. For several decades, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model organism to study the behavior and toxicity of TDP-43, facilitating the identification of genes and pathways that either exacerbate or mitigate its toxic effects. This review will discuss evidence showing that yeast models of TDP-43 exhibit defects in proteostasis, mitochondrial function, autophagy, and RNA metabolism, which are key features of TDP-43-related NDs. Additionally, we will explore how modulating proteins involved in these processes reduce TDP-43 toxicity, aiding in restoring normal TDP-43 function or preventing its pathological aggregation. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TDP-43-related diseases.",J Fungi (Basel)
40141149,The Role of IL-17A in Mediating Inflammatory Responses and Progression of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"IL-17A has been implicated as a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging evidence indicates its capacity to activate microglial cells and astrocytes, subsequently inducing the production of inflammatory mediators that exacerbate neuronal injury and functional impairment. Clinical observations have revealed a demonstrated association between IL-17A concentrations and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, creating a pathological feedback loop that amplifies neuro-inflammatory responses. Recent advances highlight the cytokine's critical involvement in neurodegenerative disorders through multiple molecular pathways. Therapeutic interventions utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IL-17A or its cognate receptor (IL-17R) have shown promising clinical potential. This review systematically examines the IL-17A-mediated neuro-inflammatory cascades; the mechanistic contributions to neurodegenerative pathology in the established disease models including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and current therapeutic strategies targeting the IL-17A signaling pathways. The analysis provides novel perspectives on optimizing cytokine-directed therapies while identifying the key challenges and research priorities for translational applications in neurodegeneration.",Int J Mol Sci
40137534,The Effects of Air Pollution on Neurological Diseases: A Narrative Review on Causes and Mechanisms.,"Air pollution has well-documented adverse effects on human health; however, its impact on neurological diseases remains underrecognized. The mechanisms by which various components of air pollutants contribute to neurological disorders are not yet fully understood. This review focuses on key air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and diesel exhaust particles (DEPs). This paper summarizes key findings on the effects of air pollution on neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the precise biological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, evidence suggests that multiple pathways are involved, including blood-brain barrier disruption, oxidative stress, inflammation, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes. This review underscores the role of environmental pollutants as significant risk factors for various neurological diseases and explores their mechanisms of action. By advancing our understanding of these interactions, this work aims to inform new insights for mitigating the adverse effects of air pollution on neurological diseases, ultimately contributing to the establishment of a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.",Toxics
40109529,Monitoring photobiomodulation of amyloid-β aggregation in 3D cultured cells using label-free nonlinear optical imaging.,"The accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide aggregates, commonly known as plaques, is considered a key hallmark in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, low-level light therapy (LLLT), also referred to as photobiomodulation (PBM), has emerged as a promising treatment approach for AD. Previous studies have shown that PBM reduces Aβ load primarily by enhancing the clearance capabilities of glia cells. However, it remains unclear whether PBM can directly reduce the formation of Aβ plaques in neuronal cells independent of the glia cell effect. In this study, we employed three-dimensional (3D) cultured HEK 293 APPsw cells as an AD model to investigate the impact of PBM on Aβ aggregation. We demonstrated that label-free two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) imaging and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging are effective tools for monitoring Aβ aggregation in 3D cell models. The TPEF imaging results and subsequent quantification revealed that PBM, particularly with low-level near-infrared light from an 808 nm laser (compared to 1064, 1210, and 1470 nm lasers), significantly reduced Aβ aggregation, specifically plaques formation, in the 3D cultured cells, with the effect found to be dose-dependent. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of protein expression in the 3D cultured cells revealed that PBM induces overexpression of the LRP1 receptor, which mediates Aβ degradation and thus leads to the reduction of Aβ aggregation. This study highlights the use of label-free nonlinear optical imaging to monitor Aβ aggregation in AD progression and provides novel insights into the effects of PBM on Aβ plaque formation in AD models.",Biomed Opt Express
40110480,Comparing the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in Alzheimer's disease: a network meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs cognitive function and daily living abilities, representing a major public health challenge. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, effective therapeutic interventions targeting both cognitive and functional decline are critical. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the therapeutic effects of music therapy, acupuncture therapy, game therapy, cognitive training therapy, and exercise therapy on AD patients through a network meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up until 2024 were systematically retrieved from multiple databases. Data were extracted, including the first author, publication year, country, total sample size, mean participant age, type and duration of intervention, and outcome measures such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, Activities of Daily Living, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. Statistical analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17 software. The analysis included 52 RCTs with a total of 3,409 participants, offering a strong dataset. The results indicated that game therapy produced statistically significant improvements in mental state and daily living abilities, while acupuncture therapy yielded the most pronounced improvements in cognitive function among AD patients. Notably, the comparative efficacy of these interventions suggests that game therapy may offer short-term benefits, particularly for mental health and functional abilities, whereas acupuncture therapy demonstrated superior long-term cognitive enhancements. In conclusion, tailored physical and cognitive interventions such as game therapy and acupuncture therapy may hold significant potential in optimizing treatment outcomes for AD patients, with implications for both clinical practice and future research.",Front Aging Neurosci
40001102,"Increased risk of chronic diseases and multimorbidity in middle-aged and elderly individuals with early vision, hearing, or dual sensory impairments: insights from prospective cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis.","BACKGROUND: Sensory impairments (SI), including vision (VI), hearing (HI), and dual sensory impairments (DSI), are prevalent with aging, but their impact on disease risk remains unclear. This study investigates the epidemiological and genetic associations between SIs and 10 chronic disease categories and multimorbidity.
METHODS: Using the CHARLS study, participants were classified by their self-reported VI/HI/DSI status in 2011 and 2013 into groups: ""new onset, remission, persistent, and no SI."" Their chronic disease incidence was tracked until 2018 in sub-cohorts respectively. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses used genetic instruments from UK Biobank GWAS data on 88,250/504,307 individuals for vision/hearing loss, with outcome datasets from consortia including FinnGen, DIAMANTE, CKDGen, PGC, GWAS Catalog, and International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium.
RESULTS: The cohort study revealed that persistent HI significantly increased the risk of heart disease (P < 0.001, HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.31-2.03), stroke (P 0.004, HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.16-2.18), chronic lung disease (P 0.002, HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.17-1.99), and emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problems (P 0.016, HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.14-3.60). Persistent VI was significantly associated with diabetes or high blood sugar (DM/Hglu) (P 0.012, HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.11-2.38) and chronic lung disease (P 0.042, HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.02-2.31). MR confirmed these strong or suggestive associations, indicating that HI significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events by 61-170%, bronchitis by 160%, and schizophrenia by 36%. In addition, VI significantly raised the risk of hyperglycemia or diabetes by 2-4% and the risk of lung function decline. Additionally, cohort studies confirmed that early DSI significantly raised the risk of multiple diseases, while MR identified genetic links between VI and hepatic failure, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease, and between HI and hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence from epidemiological or genetic perspectives demonstrates that early exposure to HI/VI/DSI increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. These findings underscore the need for continuous monitoring and timely intervention for SI to manage chronic disease risks in aging populations.",BMC Med
39989009,"Appraisal of the Neuroprotective Potentials of Isoeugenol Using In-vitro, In-vivo and In-silico Approaches.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects the elder population and is linked to behavioral instability and cognitive decline. Only a few drugs are approved for clinical management of AD. Volatile oils and their components exhibit diverse pharmacological potentials, including neuroprotective properties. The current study aimed to evaluate isoeugenol's neuroprotective potentials against cognitive impairments caused by scopolamine.
METHODS: Standard protocols were followed in the In-vitro antioxidant, cholinesterase inhibitory and molecular docking assays. Isoeugenol was initially evaluated for antioxidant potential using DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging assays. Subsequently, AChE/BChE inhibition studies were performed following Ellman's assay. To assess the compound's binding effectiveness at the enzymes' target site, it was docked against the binding sites of cholinesterase. The effect of isoeugenol supplementation on scopolamine-induced amnesia was assessed using Shallow Water Maze (SWM), Y-Maze and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests.
RESULTS: In DPPH and ABTS assays, isoeugenol exhibited considerable efficacy against free radicals with IC<sub>50</sub> of 38.97 and 43.76 μg/mL, respectively. Isoeugenol revealed 78.39 ± 0.40% and 67.73 ± 0.03% inhibitions against AChE and BChE, respectively, at 1 mg/ml concentration. In docking studies, isoeugenol exhibited a docking score of -12.2390, forming two hydrogen bonds at the active site residues of AChE. Further, with a docking score of -10.1632, isoeugenol binds adequately to the BChE enzyme via two arene-hydrogen interactions and one hydrogen bond.
CONCLUSION: Isoeugenol offered considerable protection against scopolamine-induced memory deficits and improved the special memory of the rodents.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40004175,Enhancing Galantamine Distribution in Rat Brain Using Microplasma-Assisted Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery.,"Nose-to-brain (N2B) drug delivery is a promising technique for the treatment of brain diseases. It allows a drug to enter the brain without passing through the blood-brain barrier. However, the nasal cavity and nasal mucosa can restrict the amount of drug absorbed. Recent studies of non-thermal plasma (NTP) have shown improvement in in vitro drug delivery to cells and tissues. However, whether NTP treatments can enhance the in vivo delivery of drugs for neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease (AD) into the brain via the N2B technique remains unclear. The drug used in this study was galantamine hydrobromide. Galantamine is used to treat patients with mild to moderate AD. Based on the principle of NTP, a type of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, which we called spiral DBD microplasma, was designed. It was inserted into the nose of a rat to a depth of 2 mm. The spiral DBD microplasma was driven by a sinusoidal voltage for 4 min, followed by the immediate administration of galantamine. The effect of the microplasma treatment on the distribution of galantamine in the brain was evaluated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). The results showed a high distribution of galantamine in the left and right brain hemispheres of the rat treated with plasma discharge compared to a control treated without plasma discharge. The spiral DBD microplasma is a novel contribution to DBD plasma designs. In addition, this technique for drug delivery has also created a novel approach with potential for becoming a non-invasive method of enhancing drug distribution in the brain for the treatment of neurological disorders.",Int J Mol Sci

Resource-constrained settings such as Northeastern Nigeria face challenges in dementia management.
METHODS: We assessed dementia burden and management at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Maiduguri, the only neuropsychiatric facility in Northeastern Nigeria. This retrospective analysis included patient records from 1999 to 2023 for individuals 60 year of age and older with a dementia diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 1216 cases reported, Alzheimer's disease (60.5%) was the most common subtype, followed by vascular dementia (24.5%). Hypertension (41.6%) was the most frequent comorbidity. Memory loss was present in all cases, whereas behavioral symptoms like agitation presented in some cases. Treatments included cognitive enhancers (donepezil), supplements (gingko biloba), and non-drug therapies (psychoeducation).
DISCUSSION: The increasing burden of dementia at this sole facility highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions and further research to understand the underlying factors contributing to dementia in this population.
HIGHLIGHTS: Dementia trends and management in a neuropsychiatric facility serving over 26 million people in Northeastern Nigeria. Alzheimer's disease accounted for 60.5% of the dementia cases reported, with hypertension as the leading comorbidity. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tools and health care infrastructure to address dementia in resource-constrained settings.

40078964,Profiling hippocampal neuronal populations reveals unique gene expression mosaics reflective of connectivity-based degeneration in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit neurological deficits throughout life including the development of in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive impairment. At the cellular level, dysregulation in neuronal gene expression is observed in postmortem human brain and mouse models of DS/AD. To date, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of hippocampal neuronal gene expression including the characterization of discrete circuit-based connectivity in DS remains a major knowledge gap. We postulate that spatially characterized hippocampal neurons display unique gene expression patterns due, in part, to dysfunction of the integrity of intrinsic circuitry.
METHODS: We combined laser capture microdissection to microisolate individual neuron populations with single population RNA-seq analysis to determine gene expression analysis of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells located in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning, memory, and synaptic activity.
RESULTS: The hippocampus exhibits age-dependent neurodegeneration beginning at ~6 months of age in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS/AD. Each population of excitatory hippocampal neurons exhibited unique gene expression alterations in Ts65Dn mice. Bioinformatic inquiry revealed unique vulnerabilities and differences with mechanistic implications coinciding with onset of degeneration in this model of DS/AD.
CONCLUSIONS: These cell-type specific vulnerabilities may underlie degenerative endophenotypes suggesting precision medicine targeting of individual populations of neurons for rational therapeutic development.",Front Mol Neurosci
40042470,Exploring epidemiological risk factors for cerebral amyloid angiopathy: Considerations for monoclonal antibody therapy in people with Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) increases the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients receiving anti-amyloid-beta therapies, emphasizing the need to identify its risk factors.
METHODS: Data were collected from three cohort studies, and a machine learning model was developed to predict CAA occurrence using the selected risk factors.
RESULTS: The AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC)-CAA association was significantly positive in the cross-sectional analysis. When stratified by selected risk factors, this association was generally stronger among females, smokers, people with a history of stroke/memory complaints, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 carriers, and those without diabetes/heart conditions. In the longitudinal analysis of the association between potential risk factors and CAA, a higher risk of CAA was observed among males, older individuals, smokers, people with diabetes/heart conditions, lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and APOE-ε4 carriers compared to their respective reference groups.
DISCUSSION: Our study identified risk factors for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, informing potential prevention strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: ADNC were significantly positively associated with the risk of CAA. The ADNC-CAA association was generally stronger among females, smokers, people with a history of stroke/memory complaints, APOE-ε4 carriers, and those without diabetes or heart conditions. Longitudinally, higher CAA risk was observed among males, older individuals, smokers, people with diabetes/heart conditions/lower MMSE scores, and APOE-ε4 carriers compared to their reference groups.",Alzheimers Dement
40064283,Pathogenic oligomeric Tau alters neuronal RNA processes through the formation of nuclear heteromeric amyloids with RNA-binding protein Musashi1.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cytoplasmic proteinopathies, primarily involving misfolded Tau protein. Pathogenic Tau species, such as soluble oligomers and fibrils, disrupt RNA metabolism, though the mechanisms are unclear. Recent research indicates that RNA has a crucial role in Tau aggregation. Our study builds on this by noting significant co-deposition of RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) with Tau in AD and Frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) brains. Using molecular and cellular techniques, we investigate the interaction between RNA dynamics and Tau aggregation, focusing on the localization and aggregation of Tau and RBPs, particularly Musashi (MSI), within neuronal nuclei. Through cyto-fluorometric, biochemical, and cellular assays, we reveal the importance of Tau/RBP interplay in primary cortical neurons expressing wild-type and mutant Tau. Pathogenic Tau oligomers alter MSI protein localization and function, causing cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregation. Mass spectrometry of the MSI1 nuclear interactome in Tau models shows disrupted RNA metabolism pathways, including ribosomal biogenesis, RNA splicing, and protein folding. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation assay revealed a remarkable impact of mutant P301L Tau on MSI1 ability to bind RNA targets. These findings highlight potential targets for early neurodegenerative therapeutic interventions.",Prog Neurobiol
40023730,Comparative efficacy and safety of antidiabetic agents in Alzheimer's disease: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Emerging evidence suggests that antidiabetic agents may offer neuroprotective effects by targeting shared pathophysiological mechanisms such as insulin resistance and neuroinflammation. However, the comparative efficacy, and safety of these agents in the treatment of AD remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of antidiabetic agents for improving cognitive outcomes, reducing amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and managing adverse effects in patients with AD, using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases to identify RCTs examining the effects of antidiabetic agents in patients with AD. The primary outcomes included cognitive performance (e.g., MMSE scores), Aβ deposition (measured via CSF biomarkers), and safety/adverse effects. A network meta-analysis was performed to integrate direct and indirect evidence, ranking interventions using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.
RESULTS: A total of 26 studies, involving 7,361 participants, were included in the analysis. The interventions evaluated included insulin detemir (both low-dose and high-dose), liraglutide, exenatide, metformin, and pioglitazone. Both low-dose insulin detemir (mean difference: 2.10, 95 % CI: 1.04 to 3.15), high-dose insulin detemir (mean difference: 1.40, 95 % CI: -0.07 to 2.88), exenatide (mean difference: 1.19, 95 % CI: 0.06 to 2.32), and metformin combined with exenatide (mean difference: 1.06, 95 % CI: -1.68 to 3.80) showed cognitive improvements compared to placebo. Among these, low-dose insulin detemir demonstrated the most significant improvement. In terms of reducing Aβ deposition, metformin ranked highest in effectiveness, with the highest SUCRA score (84.6), followed by high-dose insulin detemir (SUCRA: 54.1). Low-dose insulin detemir (SUCRA: 51.1) also demonstrated moderate efficacy. Low-dose insulin detemir showed some reduction in Aβ deposition (mean difference: -0.31, 95 % CI: -2.82 to 2.20), although statistical significance was limited. Liraglutide exhibited the highest rate of study treatment withdrawal (mean difference: 1.97, 95 % CI: -0.07 to 4.00), while pioglitazone demonstrated the lowest withdrawal rates (mean difference: 0.07, 95 % CI: -0.03 to 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the comparative efficacy and safety of antidiabetic agents in AD. Low-dose insulin detemir demonstrated the most significant cognitive improvement and a moderate effect on reducing Aβ deposition. Metformin emerged as the most effective agent for reducing Aβ levels, though its effects on cognitive function were less pronounced. Safety profiles varied, with liraglutide associated with the highest rate of treatment withdrawals, while pioglitazone demonstrated the lowest incidence of treatment-related discontinuations. These findings support the potential use of antidiabetic agents, particularly insulin detemir, as a therapeutic option for AD, although further studies are needed to confirm their long-term benefits and safety.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40086903,Associations of depressive symptoms and cortisol with cognitive performance among memory clinic patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Test the hypothesis that depressive symptoms are associated with cognitive performance and that cortisol levels may explain this association independently of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker levels.
DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study.
SETTING: Memory clinic, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (n = 162) who agreed to take part in the Cortisol and Stress in AD (Co-STAR) study during 2014-2017 and had data available for variables of interest.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants rated their depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and collected diurnal salivary cortisol samples at home. Cognitive performance was assessed by standardized cognitive tests in the following domains: memory, working memory, processing speed, perceptual reasoning, and general cognitive function. Dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) were diagnosed as part of the clinical work-up. We determined the associations between GDS and cognitive domain scores using linear regressions, including cortisol levels as covariates. We also tested if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers amyloid β42 (Aβ42) and tau proteins modified these associations.
RESULTS: The GDS score was negatively associated with performance in working memory and processing speed, independently of cortisol levels. These associations were no longer significant after introducing AD biomarkers as covariates. Baseline GDS score was not associated with change in memory or processing speed at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The underlying amyloid pathology may affect the association between depressive symptoms and cognitive performance in memory clinic patients.",Int Psychogeriatr
40138021,"Analysis of C9orf72 repeat length in progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, corticobasal degeneration, and atypical parkinsonism.","BACKGROUND: Pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 are the commonest genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There is growing interest in intermediate repeat expansions in C9orf72 and their relationship to a wide range of neurological presentations, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and corticobasal syndromes.
AIMS: To assess the prevalence of intermediate C9orf72 repeat expansions in a large cohort of prospectively-recruited patients clinically diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and atypical parkinsonism (APS), compared with healthy controls. We also sought to replicate the association between C9orf72 repeat length and CBD in neuropathologically confirmed cases.
METHODS: 626 cases, including PSP (n = 366), CBS (n = 130), and APS (n = 53) from the PROSPECT study, and 77 cases with pathologically confirmed CBD were screened for intermediate repeat expansions in C9orf72 using repeat-primed PCR. These were compared to controls from the PROSPECT-M-UK study and from the 1958 Birth Cohort.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean or largest allele size in any affected patient group compared with controls. A higher proportion of our affected cohort had large C9orf72 repeat expansions compared to controls, but there was no difference when comparing the frequency of intermediate expansions between affected patients and controls. There was no relationship between repeat length and age at onset, level of disability, or survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate expansions in C9orf72 do not appear to be a genetic risk factor for PSP, CBS, CBD, or atypical parkinsonism. They are not associated with age at onset, disability, or survival in our study.",J Neurol

However, previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and other predicted damaging missense (DM) variants have not been characterized in a newer release of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).ObjectiveTo characterize previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and DM variants in PSEN2, PSEN1, APP within the participants from the ADSP.MethodsWe identified rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) in PSEN2, PSEN1, and APP in 14,641 individuals with whole genome sequencing and 16,849 individuals with whole exome sequencing available (N<sub>total </sub>= 31,490). We additionally curated variants from ClinVar, OMIM, and Alzforum and report carriers of variants in clinical databases as well as predicted DM variants in these genes.ResultsWe detected 31 previously-reported clinically-relevant variants with alternate alleles observed within the ADSP: 4 variants in PSEN2, 25 in PSEN1, and 2 in APP. The overall variant carrier rate for the 31 clinically-relevant variants in the ADSP was 0.3%. We observed that 79.5% of the variant carriers were cases compared to 3.9% were controls. In those with AD, the mean age of onset of AD among carriers of these clinically-relevant variants was 19.6 ± 1.4 years earlier compared with noncarriers (p = 7.8 × 10<sup>-57</sup>). Additionally, we identified 197 rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) within ADSP participants not reported in known clinical databases.ConclusionsA small proportion of individuals in the ADSP are carriers of a previously-reported clinically-relevant variant allele for AD and these participants have significantly earlier age of AD onset compared to noncarriers.",J Alzheimers Dis
40081988,The late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk factor RHBDF2 is a modifier of microglial TREM2 proteolysis.,"The cell surface receptor TREM2 is a key genetic risk factor and drug target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the brain, TREM2 is expressed in microglia, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage, linked to AD risk, but the responsible protease in microglia is still unknown. Another microglial-expressed AD risk factor is catalytically inactive rhomboid 2 (iRhom2, RHBDF2), which binds to and acts as a non-catalytic subunit of the metalloprotease ADAM17. A potential role in TREM2 proteolysis is not yet known. Using microglial-like BV2 cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and primary murine microglia, we identify iRhom2 as a modifier of ADAM17-mediated TREM2 shedding. Loss of iRhom2 increased TREM2 in cell lysates and at the cell surface and enhanced TREM2 signaling and microglial phagocytosis of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). This study establishes ADAM17 as a physiological TREM2 protease in microglia and suggests iRhom2 as a potential drug target for modulating TREM2 proteolysis in AD.",Life Sci Alliance

It is also produced in smaller quantities by neurons, the gastrointestinal tract, and spinal ganglia. Numerous studies have revealed that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cognitive deficits exhibit IAPP deposits in the pancreas, brain, and blood vessels. IAPP has also been shown to exert neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive impairments. The objective of this review paper is to provide recent information about the pathophysiological roles of IAPP in metabolic and in neurological disorders, and its potential as a druggable target. We have reviewed preclinical and clinical human and animal research studies of IAPP. We discuss the IAPP structure, its receptors, and its physiological functions in metabolism, satiation, adiposity, obesity, and in the brain. Then we discuss its role in metabolic and neurological disorders like diabetes, obesity, bone disorder, neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular disorders, depression, alcohol use disorder, epilepsy, and in ovarian cysts. Overall, this review provides information on the progress of research into the roles of IAPP and its receptor in food intake, energy homeostasis, glucose regulation, satiation, and its role in metabolic and neurological disorders making it a potential target for therapeutic approaches. This review also suggests that the utilization of rodents overexpressing human IAPP in neurodegeneration models may unearth some significant therapeutic potentials for neurological disorders.",FASEB Bioadv

Mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm are key features of the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review provides a comprehensive retrospective and prospective analysis of TDP-43 research, highlighting structural insights, significant milestones, and the evolving understanding of its physiological and pathological functions. We delineate five major stages in TDP-43 research, from its initial discovery as a pathological hallmark in neurodegeneration to the recent advances in understanding its liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior and interactions with cellular processes. Furthermore, we assess therapeutic strategies targeting TDP-43 pathology, categorizing approaches into direct and indirect interventions, alongside modulating aberrant TDP-43 LLPS. We propose that future research will focus on three critical areas: targeting TDP-43 structural polymorphisms for disease-specific therapeutics, exploring dual temporal-spatial modulation of TDP-43, and advancing nano-therapy. More importantly, we emphasize the importance of understanding TDP-43's functional repertoire at the mesoscale, which bridges its molecular functions with broader cellular processes.

The vasculature is an important component of the central nervous system. This review discusses the interaction between vasculature and tau in detail from three aspects. (1) The vascular risk factors (VRFs) discussed in this review include diabetes mellitus (DM), abnormal blood pressure (BP), and hypercholesterolemia. (2) In ADRD pathology, the hyperphosphorylation and deposition of tau interact with disrupted vasculature, such as different cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscular cells, and pericytes), the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the cerebral lymphatic system. (3) The functions of vasculature are regulated by various signaling transductions. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide, calcium signaling, Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing Kinase, and receptors for advanced glycation end products are discussed in this review. Our findings indicate that the prevention and treatment of vascular health may be a potential target for ADRD combination therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: Persistent VRFs increase early disruption of vascular mechanisms and are strongly associated with tau pathology in ADRD. Cell dysfunction in the vasculature causes BBB leakage and drainage incapacity of the cerebral lymphatic system, which interacts with tau pathology. Signaling molecules in the vasculature regulate vasodilation and contraction, angiogenesis, and CBF. Abnormal signaling transduction is related to tau hyperphosphorylation and deposition.",Alzheimers Dement
40147808,Development and validation of global tau severity score in Alzheimer's disease using Florzolotau (18F) PET.,"BACKGROUND: Tau-specific positron emission tomography (tau-PET) is valuable for assessing Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity, with phenotypic differences between young-onset AD (YOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) likely driven by distinct relationships between tau pathology and cognition.
OBJECTIVE: This study developed a global tau severity (gTS) scale using Florzolotau (18F) PET and compared it with the CenTauR score for standardizing tau burden quantification.
METHODS: A total of 186 participants were enrolled, including a pilot group (15 cognitive unimpaired controls [CTL], 15 AD patients) and a validation group (27 CTL, 67 YOAD, and 62 LOAD patients). In the validation group, cutoffs for diagnosing YOAD and LOAD using the gTS or CenTauR score were calculated.
RESULTS: The white matter region was identified as the most suitable reference for Florzolotau (18F). The gTS cutoff values of 24.1 for both AD and YOAD and 34.1 for LOAD demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, as indicated by the area under the curve (AUC). The gTS score showed a higher AUC compared to CenTauR in YOAD versus CTL or LOAD versus CTL. The gTS scores significantly predicted total scores and subdomains on cognitive ability screening instruments. Cognitive-gTS curve features were found to have quadratic and linear relationships with YOAD and LOAD, respectively, illustrating different relationships between gTS scores and cognition.
CONCLUSION: The gTS score, derived from Florzolotau (18F) PET scans, provides significant predictions regarding tau burden and cognitive measurements. The higher AUC of gTS compared to the CenTauR universal scores indicates that gTS scores offer a robust method for differentiating AD from CTL.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry
40011916,ApoE2 affects insulin signaling in the hippocampus and spatial cognition of aged mice in a sex-dependent manner.,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has garnered significant attention as one of the most influential genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the pathogenic role of APOE4 in sporadic AD has been extensively studied, research on the protective effects of the APOE2 genotype and its underlying mechanisms remains limited. Additionally, the existence of sex differences in the protective effects of ApoE2 continues to be a topic of debate. In this study, we utilized humanized ApoE2- and ApoE3- target replacement mice to examine the sex-specific effects of ApoE2 on cognition. Compared with female ApoE3 mice, we found significantly lower spatial cognitive ability and impaired hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure in aged female ApoE2 mice, accompanied by reduced insulin signaling of the hippocampus. Further analyses by target metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that female ApoE2 mice exhibit an age-related decline in hippocampal inositol levels, and that alterations in inositol levels lower insulin signaling. Importantly, inositol supplementation was found to alleviate peripheral glucose intolerance, enhance insulin signaling, and ultimately improve cognitive function. Interestingly, these differences were not observed between male ApoE2 and ApoE3 mice. The research findings not only provide new insights into the impact of ApoE2 on cognition but also offer a new strategy for cognitive improvement through inositol supplementation in older women.",Cell Commun Signal
39994784,Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid levels of VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 in a dementia with Lewy bodies clinical cohort stratified by Alzheimer's pathophysiological biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Synaptic protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may represent much-needed objective biomarkers of cognitive impairment, disease progression and drug efficacy in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNARE) proteins, such as VAMP-2 and SNAP-25, are implicated in α-synuclein pathophysiology and CSF levels of these proteins are associated with pathophysiological biomarkers and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to compare CSF levels of VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 in patients with DLB to cognitively unimpaired controls and AD patients and study their association with cognitive performance and AD and neurodegeneration biomarkers.
METHODS: VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were quantified in CSF from cognitively normal controls (n = 62), DLB (n = 44) and AD (n = 114) patients from the Sant Pau Initiative for Neurodegeneration (SPIN) cohort using homebrew Single Molecule Array assays (Simoa). The DLB group was stratified into two groups with (""DLB + AD"", n = 28) or without AD co-pathology (""pure DLB"", n = 16) using our validated cut-off for the CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau)/Aβ42 ratio. We used linear regression to test for group differences (adjusting for age) and association with AD biomarkers. We used standardized w-scores of the cognitive tests to analyze the association of the synaptic markers with cognitive performance.
RESULTS: CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 levels correlated across all groups (r = 0.71-0.9, p &lt; 0.001). Both proteins were decreased in pure DLB (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.01) but increased in DLB + AD (p = 0.01, p = 0.02) compared to controls and showed good accuracy to discriminate pure DLB from DLB + AD (AUC = 0.84, 0.85). Both proteins were associated with CSF p-tau and total tau (t-tau) across all groups (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.49-0.88, p &lt; 0.001), with the Aβ42/40 ratio in DLB + AD (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.29-0.36, p &lt; 0.001) and in AD (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.12-0.23, p &lt; 0.001) and with CSF neurofilament-light chain (NfL) in controls (r²=0.10-0.11, p &lt; 0.001-0.01) and AD patients (r²=0.01-0.08, p = 0.01 - 0.001). SNAP-25 was associated with CSF NfL in the DLB + AD group (r²=0.15, p = 0.02). CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were associated with phonemic fluency in pure DLB (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.39 - 0.28, p = 0.01-0.03) and SNAP-25 with the Clock drawing test and the MMSE in DLB + AD (adj.r<sup>2</sup> = 0.15 - 0.14, p = 0.03-0.03) and DLB (adj.r<sup>2</sup> = 0.12 - 0.08, p = 0.02-0.04) groups.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 are promising surrogate markers of synapse degeneration in DLB. However, care should be taken when interpreting CSF levels of these synaptic markers in DLB in light of the confounding effect of AD pathophysiological markers.",Alzheimers Res Ther
39997520,The Use and Understanding of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Routine Specialist Care: A Survey Among German Memory Clinics.,"Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and is important for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the expansion of biomarker-based diagnostics, the aim of this study is to clarify the current attitudes towards and the use of MCI, and MCI due to AD, in German memory clinics. Methods: An online survey (50 items) was performed in 2022 among specialized clinicians (N = 45) in German memory clinics to assess the use of MCI and biomarkers in current diagnosis and treatment. Attitudinal and frequency items were assessed with a five-point numeric scale (strongly disagree = 1 to completely agree = 5 and never = 1 to always = 5, respectively). Results: All respondents used MCI as a clinical diagnosis. The benefits of diagnosing MCI were labeling deficits as disease symptoms (M = 4.4, SD = 0.7), improving coping with symptoms (M = 4.1, SD = 0.9), and motivating risk reduction activities (M = 4.0, SD = 0.9). Overall, 37 respondents used specialized diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD, and all had access to biomarker diagnostics. Patients with MCI due to AD received more frequent counseling on memory training (p &lt; 0.001), other non-pharmacological treatments (p &lt; 0.001), and antidementive drug treatment (p &lt; 0.001) than patients with MCI of other etiologies. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed significantly more frequently to patients with MCI due to AD (p &lt; 0.001) compared to other MCI patients. Conclusions: MCI is commonly used as a clinical diagnosis in German memory clinics. AD biomarker assessment is well established and influences patient counseling and treatment recommendations.",Geriatrics (Basel)
40043785,Transcriptomic and network analysis identifies shared pathways across Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are often accompanied, but there are no effective differential diagnosis and treatment for VaD. The search for common pathogenic targets or pathways connecting the two diseases is helpful to the drug development and treatment of the disease. In this study, we used gene expression array data from the GEO database to analyze common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal cortex of patients with AD and VaD. AD and VaD shared 143 DEGs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that the biological function of common DEGs was mainly related to chemical synaptic transmission, neuroactive ligand-receptor, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed the interaction of down- and up-regulated DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of key proteins in neuroactive ligand-receptor and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway were verified in AD and VaD mice. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test was used to detect the expression of DEGs. Data of RT-qPCR showed the mRNA level of γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABBR1) was decreased in both AD and VaD. In addition, the mRNA of interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), IL-17 and IL-18 were increased. In conclusion, the shared genes in AD and VaD were verified in our study. We identified the critical genes to offer a theoretical basis for understanding the linkage of AD and VaD, which provided potential drug targets against AD and VaD.",Brain Res
40081396,Perceptions About Dyadic Physical Activity Intervention for Rural-Dwelling People With Cognitive Impairment.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Rural populations face an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias partially attributed to modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity. The study gathered key community partners' perspectives about (a) feasibility of implementing the telerehabilitation physical activity behavioral (TPAB) intervention, a virtual program aimed at increasing daily stepping with sensor-based monitoring, and (b) necessary adaptions for implementation for rural-dwelling people with cognitive impairment and care partners (dyads).
METHODS: Eleven rural-dwelling individuals (three medical providers, four older adults, and four care partners of individuals with mild cognitive impairment) in Nebraska were recruited for a focus group via fliers and word of mouth. The person-based approach was used to gain the perspectives of participants during a 1-hr group discussion regarding six dimensions of feasibility. Session transcriptions were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Participants highlighted the need to improve physical activity in the community and supported care partners receiving TPAB alongside individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Suggested modifications to TPAB included, establishing a local champion, integrating local resources, involving primary care providers, setting recruitment deadlines, using participant testimonies for recruitment, and emphasizing program individualization.
CONCLUSION: Overall, participants perceived TPAB was practical, feasible, and necessary for rural-dwelling participants with cognitive impairment and their care partners; however, several adaptations and the creation of the Cognitive Impairment Rural Community-TPAB are required to optimize rural implementation. Significance/Implications: There is an identified need for the TPAB intervention with outlined redesign approaches to facilitate intervention development and rural implementation.",J Aging Phys Act
40040194,Deep Learning Analysis of Retinal Structures and Risk Factors of Alzheimer's Disease.,"The importance of early Alzheimer's Disease screening is becoming more apparent, given the fact that there is no way to revert the patient's status after the onset. However, the diagnostic procedure of Alzheimer's Disease involves a comprehensive analysis of cognitive tests, blood sampling, and imaging, which limits the screening of a large population in a short period. Preliminary works show that rich neurological and cardiovascular information is encoded in the patient's eye. Due to the relatively fast and easy procedure acquisition, early-stage screening of Alzheimer's Disease patients with eye images holds great promise. In this study, we employed a deep neural network as a framework to investigate the relationship between risk factors of Alzheimer's Disease and retinal structures. Our result shows that the model not only can predict several risk factors above the baseline but also can discover the relationship between the retinal structures and risk factors to provide insights into the retinal imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40154937,"Using Single-Cell RNA sequencing with Drosophila, Zebrafish, and mouse models for studying Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.","Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are the most common neurodegenerative diseases, significantly affecting the elderly with no current cure available. With the rapidly aging global population, advancing research on these diseases becomes increasingly critical. Both disorders are often studied using model organisms, which enable researchers to investigate disease phenotypes and their underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review, we critically discuss the strengths and limitations of using Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice as models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's research. A focus is the application of single-cell RNA sequencing, which has revolutionized the field by providing novel insights into the cellular and transcriptomic landscapes characterizing these diseases. We assess how combining animal disease modeling with high-throughput sequencing and computational approaches has advanced the field of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease research. Thereby, we highlight the importance of integrative multidisciplinary approaches to further our understanding of disease mechanisms and thus accelerating the development of successful therapeutic interventions.",Neuroscience
39986791,Digestive characteristics of Se-enriched proteins with different Se species and its effects on gut microbiota during in vitro APP/PS1 mice colonic fermentation.,"Cardamine violifolia, cabbage, and soybeans have a strong ability to accumulate selenium (Se), primarily in the forms of SeCys<sub>2</sub>, Se (VI), and SeMet, respectively. This study aims to investigate the digestive characteristics of Se-enriched proteins with different Se species, and its effects on gut microbiota during in vitro APP/PS1 mice colonic fermentation. The results showed that SeCys<sub>2</sub> had the highest bioaccessibility (90.65 %) in Se-enriched C. violifolia protein (H-CVP), followed by SeMet at 84.53 %. In Se-enriched soybean protein (H-SBP), SeMet displayed the highest bioaccessibility at 82.98 %. Conversely, the bioaccessibility of Se (VI) in Se-enriched cabbage protein (H-CBP) was below 20 %, likely due to its conversion to Se (IV). Previous research indicated that, although the bioaccessibility of these Se species was relatively high, their bioavailability remained low. Unabsorbed Se may undergo fermentation in the colon. Consequently, we performed in vitro fermentation using feces from APP/PS1 mice to assess its effects on the gut microbiota of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. The results showed that H-CVP had a prebiotic effect on Bacteroidetes strain, while H-SBP significantly increased the abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillaceae in family level. H-CBP had weaker effects on gut microbiota health with the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Functional gene prediction of 16S rDNA sequencing data inferred that H-CVP may regulate intestinal health through the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, while H-SBP could enhance carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, these findings emphasized the role of H-CVP and H-SBP in maintaining gut health in APP/PS1 mice, and demonstrated their potential to alleviate cognitive impairment.",Food Res Int
40130612,A β-hairpin peptide derived from Aβ forms different oligomers in the crystal state and in aqueous solution.,"The supramolecular assembly of amyloid-β into soluble oligomers is critical Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Soluble Aβ oligomers have emerged as neurotoxic species involved in AD progression and some Aβ oligomers are thought to be composed of β-hairpins. In this work, we report the X-ray crystallographic and solution-phase assembly of a macrocyclic β-hairpin peptide that mimics a β-hairpin formed by Aβ<sub>16-36</sub>. In the crystal lattice, the peptide assembles into a symmetric hexamer composed of two identical triangular trimers. In aqueous solution, the peptide assembles to form an asymmetric hexamer. <sup>1</sup>H NMR, TOCSY, and <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments establish that the asymmetric hexamer contains two different species, A and B. <sup>15</sup>N-edited NOESY reveals that species A is a cylindrin-like trimer and species B is a triangular trimer that collectively constitute the asymmetric hexamer. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) suggests that two asymmetric hexamers further assemble to form a dodecamer. NMR-guided molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics studies provide a model for the asymmetric hexamer and suggest how two asymmetric hexamers can form a dodecamer. Solution-phase NMR studies of analogues show that intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the formation of a hydrophobic core help stabilize the asymmetric hexamer. These NMR and crystallographic studies illustrate how an Aβ β-hairpin peptide can assemble to form different well-defined oligomers in the crystal state and in aqueous solution, providing a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity of Aβ oligomers and new structural models of Aβ oligomers composed of Aβ β-hairpins.",Org Biomol Chem
40057929,Diverse role of S100 calcium-binding protein B in alzheimer's disease: pathological mechanisms and therapeutic implications.,"S100 calcium-binding protein B, a member of the S100 protein family, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, progressive dementia, and severe neuroinflammation. S100 calcium-binding protein B, predominantly secreted by astrocytes, exhibits a dual role in Alzheimer's disease, where at low (nanomolar) concentrations, it exhibits neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and enhances synaptic plasticity, while at higher concentrations, it contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. In addition to its pathological roles in Alzheimer's disease, S100 calcium-binding protein B is also considered a potential biomarker, as increased levels correlate with cognitive decline and disease progression in cerebrospinal fluid. Targeting S100 calcium-binding protein B and/or its interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products seems to be a potential target for therapeutic intervention. The development of multiple treatment approaches, such as pharmacological inhibitors, immunotherapy, and modulation of S100 calcium-binding protein B / receptor for advanced glycation end-products signalling pathways, might help to reduce neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta deposition effectively. This review aims to provide an overview of the role of S100 calcium-binding protein B in Alzheimer's disease and to explore its potential as a treatment target, well-grounded in its dual nature. Understanding S100 calcium-binding protein B's involvement in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease may advance its application as a biomarker and help in the development of new treatment strategies, ultimately improving patients' quality of life.",Inflammopharmacology
40033057,Long-read RNA sequencing atlas of human microglia isoforms elucidates disease-associated genetic regulation of splicing.,"Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, have been genetically implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Mapping the genetics of gene expression in human microglia has identified several loci associated with disease-associated genetic variants in microglia-specific regulatory elements. However, identifying genetic effects on splicing is challenging because of the use of short sequencing reads. Here, we present the isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas (isoMiGA), which leverages long-read RNA sequencing to identify 35,879 novel microglia isoforms. We show that these isoforms are involved in stimulation response and brain region specificity. We then quantified the expression of both known and novel isoforms in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 555 human microglia short-read RNA sequencing samples from 391 donors, and found associations with genetic risk loci in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We nominate several loci that may act through complex changes in isoform and splice-site usage.",Nat Genet
39978482,A new protocol for the development of organoids based on molecular mechanisms in the developing newborn rat brain: Prospective applications in the study of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Brain organoids have emerged as powerful models for studying brain development and neurological disorders COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Current models rely on stem cell isolation and differentiation using different growth factors. Thus, their composition varies according to the protocol followed.
NEW METHOD: We developed a simple protocol to generate organoids from newborn rat whole brain. It is a one-step procedure that yields organoids of consistent composition. The whole brains from 3-day old pups were digested enzymatically. All isolated cells were seeded in culture plates using a basement membrane extract (BME) matrix as a scaffold and cultured in the presence of the appropriate medium.
RESULTS: Hematoxylin-eosin staining of 28-day-old cultured domes revealed their structural integrity, while immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and progenitor stem cells in the structures. To assess whether these organoids can serve as a model to study brain physiopathology, and in particular neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), we determined how these organoids respond upon their exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a potent neuroinflammatory factor. LPS-induced amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. Moreover, the intracellular levels of IL-1β and the extracellular levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ) were also elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, this simple protocol results in the generation of functional brain organoids with a consistent structure, that requires no use of varying factors that may affect the structure and function of the produced organoids, thus providing a valuable tool for the study of the physiopathology of neurodegenerative disorders.",J Neurosci Methods
40119567,New approach to specific Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on plasma biomarkers in a cognitive disorder cohort.,"BACKGROUND: The validation of a combination of plasma biomarkers and demographic variables is required to establish reliable cut-offs for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (AD).
METHODS: Plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, t-Tau, NfL, GFAP), ApoE genotype, and demographic variables were obtained from a retrospective clinical cohort of cognitive disorders (n = 478). These patients were diagnosed as AD (n = 254) or non-AD (n = 224) according to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/Aβ40 levels. An analysis using a Ridge logistic regression model was performed to predict the occurrence of AD. The predictive performance of the model was assessed using the observations from a training set (70% of the sample) and validated using a test set (30% of the sample) in each group. Optimum cutoffs for the model were evaluated.
RESULTS: The model including plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, GFAP, ApoE genotype and age was optimal for predicting CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 positivity (AUC .91, sensitivity .86, specificity .82). The model including only plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, GFAP) provided reliable results (AUC .88, sensitivity .83, specificity .78). Also, GFAP, individually, showed the best performance in discriminating between AD and non-AD groups (AUC .859). The established cut-offs in a three-range strategy performed satisfactorily for the validated predictive model (probability) and individual plasma GFAP (concentration).
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma GFAP levels and the validated predictive model based on plasma biomarkers represent a relevant step toward the development of a potential clinical approach for AD diagnosis, which should be assessed in further research.",Eur J Clin Invest
40065918,Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.,"UNLABELLED: The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine treatment benefit in clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: MCID is a key measure of within-person change in cognition, function, or behavior when it is applied to metrics of Alzheimer's disease progression.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID or minimum within person change (MWPC) can function as useful means of determining if a patient has progressed to thresholds of detectable change.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID/MWPC can be used to determine the number or percent of individuals who have progressed to detectable levels of within-person change, with differences anticipated in active treatment and placebo groups.MCID/MWPC are not measures that are appropriately applied to group outcomes of clinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40138096,Celastrol Ameliorated Alzheimer's Disease in Mice by Enhancing TBX21/TREM2 Expression in Microglia and Inhibiting Tau Phosphorylation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that is typified by the formation of senile plaques containing Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles containing tau in a hyperphosphorylated state. Celastrol, a natural compound, has proven effective in alleviating AD pathology by enhancing autophagy and reducing tau aggregates. The present study investigates the neuroprotective mechanisms of celastrol, with a particular focus on the participation of the transcription factor T-box transcription factor 21 (TBX21) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in microglial cells. In AD mouse models, celastrol upregulated TBX21 and TREM2, suppressed phosphorylated tau and inflammatory cytokines, and restored neuronal viability. In vitro, celastrol-treated microglia enhanced neuronal survival under amyloid-beta (Aβ) stress, effects abolished by TBX21/TREM2 knockdown. Mechanistically, TBX21 directly bound the TREM2 promoter to regulate its expression. These findings identified the TBX21-TREM2 axis as a therapeutic target for AD.",Neurochem Res
40039079,Brain Age Analysis and Dementia Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks trained on Diffusion MRI: Tests in Indian and North American Cohorts.,"Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to classify Alzheimer's disease or infer dementia severity from T1-weighted brain MRI scans. Here, we examine the value of adding diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) as an input to these models. Much research in this area focuses on specific datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which assesses people of North American, largely European ancestry, so we examine how models trained on ADNI, generalize to a new population dataset from India (the NIMHANS cohort). We first benchmark our models by predicting ""brain age"" - the task of predicting a person's chronological age from their MRI scan and proceed to AD classification. We also evaluate the benefit of using a 3D CycleGAN approach to harmonize the imaging datasets before training the CNN models. Our experiments show that classification performance improves after harmonization in most cases, as well as better performance for dMRI as input.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40076254,Vitamin K Properties in Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease: A Janus Bifrons in Protection and Prevention.,"Vitamin K is essential for many physiological processes, including coagulation, bone metabolism, tissue calcification, and antioxidant activity. Vitamin K vitamers are represented by lipophilic compounds with similar chemical structure (i.e., phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone (vitamin K2)). Vitamin K deficiency can affect coagulation and vascular calcification, increasing the risk of hemorrhages, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. Recently, several studies have hypothesized a possible dual role of vitamin K vitamers in benefiting both vascular and cerebral health, e.g., by sphingolipids biosynthesis or ferroptosis inhibition. The aim of this narrative review is to deepen the understanding of biological activities of vitamin K and its possible dual protective/preventive actions in neurovascular and degenerative conditions, e.g., stroke and dementia. Given the difficulties related to hemorrhagic risk entailed in the prevention of strokes, the function of vitamin K antagonists is also investigated. Finally, we track the development of a clinical concept for a future preventive strategy and innovative use of vitamin K as a supplement to counteract neurovascular and pathological processes, focusing in particular on stroke and dementia.",Molecules
40040448,Spiritual Well-Being and Phenoconversion in Huntington's Disease: Analysis from the Prospective Huntington at Risk Observational Study.,"Objective: Spiritual well-being (SWB) has been shown to delay the onset of cognitive decline among older adults predisposed to Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative dementias. It was, however, unknown if SWB is also associated with delay in disease manifestation (""phenoconversion"") in rare, genetic neurodegenerative dementias, such as Huntington's disease (HD). Thus, we sought to evaluate the association between SWB and phenocovnersion in people at-risk for HD. Methods: The ""Prospective Huntington At Risk Observation Study"" (PHAROS), a large-scale national prospective research study, recruited a substantial cohort of 1001 participants. These participants, who were first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with HD and had a 50% chance of carrying the HD genetic mutation, were blinded to their genetic status and underwent repeated clinical assessments every 12 months. The study used Cox proportional models to examine the relationship between SWB and time to phenoconversion while also considering subcomponents of SWB and adjusting for age, sex, and CAG repeat length. Results: The study found no significant association between SWB and time to phenoconversion in individuals with the HD gene mutation. Conclusion: While existing data suggest that SWB may be an actionable target to improve health-related quality of life in HD and other serious illnesses, there is a lack of evidence supporting the role of SWB in attenuating phenoconversion in people with the HD genetic mutation. Unlike Alzheimer's, HD may be less responsive to analogous factors in delaying disease onset.",J Palliat Med
40056267,"Alkaloids from Caliphruria subedentata (Amaryllidaceae) as Regulators of AChE, BuChE, NMDA and GSK3 Activity: An In Vitro and In Silico Approach for Mimicking Alzheimer´s Disease.","Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have two types of abnormal protein buildups: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in addition to the early synaptic dysfunction associated with the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Impairment of the glutamatergic system is also crucial for neuronal survival, as it can cause synaptic dysfunction that overstimulates glutamate receptors, especially N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Another protein affecting neuronal health is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), a widely preserved serine/threonine protein kinase linked to neuronal disorders, including AD. In recent years, alkaloids from the Amaryllidaceae have received great attention for their known anticholinergic activity, as well as their antioxidant, antigenotoxic, and neuroprotective properties. In this context, the identification of compounds capable of interacting with different targets involved in AD provides a possible new therapeutic strategy. In this study, we conducted a combination of in vitro and in silico approaches to identify the potential of C. subedentata in regulating key proteins involved in AD. Viability and neuroprotection assays were performed to evaluate the neuroprotection exerted by C. subedentata extract against neurotoxicity induced by Aβ (1-42) peptide and Okadaic acid in SH-SY5Y cells. Computational methods such as docking and molecular dynamic and viability therapeutic analysis were conducted to explore the interaction of alkaloids from C. subedentata with target proteins (AChE, BuChE, NMDA, and GSK-3) involved in AD. Our findings show that C. subedentata extract exerts neuroprotective effects against neurotoxic stimuli induced by Aβ (1-42) peptide and Okadaic acid. In addition, in silico approaches provide insight into how C. subedentata extract alkaloids interact with key proteins involved in AD. These findings provide insights into the potential therapeutic effects and action mechanisms of these alkaloids. We hope these rapid findings can contribute as a bridge to the identification of new molecules with the potential to counteract the effects of AD.",Neurochem Res
39991795,Cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations: A digital phenotype of neurodegeneration.,"INTRODUCTION: Cognition is reduced at low and high glucose, reflecting cognitive vulnerability to glucose (CVG) fluctuations. The impact of glucose fluctuations on the aging brain remains unclear. We examined whether CVG is associated with plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Participants included N = 114 adults with type 1 diabetes assessed for processing speed and sustained attention using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We characterized associations between CVG and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein.
RESULTS: CVG was associated with all plasma biomarkers, except Aβ 42/40. CVG for sustained attention exhibited strong associations with p-tau biomarkers that persisted across covariate specifications.
DISCUSSION: CVG may be a useful digital phenotype of AD. It remains unclear whether CVG contributes to versus arises from neurodegeneration. We consider possible mechanisms linking cognitive vulnerability and long-term glucose variability to the development of neuropathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive vulnerability to glucose (CVG) may be a useful digital phenotype of neurodegeneration. We used cognitive ecological momentary assessment and continuous glucose monitoring to investigate CVG's associations with plasma biomarkers. Associations of CVG for sustained attention and phosphorylated tau 181 remained significant across covariates. We discuss possible mechanisms relating glucose variability, cognition, and neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement
40102464,Stages prediction of Alzheimer's disease with shallow 2D and 3D CNNs from intelligently selected neuroimaging data.,"Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for successful diagnosis and treatment, involving the common practice of screening for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, the progressive nature of AD makes it challenging to identify its causal factors. Modern diagnostic workflows for AD use cognitive tests, neurological examinations, and biomarker-based methods, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. While these methods are effective, non-invasive imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining importance. Deep Learning (DL) approaches for evaluating alterations in brain structure have focused on combining MRI and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the spatial architecture of DL. This combination has garnered significant research interest due to its remarkable effectiveness in automating feature extraction across various multilayer perceptron models. Despite this, MRI's noisy and multidimensional nature requires an intelligent preprocessing pipeline for effective disease prediction. Our study aims to detect different stages of AD from the multidimensional neuroimaging data obtained through MRI scans using 2D and 3D CNN architectures. The proposed preprocessing pipeline comprises skull stripping, spatial normalization, and smoothing. It is followed by a novel and efficient pixel count-based frame selection and cropping approach, which renders a notable dimension reduction. Furthermore, the learnable resizer method is applied to enhance the image quality while resizing the data. Finally, the proposed shallow 2D and 3D CNN architectures extract spatio-temporal attributes from the segmented MRI data. Furthermore, we merged both the CNNs for further comparative analysis. Notably, 2D CNN achieved a maximum accuracy of 93%, while 3D CNN reported the highest accuracy of 96.5%.",Sci Rep
40044513,Qualitative research and literature review support the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) content validity in early symptomatic AD.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) is a measure of cognition and daily function used to evaluate treatment effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. This study aimed to assess the content validity of the iADRS in early symptomatic AD, and to determine whether integrating assessment of cognition and function into a single measure of global disease severity is supported by the patients' experience.
METHODS: A targeted literature review of qualitative research in AD and qualitative interviews with 25 care partners of individuals with early symptomatic AD were conducted. Interviews started with open-ended concept elicitation exploring the patient experience of AD from the care partner perspective, including how cognitive changes affect daily functioning. This was followed by cognitive debriefing of the ADCS-iADL items. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Concepts extracted from the literature review and interviews were categorized into a conceptual model of patient experience of AD. A concept-to-item mapping exercise was conducted to assess the conceptual coverage of the iADRS.
RESULTS: The literature review comprised sixty articles. Interviews were conducted with care partners of 7 individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-AD and care partners of 18 individuals with dementia due to AD. The resulting conceptual model incorporated 75 concepts related to AD experience categorized into three overarching domains: Cognition, Daily Function and Other Symptoms/Impacts. Interview findings endorsed the close link between cognition and daily function. Concept-to-item mapping demonstrated all Cognition and Daily function sub-domains within the model were assessed by at least one iADRS item, except Work/Professional, providing supportive evidence that the iADRS covers concepts that reflect the patient experience of early symptomatic AD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a comprehensive conceptualisation of the patient experience of early symptomatic AD and highlights the intrinsic connection between cognition and daily function. The findings endorse the relevance of an integrated assessment of cognition and function and provide strong evidence for the content validity of the iADRS, highlighting its utility as a meaningful clinical outcome assessment (COA) for use as an endpoint in AD.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40032841,Zipper-interacting protein kinase mediates neuronal cell death and cognitive dysfunction in traumatic brain injury via regulating DEDD.,"Neuronal cell death is a causative process in traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced structural and functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, the upstream trigger of TBI-induced neuronal loss and the underlying molecular pathways remain unclear. Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) has been shown to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke and to play a role in cellular apoptosis, while its pathological significance in TBI has not been reported. Herein, we discovered for the first time that ZIPK expression was markedly elevated in neurons after TBI and that ZIPK caused massive neuronal apoptosis in peri-contusional brain regions. Zipk haploinsufficiency antagonized neuronal cell death and reversed several typical neuropathological changes induced by TBI. Mechanistically, we found that ZIPK affected neuronal viability by modulating death effector domain-containing DNA binding protein (DEDD) and caspase-3 pathway. Specifically, ZIPK could bind to and phosphorylate DEDD at the S9 residue, thus enhancing the stability of DEDD, and leading to the activation of caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cascade in neurons. The rescue of neuronal loss by ZIPK downregulation effectively alleviated TBI-induced behavioral deficits by preserving motor and cognitive abilities in vivo, supporting the decisive role of ZIPK dysregulation in TBI-associated neuronal dysfunctions by modulating neuronal survival. Furthermore, pharmacological suppression of ZIPK activity by a specific inhibitor prior to TBI protected neurons from brain injury-induced cell death and neuronal degeneration in vitro and in vivo by preventing DEDD upregulation and caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, our data reveal the essential contribution of ZIPK to TBI-induced neuronal cell death through the DEDD/caspase-3 cascade, and suggest the potential of targeting ZIPK as an effective strategy for treating TBI-related neuropathologies.",Cell Death Dis
40116704,Exploring interdisciplinary perspectives on the implementation of personalized medicine and patient-orchestrated care in Alzheimer's disease: A qualitative study within the ABOARD research project.,"BackgroundThe concepts of 'personalized medicine' and 'patient-orchestrated care' in Alzheimer's disease (AD) lack standard conceptualization, which presents challenges for collaborative and interdisciplinary care.ObjectiveWe explored the interpretations and perspectives of professionals involved in interdisciplinary work on a large-scale project, ""ABOARD"", with the aim to implement personalized medicine and patient-orchestrated care in AD.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 professionals and audio-recorded. Two researchers independently coded the data inductively, followed by a thematic analysis.ResultsAccording to professionals across different disciplinary backgrounds (mean age 45.7 years; 53.3% female), personalized medicine pertains to the relevant options that an individual has, informed by biomedical and psychosocial factors, whereas patient-orchestrated care captures factors relevant to the decision-making process. Professionals differed in their views on patient-orchestrated care regarding its desirability and feasibility. The concepts were viewed as similar by professionals, as both involve personal preferences while ultimately assigning responsibility to the clinician. However, implementation challenges persist, and no thematic differences were found between clinicians and other AD-related professionals.ConclusionsAD professionals have shared interpretations and perspectives on implementation of personalized medicine but differed in their views on patient-orchestrated care. Personal preferences are seen as part of personalized medicine, but not yet reflected in definitions in the AD field and beyond. Critical discussions on the challenges and existing doubts are necessary for both personalized medicine and patient-orchestrated care. Multi-level implementation changes are needed for both concepts, which warrants stakeholder involvement as well as support and resources from the entire AD field.",J Alzheimers Dis
40046785,"Talking during walking: the diagnostic potential of turn dynamics in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitive aging.","BACKGROUND: While gait analysis is well-documented, turn performance-which is a more complex task and involves multiple brain regions-has been less explored. This study aims to assess the diagnostic potential of turn dynamics as a novel tool for detecting cognitive decline.
METHODS: We recruited 75 participants, including 26 neurotypical (NT) older adults, 25 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 24 with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants completed a dual-task walk and turn (DTWT) test using a dual Kinect setup while counting backwards by ones. Key measures analyzed included spatial-temporal parameters of gait and turn dynamics. Statistical analyses including analyses of variance and linear regression were performed to identify key features as well as to assess their correlation with cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Gait speed and stride time significantly differentiated among groups in DTWT conditions. More notably, turn dynamics, particularly segmental peak speeds and step length, displayed stronger discriminatory power with more significant p-values compared to gait features. Linear regression analysis indicated that turn dynamics had stronger correlations with executive function and working memory, suggesting a more pronounced relationship between cognitive performance and turn features than gait variables.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to straight walk metrics, this study shows that DTWT turn dynamics are more sensitive to detect cognitive impairment. Consequently, incorporating turning movements into gait analysis techniques could enhance diagnostic protocols in clinical settings, offering a valuable tool for monitoring the progression of conditions associated with cognitive aging.",Front Aging Neurosci
40058206,A versatile biosensor for detecting Zn<sup>2 +</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> in Alzheimer's disease cells and acidic foods via RNA G-quadruplex hydrolysis.,"Zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) and copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) are essential micronutrients that also have the potential to act as pollutants, and their imbalance in the human body has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study presents the development of a versatile RNAzyme-based biosensor capable of selectively detecting Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> in both Alzheimer's disease model cells and acidic food matrices. This biosensor is composed of a cyanine dye (SCY-5) and an artificially synthesized RNA G-quadruplex (G4). It functions through the specific binding of SCY-5 to G4s, the enzymatic hydrolysis of G4s by RNase T2, and the inhibition of RNase T2 activity by these metal ions. The biosensor effectively tracked variations in Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> levels within living AD cells, demonstrating a significant correlation between fluctuating metal ion concentrations and the severity of AD pathology. Additionally, it proved efficient in quantifying metal content in acidic foods. These findings highlight the biosensor's dual applicability in monitoring critical metal ion concentrations both in neurodegenerative disease research and in food safety, underscoring its potential as a valuable tool for environmental health and biomedical applications.",J Hazard Mater
40153089,Efficacy of curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion in alleviating oxidative damage induced by aluminum chloride in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disorder primarily affecting older adults. A hallmark of this condition is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to increased oxidative stress and cellular damage. Treatment with a curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion has been shown to enhance behavioural performance and mitigate degenerative changes induced by aluminium chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>). This nanoemulsion also reduced the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lowered levels of key proteins, including Aβ, p53, tau, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Additionally, it significantly decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels in the brain while enhancing the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The study highlights the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic option for alleviating AD induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub>. These results are further supported by improvements in the histological structure of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as enhanced immunohistochmical assessment of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cur- Se-nanoemulsion, the current drug delivery technology, may lower the amount of amyloid-β in AD rat brain and considerably ameliorate the memory deficit that improve therapy efficacy in AD lesions.",J Mol Histol
40071147,IQGAP2 regulates blood-brain barrier immune dynamics.,"Brain endothelial cells (BECs) play an important role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis through blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions. BECs express low baseline levels of adhesion receptors, which limits entry of leukocytes. However, the molecular mediators governing this phenotype remain mostly unclear. Here, we explored how infiltration of immune cells across the BBB is influenced by the scaffold protein IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 2 (IQGAP2). In mice and zebrafish, we demonstrate that loss of Iqgap2 increases infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the CNS under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistology, we further show that BECs from mice lacking Iqgap2 exhibit a profound inflammatory signature, including extensive upregulation of adhesion receptors and antigen-processing machinery. Human tissue analyses also reveal that Alzheimer's disease is associated with reduced hippocampal IQGAP2. Overall, our results implicate IQGAP2 as an essential regulator of BBB immune privilege and immune cell entry into the CNS.",iScience
40120713,Refining the interactions between microglia and astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Microglia and astrocytes are central to the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), working both independently and collaboratively to regulate key pathological processes such as β-amyloid protein (Aβ) deposition, tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, and synapse loss. These glial cells interact through complex molecular pathways, including IL-3/IL-3Ra and C3/C3aR, which influence disease progression and cognitive decline. Emerging research suggests that modulating these pathways could offer therapeutic benefits. For instance, recombinant IL-3 administration in mice reduced Aβ plaques and improved cognitive functions, while C3aR inhibition alleviated Aβ and tau pathologies, restored synaptic function, and corrected immune dysregulation. However, the effects of these interactions are context-dependent. Acute C3/C3aR activation enhances microglial Aβ clearance, whereas chronic activation impairs it, highlighting the dual roles of glial signaling in AD. Furthermore, C3/C3aR signaling not only impacts Aβ clearance but also modulates tau pathology and synaptic integrity. Given AD's multifactorial nature, understanding the specific pathological environment is crucial when investigating glial cell contributions. The interplay between microglia and astrocytes can be both neuroprotective and neurotoxic, depending on the disease stage and brain region. This complexity underscores the need for targeted therapies that modulate glial cell activity in a context-specific manner. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying microglia-astrocyte interactions, this research advances our understanding of AD and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and related disorders.",Neuroscience
39988572,Retinal vascular alterations in cognitive impairment: A multicenter study in China.,"INTRODUCTION: Foundational models suggest Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be diagnosed using retinal images, but the specific structural features remain poorly understood. This study investigates retinal vascular changes in individuals with cognitive impairment in three East Asian regions.
METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Ningxia, collecting retinal images from 176 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and 264 controls. The VC-Net deep learning model segmented arterial/venous networks, extracting 36 vascular features.
RESULTS: Significant reductions in vessel length, segment number, and vascular density were observed in cognitively impaired patients, while venous structure and complexity were correlated with the level of cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Retinal vascular changes may serve as indicators of cognitive impairment, requiring validation in larger cohorts and exploration of the underlying mechanisms.
HIGHLIGHTS: A deep learning segmentation model extracted diverse retinal vascular features. Significant alterations in the structure of retinal arterial/venous networks were identified. Partitioning vessel-rich retinal zones improved detection of vascular changes. Decreases in vessel length, segment number, and vascular density were found in CI individuals.",Alzheimers Dement
40034516,"Sleepiness, sleep time, and depression of caregivers are linked with sleep and behaviors of their paired partners with dementia.","BACKGROUND: Sleep difficulties in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers (CGs) have been documented. Additionally, sleep disturbances are a risk for AD indicating that poor sleep in CGs may place them at risk for AD. Little is known about the relationship between sleep in people with dementia (PWD) and their CGs.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines sleep in PWD and CGs dyads, and the relationship between PWD sleep and CG sleep, cognition, and burden. We explore whether disordered sleep, degree of dementia and PWD behaviors are related to CG sleep difficulties and burden.
METHODS: We examined sleep using overnight polysomnography (PSG) and day/night activity using 14-day actigraphy in PWD/CG dyads form the Virginia Alzheimer's Disease Center Clinical Cohort. Dyad members received the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), behavioral and mood assessments. CGs completed CG burden and preparedness assessments.
RESULTS: Mean activity from actigraphy did not differ within dyad members. PSG measurement of total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SEff), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) revealed that CGs had significantly decreased TST compared to their PWD and experienced greater SOL. Lower PWD MoCA scores were unrelated to CG sleep. However, PWD neuropsychiatric symptoms and CG burden correlated with worse CG SOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that chronic rest and activity are linked within dyad members and that when separated, CGs experience shorter TST, lower SEff, and longer SOL than their partners. Additionally neuropsychiatric symptoms and CG burden were associated with worse CG sleep.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40034521,"Novel donepezil-tacrine hybrid (TAHB3) induces neurodifferentiation, neuroprotective effects, and activates the PI3K/AKT pathway on PC12 cells.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the impairment of cognitive functions and neuronal loss. AD has no cure; current treatments like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) alleviate symptoms but do not halt disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of two novel AChEI hybrid compounds (TAHB3 and TA8Amino), regarding cytotoxicity, neuroprotection and neurodifferentiation in PC12 cells.
METHODS: The effects of TAHB3 and TA8Amino on neurodifferentiation were analyzed on PC12 cells which were treated with AChEI compounds for seven days, following morphological, and quantitative analyses to calculate the differentiation percentages, neurite length, and protein expression. Regarding cytotoxicity and neuroprotection assays, PC12 cells were differentiated into mature neurons, then treated with TAHB3 or TA8Amino, following a posttreatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (an inducer of oxidative damage); the analyses were performed using the XTT assay and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The hybrid compound TAHB3 induced differentiation of PC12 cells, but TA8Amino did not cause the same effect. Both compounds did not show cytotoxic effects to PC12 cells and did not change the cell cycle progression, nor induce cell death. Only TAHB3 showed neuroprotective potential against induced-oxidative damage, and TAHB3 increased the levels of p-AKT, suggesting its action through the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that TAHB3 can induce neurodifferentiation, besides a neuroprotective activity, indicating the potential of AChEI hybrid compounds as novel candidates to be explored for the establishment of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40038870,"Role of iron in brain development, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases.","It is now understood that iron crosses the blood-brain barrier via a complex metabolic regulatory network and participates in diverse critical biological processes within the central nervous system, including oxygen transport, energy metabolism, and the synthesis and catabolism of myelin and neurotransmitters. During brain development, iron is distributed throughout the brain, playing a pivotal role in key processes such as neuronal development, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. In physiological aging, iron can selectively accumulate in specific brain regions, impacting cognitive function and leading to intracellular redox imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation, thereby accelerating aging and associated pathologies. Furthermore, brain iron accumulation may be a primary contributor to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

40018684,Association between depressive status and mild cognitive impairment in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults from CHARLS study.,"BACKGROUND: The potential association between depressive status and the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains unclear, especially in the absence of prospective evidence. This study aims to elucidate the impact of either depression score or depression on the risk of MCI using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).
METHODS: This prospective study included 5,766 participants from CHARLS followed from 2011 to 2015. We calculated the baseline depression score using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) and the cognitive status score after 3 years of follow-up through four dimensions: orientation, memory, calculation, and draw. We collected baseline sociological characteristics and health-related factors as covariates, using multivariate-adjusted logistics regression models (odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to estimate the effect of depressive status on MCI risk.
RESULTS: We observed 724 new cases of MCI at follow-up. Logistics regression analysis showed that participants with depression had a 58% higher risk of developing MCI than those without depression (OR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.35-1.85), and the positive association persisted after adjusting for covariates such as sociological characteristics of the population and health-related factors (OR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.04-1.48). We also observed a dose-response relationship between depression score and MCI risk, with participants with 11~20 and 21~30 scores having a progressively higher risk of MCI compared to participants with depression score of 0~10 (p for trend < 0.05), and a 3% increase in MCI risk for each 1-point increase in depression scores (OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04). RCS analysis also showed a nonlinear association between depression score and MCI risk (p for non-linearity = 0.001), with MCI risk increasing with increasing depression score. In addition, stratified analyses based on sex, age, marital status, residence, BMI, nighttime sleep, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, baseline serological indicators, and comorbidities showed no interaction (p for interaction > 0.05) other than serum total cholesterol levels (p for interaction = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Among middle-aged and elderly adults from CHARLS, depression is an independent risk factor for MCI, indicating that individuals with more severe depression symptoms are more likely to suffer from MCI. Early depression screening based on CESD-10 may help identify individuals at high risk of MCI, and early intervention may reduce the incidence of MCI and Alzheimer's disease, thereby reducing the social care burden of an ageing population.",Front Psychiatry
40125832,Aloe-Emodin Improves Mitophagy in Alzheimer's Disease via Activating the AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3 Signaling Pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Impaired mitophagy results in the accumulation of defective mitochondria that are unable to be cleared effectively in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aloe-emodin (AE), a key component of the traditional Chinese medicine Rhubarb, exhibits neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Studying aloe-emodin's role in enhancing mitophagy is vital for improving cognitive function and reducing neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: The APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were adopted as models for AD to assess the effects of aloe-emodin upon cognitive function and its neuroprotective impact on hippocampal neurons. Additionally, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of proteins within the aforementioned pathway, and the morphological characteristics of mitophagy-related proteins. An AD hippocampal neuron model was developed using Aβ25-35 to evaluate the mitochondrial function, the protein expression of such a pathway and the mitophagy. This approach aims to elucidate the effects and underlying mechanisms of aloe-emodin in relation to AD.
RESULTS: AE activates mitophagy in neurons, improves cognitive dysfunction, reduces hippocampal damage, and alleviates AD symptoms in model mice. AE activates the expression of AMPK, PGC-1α and SIRT3. Increased expression of SIRT3 in mitochondria promotes mitophagy and regulates the function of mitochondrial proteins. When mitochondrial autophagy is enhanced, the expression of Beclin1, LC3, P62, Parkin, and PINK1-related proteins changes. Further in vitro experiments showed that AE can enhance mitochondrial function in Alzheimer's disease cell models. The mitochondrial membrane potential, GSH, ROS and Ca2+ levels gradually recover, alleviating the pathological manifestations of AD. Knocking down SIRT3 leads to increased mitochondrial damage and a reduction in mitophagy in HT22 cells.
CONCLUSION: Experimental results show that AE can activate mitophagy through AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3 pathway, alleviate cognitive dysfunction in AD, and reduce damage to hippocampal neurons.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40166467,Traditional Chinese Medicine-derived formulations and extracts modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory decline, cognitive impairment, and behavioral abnormalities. Pathologically, AD is marked by neurofibrillary tangles caused by excessive phosphorylation of Tau protein and abnormal deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development, survival, and metabolic regulation of the central nervous system, particularly in neuronal growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, this pathway is often inhibited in AD patients.In recent years, studies have shown that herbal formulations and extracts derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby improving AD pathological models. This study reviews fundamental research on both active metabolites and compound formulations from TCM for the treatment of AD, targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.Keywords include ""Alzheimer's disease"" ""AD"" ""dementia"" ""PI3K"" ""AKT"" ""Traditional Chinese Medicine"" ""Chinese herbology"" ""Chinese medicine"" and ""TCM"".The study is based on relevant literature published over the past 15 years, primarily sourced from electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases.The findings indicate that herbal formulations and extracts derived from TCM can mitigate AD pathology by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reducing Tau protein phosphorylation and Aβ deposition, inhibiting inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, and alleviating neuronal apoptosis. This study enhances our understanding of the anti-AD mechanisms of TCM through the PI3K/AKT pathway and offers new insights for the future.",Front Pharmacol

In a head-to-head comparison study including nine cohorts and 1,474 individuals, we show that plasma p-tau217 and medial temporal lobe tau-PET signal display similar associations with cognitive decline on a global cognitive composite test (R<sup>2</sup><sub>PET</sub> = 0.34 versus R<sup>2</sup><sub>plasma</sub> = 0.33, P<sub>difference</sub> = 0.653) and with progression to mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio (HR)<sub>PET</sub> = 1.61 (1.48-1.76) versus HR<sub>plasma</sub> = 1.57 (1.43-1.72), P<sub>difference</sub> = 0.322). Combined plasma and PET models were superior to the single-biomarker models (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, P &lt; 0.01). Sequential selection using plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) and then tau-PET reduced the number of participants required for a clinical trial by 94%, compared to a 76% reduction when using plasma p-tau217 alone. Thus, plasma p-tau217 and tau-PET showed similar performance for predicting future cognitive decline in CU individuals, and their sequential use enhances screening efficiency for preclinical AD trials.",Nat Aging

40113179,Delayed niacin skin flush response identifies cognitive impairment in late-life depression.,"OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to inspect the discriminative and predictive utility of the niacin skin flush response (NSFR) in patients with late-life depression (LLD) with cognitive impairment (CI).
METHODS: This study consisted of 86 LLD patients (46 with CI and 40 without CI), along with 22 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 32 healthy elderly controls (HCs) as positive and negative controls, respectively. A subset of 74 LLD patients were reassessed after six months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered to assess cognitive capabilities. NSFR tests were performed using a modified protocol. Group differences in NSFR and clinical parameters were examined using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves derived from NSFR measurements.
RESULTS: NSFR showed a significant inverse correlation with cognitive functions in LLD patients (R = -0.456, P &lt; .001). Moreover, the parameter logEC<sub>50</sub>, which quantifies the NSFR rate, was elevated in the LLD with CI group. LogEC<sub>50</sub> had an AUC of 0.767 (95 % CI: 0.667-0.867) in distinguishing LLD with CI from those without CI, which increased to 0.961 (95%CI:0.925-0.998) when combined with C- reactive protein. The predictive capacity of the baseline logEC<sub>50</sub> for cognitive prognosis (decline versus preservation) in LLD patients was statistically significant (AUC = 0.826, 95 % CI 0.731-0.921), which increased to 0.857 (95%CI:0.775-0.941) when combined with baseline MoCA.

We investigate risk relationships between 26 autoimmune disorders and AD using retrospective observational case-control and cohort study designs based on electronic health records for >300,000 individuals at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Stanford University. We discover that autoimmune disorders are associated with increased AD risk (odds ratios [ORs] 1.4-1.7) across study designs, primarily driven by endocrine, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and musculoskeletal disorders. We also find that autoimmune disorders associate with increased AD risk in both sexes, but the AD sex disparity remains in those with autoimmune disorders: women exhibit higher AD prevalence than men. This study identifies consistent associations between autoimmune disorders and AD across study designs and two real-world clinical databases, establishing a foundation for exploring how autoimmunity may contribute to AD risk.",Cell Rep Med
39985487,"Machine learning prediction of tau-PET in Alzheimer's disease using plasma, MRI, and clinical data.","INTRODUCTION: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a reliable neuroimaging technique for assessing regional load of tau pathology in the brain, but its routine clinical use is limited by cost and accessibility barriers.
METHODS: We thoroughly investigated the ability of various machine learning models to predict clinically useful tau-PET composites (load and laterality index) from low-cost and non-invasive features, for example, clinical variables, plasma biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: Models including plasma biomarkers yielded the most accurate predictions of tau-PET burden (best model: R-squared = 0.66-0.69), with especially high contribution from plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217). MRI variables were the best predictors of asymmetric tau load between the two hemispheres (best model: R-squared = 0.28-0.42). The models showed high generalizability to external test cohorts with data collected at multiple sites. Through a proof-of-concept two-step classification workflow, we also demonstrated possible model translations to a clinical setting.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the promising and limiting aspects of using machine learning to predict tau-PET from scalable cost-effective variables, with findings relevant for clinical settings and future research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Accessible variables showed potential in estimating tau tangle load and distribution. Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were the best predictors of different tau-PET (positron emission tomography) composites. Machine learning models demonstrated high generalizability across AD cohorts.",Alzheimers Dement
40137847,Etomidate ameliorates Alzheimer-like neuropathology and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice.,"To investigate the effect and mechanism of etomidate on attenuating Alzheimer-like neuropathology and cognitive impairment in mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD was modeled in vivo using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice. After etomidate treatment, behavioral experiments and histopathological observation of hippocampus were performed. Hippocampal Aβ deposition was detected using immunofluorescence. AD was modeled in vitro using a HT22 cells which are an immortalized cell line derived from primary mouse hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ1-42. Cell viability, apoptosis rate and LDH release were detected after etomidate intervention. Synaptic proteins were detected by mmunofluorescence or Western blot, and neurotransmitters and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA. Etomidate improved the memory ability, novel object cognition ability, and spatial learning of APP/PS1 mice. The improvement of cognitive function and memory ability may be due to the recovery effect of etomidate on hippocampal pathological changes in APP/PS1 mice, including reducing Aβ deposition, neuron and synaptic loss. Etomidate also regulated neuroinflammation and the release of neurotransmitters GABA and 5-HT in APP/PS1 mice. Etomidate effectively reversed Aβ1-42-induced hippocampal neuronal damage, which was reflected in the improvement of cell viability and the inhibition of cytotoxicity, apoptosis and pro-inflammatory factors. Etomidate reversed the inhibition of the expression of synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) induced by Aβ1-42 in vitro. After etomidate intervention, the expression of serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1A) and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha1 (GABRA1) in Aβ1-42-injured HT22 cells were up-regulated, and free calcium ion was increased. In conclusion, etomidate ameliorates Alzheimer-like neuropathology and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, indicating that etomidate may be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of AD.",J Physiol Pharmacol

Therefore, maintaining low-dose, non-toxic extracellular glutamate concentrations between synapses to ensure the reliability of synaptic transmission is essential for maintaining normal physiological functions of neurons. More and more studies have confirmed that the specific pathogenesis of central nervous system diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease) caused by neuronal damage or death due to abnormal inter-synaptic glutamate concentration may be related to the abnormal function of excitatory amino acid transporter proteins and glutamine synthetase on astrocytes, and that the abnormal expression and function of the above two proteins may be related to the transcription, translation, and even modification of both by the process of transcription, translation, and even modification of astrocytes. oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses occurring in astrocytes during their transcription, translation and even modification.

40068133,Binding Sites of a PET Ligand in Tau Fibrils with the Alzheimer's Disease Fold from <sup>19</sup>F and <sup>13</sup>C Solid-State NMR.,"Aggregation of the tau protein into cross-β amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Developing small molecules that bind these tau fibrils is important for the diagnosis and treatment of tauopathies. Here, we report the binding sites of a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, PI-2620, to a recombinant tau construct that adopts the C-shaped AD fold. Using solid-state NMR <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>19</sup>F rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) experiments, we measured the proximity of protein residues to the fluorine atom of the ligand. These data indicate that PI-2620 binds at two main locations in the concave interior of the C-shaped structure. Molecular docking simulations constrained by these REDOR data identified five binding poses at these two locations. In addition, 2D <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>13</sup>C correlation NMR spectra indicate that PI-2620 decreased the intensities of residues at the protofilament interfaces, indicating that the ligand disordered the filament packing. Quantitative analysis of the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectra indicates that PI-2620 binds these AD-fold tau fibrils with a stoichiometry of ∼20 mol %, in which 10 mol % are immobilized and the rest are mobile. These results provide experimental constraints to the interaction of this second-generation PET tracer with tau fibrils adopting the AD fold and should be useful for the development of future imaging agents with improved stoichiometry and specificity for AD tau.",Biochemistry

In recent years, exosomes have garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic tool for neurodegenerative diseases. This study, for the first time, investigates the neuroprotective effects of exosomes derived from olfactory mucosa mesenchymal stem cells (OM-MSCs-Exos) in AD and further explore the potential role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in this process. Using an Aβ1-42-induced AD mouse model, we observed that OM-MSCs-Exos significantly improved cognitive function in behavioral tests, reduced neuroinflammatory responses, alleviated ER stress, and decreased neuronal apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that OM-MSCs-Exos exert neuroprotective effects by modulating the activation of microglia and astrocytes and influencing the ER stress response, a process that may involve LRP1. Although these findings support the potential neuroprotective effects of OM-MSCs-Exos, further studies are required to explore their long-term stability, dose dependency, and immunogenicity to assess their feasibility for clinical applications.",Biosci Trends
40114567,Oxidative Stress and the Role of Immune Cells in Alzheimer's Disease: Therapeutic Implications and Future Perspectives.,"The most common neurodegenerative illness and leading cause of death in the world is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is extremely expensive to treat. None of the AD treatments that are currently in the market with approval have any effect on disease progression. However, numerous clinical studies aimed at reducing amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque development, boosting Aβ clearance, or reducing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) failed or had conflicting results. As oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic neuroinflammation are implicated in numerous interconnected vicious cascades, research has revealed new therapeutic targets, including enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control, reducing oxidative stress, or modulating neuroinflammatory pathways. This review examines the role of oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and the interplay between peripheral and central immune systems in the pathogenesis of AD. We highlight how OS and immune dysregulation drive chronic neuroinflammation, exacerbating AD progression. Immune cells and inflammatory molecules emerge as critical players in disease pathology. Overall, this review concludes that targeting OS and immune system crosstalk represents promising therapeutic strategies for mitigating AD progression, providing a foundation for future interventions.",CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets

40133924,Dual modulation of amyloid beta and tau aggregation and dissociation in Alzheimer's disease: a comprehensive review of the characteristics and therapeutic strategies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not a single-cause disease; rather, it is a complex neurodegenerative disease involving multiple pathological pathways influenced by various risk factors. Aggregation and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau are the most prominent features in the brains of AD patients. Aggregated Aβ and tau exert neurotoxic effects in the central nervous system, contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of AD. They also act synergistically to cause neurodegeneration, resulting in memory loss. In this context, dual inhibition of Aβ and tau aggregation, or dissociation of these two aggregates, is considered promising for AD treatment. Recently, dual inhibitors capable of simultaneously targeting the aggregation and dissociation of both Aβ and tau have been investigated. Specific amino acid domains of Aβ and tau associated with their aggregation/dissociation have been identified. Subsequently, therapeutic agents that prevent aggregation or promote disaggregation by targeting these domains have been identified/developed. In this review, we summarize the major domains and properties involved in Aβ and tau aggregation, as well as the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of agents that simultaneously regulate their aggregation and dissociation. This comprehensive review may contribute to the design and discovery of next-generation dual-targeting drugs for Aβ and tau, potentially leading to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for AD.",Transl Neurodegener
40098380,Sleep Quality of Persons with Dementia and Family Caregivers in Korean Americans: Wearable Technology to Study the Dyadic Association.,"BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty in falling asleep and multiple awakenings at night, are prevalent among persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (hereafter dementia), resulting in advanced cognitive impairment and increased behavioral problems. Additionally, family caregivers (eg, spouses or offspring) suffer from reduced sleep quality as a result of sleep disturbances in the persons with dementia (PWDs) they care for. Relatively little is known about the interaction of sleep parameters in dyads (PWD-caregiver) as paired units among understudied immigrant minorities, particularly Korean Americans.
OBJECTIVES: To describe dyads' sleep parameters (ie, total/deep/rapid eye movement/light sleep, awake duration, latency duration, sleep efficiency) using wearable technology (smart-rings) and sleep diaries, and to identify interrelationships among sleep parameters between PWD and caregivers.
METHODS: This 4-week observational study used smart-ring monitoring, a sleep survey, and self-reported sleep diaries to explore sleep associations of Korean American dyads recruited from the community. Pearson correlations were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 11 dyads participated in the study. The mean age of PWD was 82.7 years (standard deviation (SD) = 2.3); of caregivers 69.1 years (SD = 10.2). Nine PWD (81.8%) were male, all caregivers (100%) were female, and 4 dyads (36.4%) slept in the same bed. Sleep parameters of PWD were significantly correlated with those of caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that PWD's sleep parameters (eg, deep sleep) were significantly correlated with those of caregivers' parameters. This study shows the feasibility of using wearable device to measure dyadic sleep quality for both PWD and their caregivers, particularly within immigrant populations.",West J Nurs Res
40167033,Serotonergic modulators in Alzheimer's disease: a hope in the hopeless condition.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide. AD is a progressive brain neurodegenerative disease due to genetic and environmental factors that induce a progressive accumulation of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein and extracellular amyloid protein (Aβ). However, anti-AD medications cannot reverse the fundamental AD neuropathology due to amyloid plaques and related oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. Thus, targeting other pathways might be reasonable in the management of AD particular in alleviation of AD neuropathology and related reactions. Serotonin (5HT) neurotransmitter plays a crucial role in preventing neurodegeneration and related oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. In addition, serotonergic system is highly dysregulated in many neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Deregulation of serotonin synthesis and its receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of AD . Therefore, this review we shall discuss how serotonergic system is affected in AD, and how 5HT modulators can reverse AD neuropathology and alleviate the associated neuropsychiatric disorders in AD patients.",Chem Biodivers

Growing evidence suggests that dietary polyphenols may reduce the risk and progression of AD through multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms. Polyphenols regulate amyloid proteostasis by inhibiting β/γ-secretase activity, preventing Aβ aggregation, and enhancing clearance pathways. Their strong antioxidant properties neutralize reactive oxygen species, chelate redox-active metals, and activate cytoprotective enzymes via Nrf2 signaling. This review examines the potential therapeutic targets, signaling pathways, and molecular mechanisms by which dietary polyphenols exert neuroprotective effects in AD, focusing on their roles in modulating amyloid proteostasis, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cerebrovascular health. Polyphenols mitigate neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-κB signaling and upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor, supporting neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. They also enhance cerebrovascular health by improving cerebral blood flow, maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity, and modulating angiogenesis. This review examines the molecular and cellular pathways through which polyphenols exert neuroprotective effects, focusing on their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and amyloid-modulating roles. We also discuss their influence on key AD pathologies, including Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Insights from clinical and preclinical studies highlight the potential of polyphenols in preventing or slowing AD progression. Future research should explore personalized dietary strategies that integrate genetic and lifestyle factors to optimize the neuroprotective effects of polyphenols.",Neurogenetics

Through its metabolic pathways, GPC acts as the precursor not only of choline and acetylcholine but also of various phospholipids. Extensive preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrates that GPC effectively alleviates cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, cerebral ischemia, stress, and epilepsy, among other conditions. Additionally, GPC has beneficial effects on such conditions and measures as ischemic/hypoxic conditions, ionizing radiation-induced damage, exercise performance, growth hormone release, and liver damage. As well as facilitating cholinergic neurotransmission, evidence also indicates GPC, among other activities, also can promote γ-aminobutyric acid release, enhance protein kinase C activity, facilitate hippocampal neurogenesis, upregulate neurotrophic factors, and inhibit inflammation. In preclinical studies, results indicate that GPC is not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo. Extensive human studies indicate GPC causes no severe adverse effects. Possible risks of atherosclerosis and stroke await necessary validation. In this review, the GPC-related metabolic pathways, pharmacological effects, mechanisms of action, and safety evaluation are discussed with the aim of providing a comprehensive understanding of GPC.",Nutr Rev

Behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) are neuropsychiatric signs accompanying dementia that carry a significant impact on prognosis and management. Management of BPSD is challenging because of its complex and multifactorial nature. Historically, no medications were specifically approved for the treatment of BPSD, and any pharmacological use was considered off-label. In May 2023, brexpiprazole was the first and only atypical antipsychotic agent to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia because of Alzheimer's disease. The purposes of this article are to discuss the clinical characteristics of brexpiprazole with a focus on safety and efficacy in older adults, to review the studies that led to the approval for agitation associated with dementia, and to examine its potential place in therapy and impact on patient care. Brexpiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic with affinity for multiple monoaminergic receptors. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia because of Alzheimer's disease was evaluated in two Phase III studies with results suggesting that brexpiprazole has potential to be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for this indication. Given the individualized and complicated nature of BPSD, brexpiprazole is another option in the treatment landscape that may improve symptoms of agitation but requires careful assessment to ensure benefits outweigh any risks.",Sr Care Pharm
40077014,Could Blood Transfusion Increase the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease? A Narrative Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease, and its pathogenesis is complex. In addition to amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau, inflammation and microbial infections also play a role in the development of AD. Currently, there is no effective clinical intervention to cure AD or completely halt its progression. Blood transfusion, a critical life-saving medical procedure widely employed in modern healthcare, faces growing demand due to global population aging. However, whether blood transfusion could increase the risk of AD is still not clear. Aβ and tau play major roles in the pathogenesis of AD and may possess the potential for transmission through blood transfusion. Iron overload and chronic inflammation, which can independently influence AD pathogenesis, may result from repeated transfusions. Additionally, herpesvirus, known to accelerate AD progression, can also be potentially transmitted by blood transfusion. In this study, recent advances in the associations between blood transfusion and the occurrence and development of AD were reviewed, and whether blood transfusion could increase the risk of AD was discussed. Furthermore, the related proposals for blood management and future research were advanced to provide references for the prevention and control of AD.",Healthcare (Basel)
40104076,Comparison of light gradient boosting and logistic regression for interactomic hub genes in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced periodontitis with Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema species have been found to invade the central nervous system through virulence factors, causing inflammation and influencing the host immune response. P. gingivalis interacts with astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, leading to neuroinflammation. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum may also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Interactomic hub genes, central to protein-protein interaction networks, are vulnerable to perturbations, leading to diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning can identify differentially expressed hub genes in specific conditions or diseases, providing insights into disease mechanisms and developing new therapeutic approaches. This study compares the performance of light gradient boosting and logistic regression in identifying interactomic hub genes in P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum-induced periodontitis with those in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Using the GSE222136 dataset, we analyzed differential gene expression in periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease. The GEO2R tool was used to identify differentially expressed genes under different conditions, providing insights into molecular mechanisms. Bioinformatics tools such as Cytoscape and CytoHubba were employed to create gene expression networks to identify hub genes. Logistic regression and light gradient boosting were used to predict interactomic hub genes, with outliers removed and machine learning algorithms applied.
RESULTS: The data were cross-validated and divided into training and testing segments. The top hub genes identified were TNFRSF9, LZIC, TNFRSF8, SLC45A1, GPR157, and SLC25A33, which are induced by P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum and are responsible for endothelial dysfunction in brain cells. The accuracy of logistic regression and light gradient boosting was 67% and 60%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: The logistic regression model demonstrated superior accuracy and balance compared to the light gradient boosting model, indicating its potential for future improvements in predicting hub genes in periodontal and Alzheimer's diseases.",Front Oral Health
40039355,Stochastic Graph Heat Modelling for Diffusion-based Connectivity Retrieval.,"Heat diffusion describes the process by which heat flows from areas with higher temperatures to ones with lower temperatures. This concept was previously adapted to graph structures, whereby heat flows between nodes of a graph depending on the graph topology. Here, we combine the graph heat equation with the stochastic heat equation, which ultimately yields a model for multivariate time signals on a graph. We show theoretically how the model can be used to directly compute the diffusion-based connectivity structure from multivariate signals. Unlike other connectivity measures, our heat model-based approach is inherently multivariate and yields an absolute scaling factor, namely the graph thermal diffusivity, which captures the extent of heat-like graph propagation in the data. On two datasets, we show how the graph thermal diffusivity can be used to characterise Alzheimer's disease (AD). We find that the graph thermal diffusivity is lower for AD patients than healthy controls and correlates with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, suggesting structural impairment in patients in line with previous findings.Clinical relevance- This study introduces a novel heat-based connectivity measure, which allows to characterise Alzheimer's disease in terms of the graph thermal diffusivity.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40023293,Mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and distinct neuropathological features. The absence of a definitive cure presents a significant challenge in neurology and neuroscience. Early clinical manifestations, such as memory retrieval deficits and apathy, underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the disease's underlying mechanisms. While amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles have dominated research efforts, accumulating evidence highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a central factor in AD pathogenesis. Mitochondria, essential cellular organelles responsible for energy production necessary for neuronal function become impaired in AD, triggering several cellular consequences. Factors such as oxidative stress, disturbances in energy metabolism, failures in the mitochondrial quality control system, and dysregulation of calcium release are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. These abnormalities are closely linked to the neurodegenerative processes driving AD development and progression. This review explores the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathogenesis, emphasizing its role in disease onset and progression, while also considering its potential as a biomarker and a therapeutic target.",Ageing Res Rev
39988568,Influence of cognitive impairment and race on plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in two diverse cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Factors influencing plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers remain incompletely understood. Here we evaluated Fujirebio plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in two diverse cohorts among whom 91% underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.
METHODS: Non-Hispanic White (NHW, n = 113), Black/African American (B/AA, n = 66), and Chinese American (ChA, n = 38) participants recruited from two universities were included. We examined if plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> correlated with CSF and clinical factors, differed between racial groups, and associated with novel CSF proteins.
RESULTS: CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> strongly correlated with CSF p-Tau<sub>217</sub> (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.912) which moderately correlated with plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.694). Plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> levels were higher with greater cognitive impairment but lower in B/AA than NHW participants even after adjusting for CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>. This resulted in greater positive predictive value for NHW than B/AA participants, and could be mediated by complement or lysosomal pathways.
DISCUSSION: Severity of cognitive impairment and race both influence plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> levels beyond race-associated differences in CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive impairment associates with plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> independent of CSF biomarkers. Black/African Americans had lower plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> than non-Hispanic White Americans. CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> could not explain lower plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in Black/African Americans.

The function of the glymphatic system is less active during waking but enhanced during sleep. The efficiency of the glymphatic system decreases with aging. Damage to the glymphatic system will give rise to the development and progression of many brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and vascular dementia (VaD).

40069789,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment of oral nicotinamide in the NEAT clinical trial for early Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide, a form of B3 vitamin, is an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor that reduces pTau<sub>231</sub> levels via histone deacetylase inhibition in murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent phase 2a randomized placebo-controlled trial tested high-dose oral nicotinamide for the treatment of early AD. While nicotinamide demonstrated good safety and tolerability, it did not significantly lower CSF pTau<sub>231</sub>, the primary biomarker endpoint of the study. Characterization of nicotinamide's pharmacokinetics and metabolites in the blood and CSF is needed.
METHODS: In these post hoc, blinded analyses of plasma and CSF samples from the completed two-site placebo controlled randomized trial testing of 1500 mg PO BID oral nicotinamide, we used mass spectroscopy to measure nicotinamide and its inactive metabolite 1-methyl-nicotinamide in plasma at baseline, 6, and 12 months and in CSF at baseline and 12 months from 23 participants on drug and 24 on placebo.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis found mean 12 month plasma nicotinamide increased &gt; 130-fold to 52 μM while mean methyl-nicotinamide increased &gt; 600-fold to 91 μM in individuals receiving nicotinamide compared to those receiving placebo, whose levels were unchanged from baseline. However, CSF nicotinamide was only measurable in 6 of the 19 available participants (32%) (mean increase of at least 147-fold to 18 μM). These CSF nicotinamide concentrations were 66% of their plasma levels, indicating good CNS bioavailability in only some participants. In contrast to CSF nicotinamide, more treated participants had higher CSF methyl-nicotinamide (n = 9, 43 μM), suggesting high-dosage nicotinamide was sufficient to pass the blood-brain barrier, but 13 of 19 were metabolically inactivated. Treatment favorably decreased mean pTau<sub>231</sub> levels by 34% in those six participants with elevated CSF levels of nicotinamide, compared to 3% elevation in participants who did not have elevated CSF nicotinamide, and a 3% decrease for placebo. No such relationships were observed for total tau, pTau<sub>181</sub>, or amyloid beta biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that oral administration markedly increased mean plasma nicotinamide levels, however CSF levels were below quantitation in a majority of participants and there was extensive metabolic inactivation to methyl-nicotinamide. Both the bioavailability and rapid metabolic methylation need to be addressed if nicotinamide is further developed as a potential intervention for AD.

40001197,25-Hydroxycholesterol modulates microglial function and exacerbates Alzheimer's disease pathology: mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential of cholesterol esterification inhibition.,"This study investigates the role of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a metabolite produced by cholesterol hydroxylase encoded by the Ch25h gene, in modulating microglial function and its potential implications in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. We demonstrated that 25HC impairs microglial surveillance, reduces phagocytic capacity, and increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo two-photon microscopy revealed that 25HC administration diminishes microglial response to brain lesions, while flow cytometry confirmed reduced phagocytosis in both in vivo and in vitro models. Additionally, amyloid-beta (Aβ) was shown to upregulate Ch25h expression and elevate 25HC levels in microglia, exacerbating these functional impairments. Mechanistically, 25HC was found to enhance cholesterol esterification, disrupt cell membrane dynamics, and further reduce microglial mobility and phagocytosis. Treatment with Avasimibe, a cholesterol esterification inhibitor, restored membrane dynamics and microglial function, leading to attenuated AD pathology in a 5XFAD mouse model. These findings suggest that 25HC-induced changes in microglial function contribute to AD progression, and targeting cholesterol metabolism could offer therapeutic potential.",J Neuroinflammation
40001463,Deletion of Murine APP Aggravates Tau and Amyloid Pathologies in the 5xFADXTg30 Alzheimer's Disease Model.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two key neuropathological lesions: amyloid plaques composed of amyloid β and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau. Amyloid β is produced through successive cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the amyloidogenic pathway. While increasing evidence suggests that APP plays critical roles in neuronal function and that its proteolytic derivative, sAPPα, has neurotrophic effects, the impact of APP deletion on both amyloid and tau pathologies remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a novel transgenic mouse model, 5xFAD×Tg30XAPP-/-, in which murine APP is deleted in the presence of both amyloid and tau pathologies. Using this innovative model, we demonstrate for the first time that deletion of APP exacerbates tau aggregation, amyloid deposition, and gliosis compared to control 5xFAD×Tg30 mice. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that APP deletion has profound and detrimental effects on both amyloid and tau pathologies in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the previously unappreciated role of APP in the regulation of these neurodegenerative processes.",Biomolecules

In this study, we extended our analysis to a series of pathologically confirmed cases of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) harboring different pathogenic mutations in MAPT, the gene encoding tau. We assessed the morphology, levels, and distribution of the mitophagy tag pS65-Ub in several affected brain regions and hippocampal subregions of these cases. While tau pathological burden was similarly increased across all FTDP-17 cases, pS65-Ub immunopositive signals were strongly accumulated in P301L cases and only weakly present in N279K cases. In the hippocampus of both mutation groups, the density of pS65-Ub positive cells was overall the greatest in the dentate gyrus followed by the subiculum, CA1, and CA2/3, with the CA4 showing only minimal presence. Notably, positive cells in the subiculum carried greater numbers and particularly vacuolar pS65-Ub structures, while cells in the dentate gyrus mostly contained fewer and rather granular pS65-Ub inclusions. Single cell analyses revealed differential co-localization of pS65-Ub with mitochondria, autophagosomes, and lysosomes in these two regions. Together, our study demonstrates distinct mitophagy alteration in different FTDP-17 MAPT cases and hint at selective organelle failure in the hippocampal subregions that was associated with the P301L mutation.",Acta Neuropathol Commun
40109001,HDAC11 displays neuropathological alterations and offers as a novel drug target for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive decline. Targeting histone deacetylase-11 (HDAC11) offers a novel therapeutic strategy due to its role in immune regulation.
METHODS: We conducted neuropathological analyses on human AD post mortem brain tissues and 5xFAD transgenic mice. We developed PB94, a brain-permeable HDAC11-selective inhibitor, and assessed its effects using live-animal imaging and behavioral studies.
RESULTS: HDAC11 was significantly upregulated in AD brains, correlating with amyloid pathology and neuroinflammatory markers. PB94 treatment reduced amyloid burden and neuroinflammation, improving cognitive function in 5xFAD mice.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight HDAC11 as a promising drug target for AD. PB94's ability to reduce amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation suggests its potential as an effective therapeutic. This study supports further exploration of HDAC11 inhibition as a treatment strategy for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Histone deacetylase-11 (HDAC11) is significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and colocalizes with amyloid pathology and neuroinflammatory markers. Novel brain-permeable HDAC11-selective inhibitor PB94 demonstrates promising therapeutic potential for AD treatment. PB94 treatment reduces amyloid burden and neuroinflammation in AD mouse models, confirmed by live imaging studies. HDAC11 inhibition enhances microglial phagocytosis of amyloid beta proteins and modulates inflammatory cytokine levels. PB94 treatment improves cognitive function in AD mouse models while showing favorable brain penetration and selectivity.",Alzheimers Dement
39988114,Integrating NLP and LLMs to discover biomarkers and mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and aberrant behaviour. It affects millions of people globally and is one of the main causes of dementia. The neurodegenerative condition known as AD has intricate, multifaceted mechanisms that make it difficult to comprehend and identify in its early stages. Conventional diagnostic techniques frequently fail to detect the disease in its early stages. By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), this research suggests a novel approach for identifying potential biomarkers and underlying mechanisms of AD. Clinical data is gathered from publicly accessible databases and healthcare facilities, including genetic information, neuroimaging scans, and medical records. The pre-processing of unstructured clinical notes involves tokenization and genetic profiles and neuroimaging data are normalized by Z-score normalization for consistency. Multi-Input Convolutional Neural Networks (MI-CNN) are employed to efficiently fuse diverse data sources, allowing for a thorough analysis. Key biomarkers linked to AD are identified and categorized using the Genetic Algorithm combined with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) (GenBERT). By fine-tuning BERT's hyperparameters using genetic optimization approaches, GenBERT enables the effective analysis of large medical datasets, such as patient histories, genetic data, and clinical notes. The combination strategy increases feature selection and the model's capacity to identify minute genomic and linguistic patterns suggestive of AD. The goal of this integrated strategy is to provide early diagnostic tools and new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease, which could transform methods for detecting and treating AD. As it concerns early AD prediction, the GenBERT model performs better than current techniques, obtaining the highest accuracy (98.30%) and F1-score (0.97), as well as greater precision (0.95) and recall (0.92). Additionally, it demonstrates its capacity to reliably identify both positive and negative AD cases with sensitivity (98.65%) and specificity (99.73%). Overall, GenBERT offers a trustworthy and useful tool for AD early diagnosis.",SLAS Technol
40012862,Study insights in the role of PGC-1α in neurological diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which is highly expressed in the central nervous system, is known to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biosynthesis, metabolic regulation, neuroinflammation, autophagy, and oxidative stress. This knowledge indicates a potential role of PGC-1α in a wide range of functions associated with neurological diseases. There is emerging evidence indicating a protective role of PGC-1α in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. As such, a deeper and broader understanding of PGC-1α and its role in neurological diseases is urgently needed. The present review provides a relatively complete overview of the current knowledge on PGC-1α, including its functions in different types of neurons, basic structural characteristics, and its interacting transcription factors. Furthermore, we present the role of PGC-1α in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other PolyQ diseases. Importantly, we discuss some compounds or drug-targeting strategies that have been studied to ameliorate the pathology of these neurological diseases and introduce the possible mechanistic pathways. Based on the available studies, we propose that targeting PGC-1α could serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for one or more neurological diseases.",Front Aging Neurosci
40054389,γ-Secretase modulation inhibits amyloid plaque formation and growth and stimulates plaque regression in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 mice.,"γ-Secretase modulators (GSMs) represent an emerging oral therapy for preventing and targeting Aβ-amyloidosis in Alzheimer disease. Aβ is a family of peptides of varying lengths where both the total and relative amounts of the individual Aβ peptides affect the process of amyloidosis. In contrast to inhibitors of Aβ synthesis, GSMs do not affect the total amount of Aβ peptides generated but decrease longer more amyloidogenic Aβ species while increasing the production of shorter less amyloidogenic Aβ peptides. In this study, we investigated how this modulation of Aβ production affects Aβ plaque dynamics in the brains of APP/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Similar to studies with different inhibitors of Aβ synthesis, we found that 28 days of once-daily oral treatment with the GSM AZ4126 (100 μmol/kg) resulted in a strong reduction in plaque formation and plaque growth. In addition, and in contrast to Aβ production inhibitors, the GSM AZ4126 caused a significant reduction in the size of established Aβ plaques. Moreover, the antiamyloidogenic activity was accompanied by a marked reduction in brain interstitial fluid Aβ40 and Aβ42 and an increase in Aβ37. Treatment of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons with the GSM AZ4126 reduced secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 dose-dependently and with a complementary increase in Aβ37 and Aβ38. These studies unravel a previously unknown antiamyloidogenic effect of GSMs, suggesting that they promote the clearance of already established Aβ pathology in addition to their inhibition of Aβ amyloid formation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Immunotherapies promoting Aβ-amyloid clearance have shown efficacy in early Alzheimer disease, but complementary Aβ targeting therapeutic approaches are needed. γ-Secretase modulators (GSMs) target Aβ production with an effective and tolerable mechanism. This study demonstrates that a GSM not only inhibits Aβ-amyloid formation but also promotes Aβ-plaque clearance in experiments conducted in an Aβ-amyloidosis mouse model and supports further development of GSMs as an effective oral treatment for Alzheimer disease.",J Pharmacol Exp Ther
40042065,Rosa Roxburghii Tratt Polysaccharides Prevent Alzheimer's Disease-Like Cognitive Dysfunctions and Pathology in Rats by Regulating the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Oxidative Stress.,"The microbial-gut-brain axis and oxidative stress may be important to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rosa roxburghii Tratt polysaccharides (RRTP) have a strong antioxidant effect and can affect the gut microbiota, and whether it can affect AD is unknown. So, AlCl<sub>3</sub> and d-galactose were used to establish AD model rats, and RRTP was used as an intervention treatment. Morris water maze test was used to detect cognitive functions. The hippocampus was used to observe the pathological changes, and the cortex was used to measure antioxidant markers. The stool was collected for 16S rDNA sequencing. Morris water maze test showed that the learning ability and memory level of AD group rats were decreased, and RRTP intervention could mitigate the injury to a certain extent. In the AD group, hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed changes in the morphology of neurons, silver glycine staining revealed neurofibrillary tangles and Congo red staining revealed β-amyloid. RRTP could ameliorate the above changes to some extent. The results of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and glutathione peroxidase showed that the antioxidant capacity in the RRTP intervention group was significantly higher than that in the AD group. 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that there were differences in the species composition of gut microbiota, and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in the AD group was decreased. After RRTP intervention, the proportion of Lactobacillus increased. In conclusion, RRTP may prevent AD pathology and cognitive functions in rats to a certain extent through the microbiota-gut-brain axis and oxidative stress.",J Med Food
40034740,Ketogenic diet and microRNAs: focus on cognitive function.,"Cognition is a mental process of understanding and learning driven by memory. Recent advances in molecular biology and neuroscience have revealed a fascinating interplay between cognitive function and microRNAs (miRNAs). The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and adequate-protein diet that triggers the synthesis of ketone bodies, establishing ketosis. Recent and accumulating studies on human and animal models have shown that the KD benefits neurodegenerative diseases, where cognition is affected. The KD can also modulate miRNAs, molecules that are dysregulated in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, where cognition is lost. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the function of miRNAs in neurodevelopment and cognition. We also explore how the KD in human studies can enhance cognitive function and highlight the protective role of microRNAs in neurological conditions.",Front Nutr
40064364,Microbial infection instigates tau-related pathology in Alzheimer's disease via activating neuroimmune cGAS-STING pathway.,"Microbial infection, the strong trigger to directly induce inflammation in brain, is long considered a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how these infections contribute to neurodegeneration remains underexplored. To examine the effect of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection on tauopathy in local hippocampus of P301S mice, we utilized a modified HSV-1 strain (mHSV-1) potentially relevant to AD, we found that its infection promotes tau-related pathology in part via activating neuroimmune cGAS-STING pathway in the tau mouse model. Specifically, Sting ablation causes the detectable improvement of neuronal dysfunction and loss in P301S mice, which is causally linked to lowered proinflammatory status in the brain. Administration of STING inhibitor H-151 alleviates neuroinflammation and tau-related pathology in P301S mice. These results jointly suggest that herpesviral infection, as the vital environmental risk factor, could induce tau-related pathology in AD pathogenesis partially via neuroinflammatory cGAS-STING pathway.",Neuroscience
40116653,"Associations among diurnal cortisol, melatonin, and agitation in people living with cognitive impairment.","BackgroundWhile the underlying mechanisms of agitation are not fully understood in people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, research suggests that dysregulated neuroendocrine processes, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may play a role.ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the associations between salivary cortisol, melatonin at baseline, and agitation both at baseline and at post-intervention.MethodsThis study was a secondary analysis of a two-group, randomized, parallel designed clinical trial of 210 people living with cognitive impairment. Agitation, salivary cortisol, and salivary melatonin were measured at baseline and four weeks. Salivary cortisol and melatonin indicators were generated through three timepoints of cortisol and melatonin collection across the two consecutive days. Presence of agitation was measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Logistic regressions were conducted to achieve the aim.ResultsA significant association was found at baseline between diurnal cortisol slope and agitation (OR = 0.03, p = 0.029), there were no relationships between all other cortisol or melatonin indicators with agitation. Cortisol awaking response (OR = 0.16, p = 0.048), its percentage (OR = 0.27, p = 0.021) and its increase higher than 50% (OR = 0.09, p = 0.009), were significant with agitation at four weeks.ConclusionsGiven the potential link between cortisol and agitation, exploring cortisol-lowering interventions like minimizing environmental stressors, smoothing transitions to different situations, stress-reduction techniques, and behavioral therapies may aid in managing agitation in older adults with cognitive impairment.",J Alzheimers Dis
40024051,Phytocompounds of Senecio candicans as potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors targeting Alzheimer's disease: A structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation study.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline due to the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and decreased acetylcholine levels caused by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Current treatments using synthetic acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) provide only symptomatic relief and are associated with adverse effects, highlighting the need for safer and more effective alternatives. This study investigates the potential of phytoconstituents from the plant Senecio candicans as natural AChE inhibitors for AD treatment. Using structure-based virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluated several compounds from Senecio candicans for their binding affinity, stability, and inhibitory activity against AChE. The findings identified compounds such as Estra-135(10)-trien-17β-ol and Vulgarone A, which demonstrated strong binding affinities and stable interactions with AChE, comparable to or surpassing the clinically used drug Donepezil. These phytoconstituents exhibited potential as effective AChEIs with potentially fewer side effects. The results underscore the therapeutic potential of plant-based molecules for drug discovery, offering a promising avenue for developing new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Combining phytochemical studies with computational methods provides a powerful approach to identifying novel therapeutic agents. This study suggests that phytoconstituents from Senecio candicans could serve as safer alternatives for managing AD. Further experimental validation and clinical studies are necessary to confirm these compounds' efficacy and safety, paving the way for innovative, plant-derived treatments for Alzheimer's disease.",Comput Biol Chem
39999409,Discovery of New Pentapeptide Inhibitors Against Amyloid-β Aggregation Using Word2Vec and Molecular Simulation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides into toxic oligomers and fibrils. The efficacy of existing peptide inhibitors based on the central hydrophobic core (CHC) sequence of Aβ42 remains limited due to self-aggregation or poor inhibition. This study aimed to identify novel pentapeptide inhibitors with high similarity and low binding energy to the CHC region LVFFA using a new computational screening workflow based on Word2Vec and molecular simulation. The antimicrobial peptides and human brain protein sequences were used for training the Word2Vec model. After tuning the parameters of the Word2Vec model, 1017 pentapeptides with high similarity to LVFFA were identified. Molecular docking was employed to estimate the affinity of the pentapeptides for the target of Aβ14-42 pentamer, and 103 peptides with favorable docking scores were obtained. Finally, five pentapeptides with a low binding energy and high binding stability via molecular dynamics simulation were experimentally validated using thioflavin T assays. Surprisingly, one pentapeptide, i.e., PALIR, exhibited significant inhibition surpassing the positive control LPFFN. This study demonstrates an effective combinatorial strategy to discover new peptide inhibitors. With PALIR representing a promising lead candidate, further optimization of PALIR could aid in the development of improved therapies to prevent amyloid toxicity in AD.",ACS Chem Neurosci

40095345,Exosomes as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Agents in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Future Directions.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS rank among the most challenging global health issues, marked by substantial obstacles in early diagnosis and effective treatment. Current diagnostic techniques frequently demonstrate inadequate sensitivity and specificity, whilst conventional treatment strategies encounter challenges related to restricted bioavailability and insufficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Recently, exosomes-nanoscale vesicles packed with proteins, RNAs, and lipids-have emerged as promising agents with the potential to reshape diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these diseases. Unlike conventional drug carriers, they naturally traverse the BBB and can deliver bioactive molecules to affected neural cells. Their molecular cargo can influence cell signaling, reduce neuroinflammation, and potentially slow neurodegenerative progression. Moreover, exosomes serve as non-invasive biomarkers, enabling early and precise diagnosis while allowing real-time disease monitoring. Additionally, engineered exosomes, loaded with therapeutic molecules, enhance this capability by targeting diseased neurons and overcoming conventional treatment barriers. By offering enhanced specificity, reduced immunogenicity, and an ability to bypass physiological limitations, exosome-based strategies present a transformative advantage over existing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This review examines the multifaceted role of exosomes in NDDs, emphasizing their diagnostic capabilities, intrinsic therapeutic functions, and transformative potential as advanced treatment vehicles.",Mol Neurobiol
40014770,The historical and projected prevalence of dysphagia in Aotearoa New Zealand.,"AIM: To estimate the current prevalence of dysphagia in the Aotearoa New Zealand population and to project its prevalence to 2073.
METHODS: The current prevalence of dysphagia in Aotearoa New Zealand is computed from the prevalences of the aetiologies of dysphagia combined with the rates at which the aetiologies result in dysphagia. Projected dysphagia rates use autoregressive integrated moving average forecasting techniques combined with population projections from Statistics New Zealand and estimates of current and past prevalence rates of dysphagia.
RESULTS: The prevalence of dysphagia in Aotearoa New Zealand is estimated to have been approximately 1.78% in 2020, with the biggest aetiological contributors being stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. These three causes made up 81.5% of all estimated dysphagia cases in 2019. The prevalence rate of dysphagia in Aotearoa New Zealand is projected to rise to 2.54%, reflecting the ageing population.
CONCLUSION: An increased prevalence of dysphagia will result in an increased healthcare burden, both from resources spent on treating dysphagia and complications stemming from undiagnosed and thus untreated dysphagia. Estimating the full extent of this increased burden is hampered by the absence of systematic, extensive and reliable records available relating to cases of dysphagia in Aotearoa New Zealand.",N Z Med J
39988952,Evaluation of two plasma-based proteotyping assays against APOE ε4 genotyping in a memory clinic setting: The Gothenburg H70 Clinical Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele status is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and should be determined prior to initiation of anti-amyloid beta antibody treatment, because of increased risk of treatment-related side effects. Plasma-based apoE4 proteotyping may be an alternative to genotyping, with limited clinical evidence.
METHODS: apoE4 proteotyping was performed on 164 memory-clinic patients, using one chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and one nucleic acid-linked immunosandwich assay (NULISA). The assays were evaluated against APOE ε4 blood genotyping.
RESULTS: The CLEIA had a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify APOE ε4 homozygosity and carriership in relation to genotyping. The NULISA had a 92.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity to classify homozygosity and a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify carriership.
DISCUSSION: The high performance suggests that the assays may be used as an easily available tool for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step approach.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma-based proteotyping presented good to excellent sensitivity in identifying apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 homozygosity. The negative predictive value was also very good to excellent, allowing us to rule out APOE ε4 homozygosity with high precision. Assays with excellent precision show potential for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step approach.",Alzheimers Dement
40111670,Vaccines for Alzheimer's disease: a brief scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia among older adults. Existing treatments-such as cholinesterase inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid beta-can improve functional and neuropsychiatric outcomes but fail to prevent disease onset, halt progression, or adequately reduce amyloid-beta burden. Consequently, research efforts have shifted to primary prevention through immunization, although the efficacy of these strategies remains uncertain. This review explores the efficacy, safety, and adverse events of current immunotherapies for AD and discusses future research and clinical implications.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-SR) checklist. A systematic search was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science.
RESULTS: A total of 145 studies were included. Preclinical research often employed transgenic mouse models to investigate AD pathology and vaccine benefits, while Phase I and II clinical trials centered on safety and preliminary efficacy in humans. Most studies were conducted in the USA, China, and Japan, highlighting these countries' strong clinical trial infrastructure. Vaccination frequently reduced amyloid-beta or tau pathology in preclinical settings, although cognitive outcomes were inconsistent. Clinical trials primarily focused on safety and immune response, with newer vaccines such as ABvac40 demonstrating encouraging results and minimal adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Although AD vaccines show promise in preclinical settings, longer and more comprehensive clinical trials are necessary to determine their long-term efficacy and safety. Standardized protocols and efforts to reduce regional disparities in research would facilitate better comparability and generalizability of findings, thereby guiding the future development of effective immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease.",Neurol Sci

Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and Casein Kinase-1δ (CK-1δ) have gained a lot of attention for its role in tau pathology. Utilizing a multitarget strategy, a series of 6-amino pyridine derivatives were developed as promising dual GSK-3β/CK-1δ inhibitors for the treatment of AD. This study involved the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel 6-amino pyridine derivatives as dual GSK-3β/CK-1δ inhibitors exhibiting excellent biological activities. The in-vitro results indicated that most of compounds displayed promising activity against GSK-3β/CK-1δ. Among the tested compounds, 8d exhibited strong inhibitory activity against GSK-3β and CK-1δ, with IC₅₀ values of 0.77 ± 0.01 μM and 0.57 ± 0.12 μM, respectively. Notably, compound 8d significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylated aggregates while demonstrating safety in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. ADME prediction results indicated that compound 8d adhered to Lipinski's rule of five and exhibited potential to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Molecular docking analysis revealed that this compound fits well within the ATP binding site, forming hydrogen bonds between its 6-amino pyridine ring with key amino acids, including Asp133 and Val135 in the hinge region of GSK-3β, as well as Leu85 of CK-1δ. These findings indicate that 6-amino pyridine derivatives have the potential to be effective dual-target candidates for AD.",Bioorg Chem
40040908,A comparative study of methods for dynamic survival analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Dynamic survival analysis has become an effective approach for predicting time-to-event outcomes based on longitudinal data in neurology, cognitive health, and other health-related domains. With advancements in machine learning, several new methods have been introduced, often using a two-stage approach: first extracting features from longitudinal trajectories and then using these to predict survival probabilities.
METHODS: This work compares several combinations of longitudinal and survival models, assessing their predictive performance across different training strategies. Using synthetic and real-world cognitive health data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we explore the strengths and limitations of each model.
RESULTS: Among the considered survival models, the Random Survival Forest consistently delivered strong results across different datasets, longitudinal models, and training strategies. On the ADNI dataset the best performing method was Random Survival Forest with the last visit benchmark and super landmarking with an average tdAUC of 0.96 and brier score of 0.07. Several other methods, including Cox Proportional Hazards and the Recurrent Neural Network, achieve similar scores. While the tested longitudinal models often struggled to outperform simple benchmarks, neural network models showed some improvement in simulated scenarios with sufficiently informative longitudinal trajectories.
DISCUSSION: Our findings underscore the importance of aligning model selection and training strategies with the specific characteristics of the data and the target application, providing valuable insights that can inform future developments in dynamic survival analysis.",Front Neurol

39996987,Electrochemical Technology for the Detection of Tau Proteins as a Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease in Blood.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and a significant cause of dementia in elderly individuals, with a growing prevalence in our aging population. Extracellular amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), intracellular tau proteins, and their phosphorylated forms have gained prominence as critical biomarkers for early and precise diagnosis of AD, correlating with disease progression and response to therapy. The high costs and invasiveness of conventional diagnostic methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), limit their suitability for large-scale or routine screening. However, electrochemical (EC) analysis methods have made significant progress in disease detection due to their high sensitivity, excellent specificity, portability, and cost-effectiveness. This article reviews the progress in EC biosensing technologies, focusing on the detection of tau protein biomarkers in the blood (a low-invasive, accessible diagnostic medium). The article then discusses various EC sensing platforms, including their fabrication processes, limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, and clinical potential to show the role of these sensors as transformers changing the face of AD diagnostics.",Biosensors (Basel)
40057463,Distinct trajectories of subjective cognitive decline before diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders: Longitudinal modelling over 18 years.,"BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an established predictor of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) (i.e. mild cognitive impairment and dementia). Yet, its construct remains contentious. Many individuals with SCD do not progress to NCD, leading to an alternative term in the literature - 'functional cognitive disorders' - to describe the SCD experience in these individuals.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the distinct differences in trajectories of SCD between those who did and did not eventually develop NCD.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Centers across USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,167 participants aged ≥50 years were followed up near-annually to evaluate for SCD and NCD (median follow-up=8.1 years; range=1.0-18.0). Cases were defined as those who developed incident NCD during follow-up; controls completed ≥10 years of follow-up and had normal cognition throughout follow-up period.
MEASUREMENTS: SCD was evaluated with a yes/no question based on ""perceived decline in memory relative to previously attained abilities"". The trajectories of SCD were modelled with mixed-effect logistic regression, using a backward timescale.
RESULTS: Those who developed NCD (cases) had new onset of SCD within past 20 years, which became particularly noticeable 13-14 years before diagnosis, and became even more evident in the last 4 years. Those who did not develop NCD (controls) reported SCD since younger age, with the probability of SCD remaining constant over time. The distinctive trajectories were consistent across Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's disease, and among those with higher baseline rates of SCD due to psychiatric conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: SCD exhibits distinctive trajectories among those who do and do not progress to NCD. These distinctive trajectories can inform NCD risk for early interventions, and guide public health messaging to distinguish high-risk SCD from normal ageing. Future SCD scales may possibly need to evaluate symptom changes over a longer, 20-year horizon to better capture the new onset of SCD within this longer timeframe.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis

In particular, many studies pointed out the potential neuroprotective effect of polyphenols-rich extracts from plants. Evidence indeed highlights the action of polyphenols, both as antioxidants and as inhibitors in the formation of amyloid protein aggregates, known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, aqueous extracts obtained at high and room temperature from leaves of Moringa oleifera (MO) harvested in Sicily were characterized for polyphenolic content, anti-oxidative and free radical scavenging capacity. UHPLC-HESI-MS analysis shows that both water extracts are rich in terms of polyphenols. Then, MO aqueous extracts were tested as inhibitors in the amyloid aggregation process of Amyloid β-peptide 1-42 (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>). This peptide is strongly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), its overproduction and aggregated species being considered a hallmark of AD. Results show that MO extracts cause a strong inhibition on the amyloid process. Biophysical characterization of the extracts reveals the presence of stable polyphenol assemblies. Both free and aggregated polyphenols elicit an efficient inhibition mechanism held up by their ability to interact with metastable species, strongly hindering autocatalytic amyloid growth. Finally, the effects of the MO room temperature extract have been tested on an AD cell model, retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells challenged with glyceraldehyde (GA). Cell pretreatment with MO extract results in an improved cell viability in comparison with the control and furthermore in the reduction of both mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and GA-stimulated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> production.",Food Sci Nutr

40047257,Genetic and pharmacologic enhancement of SUMO2 conjugation prevents and reverses cognitive impairment and synaptotoxicity in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta oligomers (Aβos) are toxic to synapses and key to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid pathology, representing a target for therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: Amyloid and small ubiquitin modifier 2 (SUMO2) transgenics were analyzed by electrophysiology and behavioral testing. A recombinant analogue of SUMO2, SBT02, was generated and assessed for brain penetration and the ability to mitigate amyloid pathology.
RESULTS: Elevated SUMO2 expression prevents cognitive and synaptic impairment in a mouse model of AD amyloid pathology. Systemic administration of SBT02 resulted in high brain bioavailability and prophylactically halted the progression of AD-associated deficits. SBT02 also restored cognition and synaptic function in late-stage amyloid load. Mechanistically, SUMO2 and SBT02 do not alter amyloid processing or clearance and mitigate synaptotoxicity in the presence of high amyloid loads.
DISCUSSION: SBT02 is a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract and reverse the toxic effects of Aβos in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Genetic overexpression of human SUMO2 prevents the long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments and cognitive deficits in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenics without affecting amyloid pathology. A recombinant analogue of human SUMO2, termed SBT02, when administered systemically, displays high brain bioavailability and has no adverse effects at high doses. Prophylactic treatment of APP transgenics with SBT02 prior to the development of amyloid pathology results in the prevention of synaptic and behavioral dysfunction. SBT02 also reverses pre-existing LTP and cognitive impairments when administered to APP transgenics with advanced and severe pathology. SBT02 has no impact on amyloid pathology, indicating a mechanism of action on synaptic resistance to Aβ toxicity.",Alzheimers Dement
40083218,Early signs of neuron autonomous and non-autonomous hyperexcitability in locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons of a mouse model of tauopathy and Alzheimer's disease.,"AIM: The locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the earliest brain regions affected by phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using the P301S mouse model, we investigated the temporal progression of tau pathology and its functional consequences.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to assess p-tau deposition in LC noradrenergic neurons at 2-3 and 5-6 months. Electrophysiological recordings evaluated neuronal hyperexcitability, measuring membrane potential, rheobase, and spontaneous action potential (AP) frequency in P301S and wild-type (WT) mice. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) was used to measure norepinephrine (NE) release. GABA(A) receptor subunit expression was analyzed via immunoblotting.
RESULTS: P-tau was detected in LC neurons as early as 2-3 months, with a rostral-to-caudal gradient, and by 5-6 months, nearly all LC neurons exhibited p-tau immunoreactivity. P301S neurons showed hyperexcitability, characterized by depolarized membrane potentials, a more negative rheobase, and increased spontaneous AP frequency. Synaptic blockade elicited a reduced increase in AP frequency, suggesting diminished inhibitory tone. GABA(A) α2 subunit expression significantly declined with age in P301S mice, whereas α3 remained unchanged. FSCV showed significantly elevated NE release in P301S mice at 3 and 6 months compared to WT.
CONCLUSION: The findings highlight early LC dysfunction in tauopathies, characterized by increased excitability, reduced inhibitory tone, and exaggerated NE release. This hyperactivity may contribute to excitotoxicity and downstream dysfunction in LC-regulated brain regions. Targeting LC hyperactivity and restoring inhibitory signaling could be promising therapeutic strategies for mitigating AD progression.",Acta Physiol (Oxf)

39978567,Tg-SwDI transgenic mice: A suitable model for Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy basic research and preclinical studies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent cause of dementia. Characteristic features observed in the brain of AD patients are the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) aggregates, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, neuronal and synaptic loss, and elevated levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is another common cause of cognitive decline characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the cerebral vasculature. The precise overlapping pathogenic mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of AD and CAA are not very well understood. However, vascular dysfunction observed at early stages is considered a key phenomenon. Tg-SwDI transgenic mice expressing human Aβ precursor protein (AβPP) harboring the Swedish K670N/M671L and vasculotropic Dutch/Iowa E693Q/D694N mutations in the brain have been extensively used to study many pathological features observed in AD/CAA patients and to design biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. The present review summarizes studies addressing different features mimicking human disease in Tg-SwDI mice: parenchymal and cerebral vascular amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation, complement overactivation, cerebrovascular, mitochondrial and GABAergic system dysfunction, altered NO synthesis, circadian rhythm disruptions, lead exposure effect, among others. Also, reports that evaluated anti-Aβ and anti-inflammatory strategies and compounds capable of delaying or reversing vascular dysfunction and the impairment of GABAergic transmission in Tg-SwDI mice are analyzed. This review may help researchers determine this model's appropriateness for future studies of a particular mechanism or a novel treatment protocol.",Exp Neurol
40108822,"Towards Clinical Diagnoses: Classifying Alzheimer's Disease Using Single fMRI, Small Datasets, and Transfer Learning.","PURPOSE: Deep learning and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are two unique methodologies that can be combined to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple studies have harnessed these methods to diagnose AD with high accuracy. However, there are difficulties in adapting this research to real-world diagnoses. For example, the two key issues of data availability and model usability limit clinical applications. These two areas are concerned with problems of accessibility, generalizability, and methodology that may limit model adoption. For example, fMRI deep learning models require a large amount of training data, which is not widely available. Contemporary models are also not typically formatted for clinical data or created for use by non-specialized populations. In this study, we develop a deep-learning fMRI pipeline that addresses some of these issues.
METHOD: We use transfer learning to address problems with data availability. We also use semi-automated and single-image techniques (i.e., one fMRI volume per participant) to make a model that is usable for non-specialized populations. Our model was initially trained on 524 participants from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE; Autism and controls). Our model was then transferred and fine-tuned to a small sample of 64 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; AD and controls).
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: This transfer learning model achieved an AD classification accuracy of 77% and outperformed the same model without transfer learning by approximately 30%. Accordingly, our model showed that small AD samples can be accurately classified in a clinically friendly manner.",Brain Behav
40094208,Identification and Characterization of the Structure and Size of Aβ42 Oligomers Targeting the Receptor FcγRIIb.,"Kam and colleagues discovered that FcγRIIb can specifically bind to Aβ42 oligomers (AβOs). The N-terminal residues F4 and D7 of Aβ42, as well as the W115 residue in domain D2 of FcγRIIb, are involved in this binding. However, the specificity of the FcγRIIb receptor's binding sites for AβOs and their dependence on different AβO species, including dimers (D/D<sub>T</sub>), trimers (T/T<sub>T</sub>), tetramers (Te/Te<sub>T</sub>), and pentamers (P/P<sub>T</sub>) during both the primary (P1) and secondary nucleation phases (P2), remains unknown. To address this, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the interactions between the extracellular domains D1 and D2 (FDD) of FcγRIIb and AβOs of varying sizes in the two different phases. We discovered that three specific fragments (f1, f2, and f3) of domain D2 in FDD are the primary binding sites for AβO species. Furthermore, among AβOs of the same molecular weight, those from the P2 phase exhibit a stronger binding affinity for FDD than those from the P1 phase. The distinction is ascribed to the stronger dependence on the hydrophobic residues in the β1 and β2 regions for the binding of AβOs in P2 (including T<sub>T</sub>, Te<sub>T</sub>, and P<sub>T</sub>) than that (including D, Te, and P) in the P1 phase. In the P1 phase, these AβOs prefer to achieve binding to FDD through their N-terminal residues; however, by this, we identified that the species observed in Kam's experiment to bind FcγRIIb should probably be the tetrameric AβO (Te) in the P1 phase. Moreover, within both the P1 and P2 phases, we predicted that the trimeric AβO species in either the P1 or P2 phase is the strongest binding ligand for the FcγRIIb receptor. This study provides a comprehensive molecular perspective on the interaction between FcγRIIb and AβO in P2, which is of significant importance for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autoimmune diseases.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40030424,A Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network Extracting Local and Global Contextual Features for the Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Structural MRI.,"Recent advancements in the classification of Alzheimer's disease have leveraged the automatic feature generation capability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using neuroimaging biomarkers. However, most of the existing CNN-based methods often disregard the local features of the brain data, which leads to a loss of subtle fine-grained features in the brain imaging data. Moreover, the existing CNN architectures, which mainly rely on global features, do not pay much attention to the discriminability of the extracted features for the task of classification of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the existing architectures often end up using a large number of parameters to enhance the richness of the extracted features. This paper proposes a novel lightweight deep CNN, which extracts local and global contextual features from the sagittal slices of structural MRI data and uses both of these two types of features for the classification of the disease. The main idea used in designing the proposed network is to process separately the local and global features by using modules that pay a special attention to extract local and global contextual features. The fused local and global contextual features are then used for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. The proposed network is tested for the binary and multiclass classifications of the disease using the MR images taken from the ADNI database. The proposed network is shown to provide a performance that is significantly higher than that provided by other existing state-of-the-art networks, yet using a number of parameters that is a small fraction of that used by the other schemes.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40026711,Age-related behavioural abnormalities in C57BL/6.KOR-Apoe <sup>shl</sup> mice.,"Spontaneously hyperlipidaemic (Apoe<sup>shl</sup>) mice were discovered in 1999 as mice lacking apolipoprotein E (ApoE) owing to a mutation in the Apoe gene. However, age-related behavioural changes in commercially available Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice have not yet been clarified. The behavioural abnormalities of ApoE-deficient mice, which are genetically modified mice artificially deficient in ApoE, have been investigated in detail, and it has been reported that they can serve as a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To understand whether Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice can also serve as a murine model of AD, it is necessary to investigate age-related behavioural abnormalities in Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice. In this study, we conducted a series of behavioural experiments on 7- and 11-month-old Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice to investigate the behavioural abnormalities associated with ageing in Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice. In this study, 7-month-old Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice showed decreased body weight and grip strength compared to age-matched wild-type mice. In the open field test, 7-month-old Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice showed increased anxiety-like behaviour compared to wild-type mice, whereas 11-month-old Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice showed decreased anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice aged 7 and 11 months had increased serum cholesterol levels. These results indicate that the behaviour of Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice changes with age. However, 11-month-old Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice did not show a decline in cognitive function or memory ability similar to murine models of AD. Our findings indicate that Apoe<sup>shl</sup> mice can be used to investigate the function of ApoE in the central nervous system.",Transl Neurosci
40125852,Concentration-Based Analysis of Metal-Induced Tau Fibrillar versus non-fibrillar Aggregation: Implications for Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Tau protein aggregation is the most significant factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the accumulation of metal ions in the brain is considered a key factor in the development of this disease. Tau protein exhibits two distinct aggregate structures: fibrillar and non-fibrillar aggregates. In this study, we conducted the first detailed study of the interactions of tau protein with three different concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>3+</sup>ions. Our findings demonstrate that low concentrations (0.01 mM) of these metal ions promote tau fibrillation, while higher concentrations (1 mM) induce non-fibrillar aggregates. We have investigated the structural changes of tau by using advanced techniques such as SDS-PAGE, DTNB, AFM, CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. At low concentrations, Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions produced shorter fibrils, whereas Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions resulted in longer fibrils. CD showed increased β-sheet structures with a decrease in random coil content. Interestingly, Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions caused a significant decrease in neuronal viability. Our data highlights a new approach that illuminates the different ways in which the metal ions distinctively cause tau fibrillar versus non-fibrillar aggregates, linked to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.",ChemistryOpen
40048348,Unobtrusive Sleep Health Assessment Using Impulse Radar: A Pilot Study in Older People.,"OBJECTIVE: Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar technology has emerged as a promising alternative for creating portable and cost-effective in-home monitoring devices. Although there exists good evidence supporting its effectiveness in sleep monitoring, previous studies predominantly focus on younger, healthy participants. This research evaluates the applicability of commercial impulse UWB radar for sleep monitoring in older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs).
METHODS: 47 older people (mean age: 71.2 6.5, 18 with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease) participated in our overnight sleep trial with polysomnography (PSG) and UWB radar monitoring. Data processing based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) was employed to reconstruct cardiopulmonary activity and limb movements from radar signals. 29 features were extracted from the radar signals, and sleep stages were classified using a sequence-to-sequence neural network. Additionally, a cross-entropy-based approach was used to quantify uncertainties in the radar classification model and provide confidence in the classification.
RESULTS: The UWB radar system demonstrated high accuracy in detecting body movements, reconstructing respiratory patterns, and monitoring heart rate. For sleep stage classification, the results showed a Kappa coefficient of 0.63 and an average accuracy of 74.4% across wake, REM sleep, light sleep (N1 + N2), and deep sleep (N3) categories.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method reliably monitors physiological changes during sleep, which suggests its potential as a cost-effective alternative to traditional sleep monitoring devices.
SIGNIFICANCE: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.",IEEE Trans Biomed Eng
40011174,Patient eligibility for amyloid-targeting immunotherapies in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Aβ) targeting immunotherapies have evolved as promising treatment options for patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding how eligibilty criteria impact on the number of patients potentially qualifying for treatment is of high relevance for designing diagnostic workflows in clinical practice and for estimating required ressources and costs.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed at estimating the number of potentially eligible patients for treatment with the Aβ targeting antibodies aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab in a specialized center real-world sample by the applying the phase 3 clinical trial and the appropriate use recommendations (AUR) inclusion and exclusion criteria to the data set. The post-mortem report was used for defining amyloid positivity and the presence of AD pathology in this study.
DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive study.
SETTING: The multicenter National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center-Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS) and Neuropathology Data Set (NACCNP).
PARTICIPANTS: We included all 3,343 participants of the NACC dataset with available post-mortem pathology reports.
MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS: 887 participants were potential candidates for anti-Aβ immunotherapy as they presented with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and the clinical diagnosis of AD (amnestic AD syndrome). Applying the criterion of amyloid positivity (post mortem report) and the clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to this sample resulted in 83 (9 %), 275 (31 %), and 172 (19 %) participants eligible for treatment with aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, respectively. Applying the criteria of the AUR resulted in 242 (27 %) and 266 (30 %) participants eligible for treatment with aducanumab or lecanemab, respectively. The eligible participant groups for each antibody showed partial, but not full overlap. Co-pathologies were common.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of eligible participants varies between the different antibodies and the selected groups only partly overlap, indicating partly different groups of eligible participants for each antibody. Since not all inclusion and exclusion criteria can be extracted from the NACC-UDS dataset, the real number of eligible patients will be smaller.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40118165,Cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases: A trans-diagnostic approach using a lesion-symptom mapping analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), reflect a spectrum of cognitive impairments unified by cognitive decline. Traditional diagnostic approaches often overlook shared landscapes of these disorders. A transdiagnostic approach, cutting across conventional boundaries, may improve understanding of shared mechanisms. This study uses lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) to identify critical brain structures responsible for cognitive impairments.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), probable AD, and probable bvFTD were recruited from our memory clinic. Diagnoses were made by a multidisciplinary team using established criteria. Participants underwent detailed medical and neurological examinations, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuropsychological assessment. MRI scans were processed using FreeSurfer. LSM was used to assess correlations between brain structures and cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between neuropsychological test scores and reduced volume in specific brain regions. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test was linked to the right hippocampus and left nucleus accumbens. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised correlated with the right hippocampus, left nucleus accumbens, and right middle temporal gyrus. Verbal fluency was linked to the left superior temporal sulcus and left middle temporal gyrus. Digit Span forward correlated with left superior frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal region, while Digit Span backward was linked to the right precuneus. Digit-Symbol Coding was associated with the left inferior parietal region.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights common neural targets in MCI, AD, and bvFTD and their link with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the value of LSM within a transdiagnostic approach to neurodegenerative diseases.",Neuroscience
40034501,Heat shock protein 70 in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias: A possible alternative therapeutic.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a global health issue with a high social burden due to the level of disability it causes in those who suffer from it. In the absence of a therapeutic alternative for this disease, we will follow one of the biochemical pathways involved in the development of AD, which is related to molecular chaperones. The molecules are responsible for eliminating toxins and misfolded proteins at the cerebral level. These chaperones are a set of proteins from the heat shock proteins (HSPs) family, which, among their functions, help maintain homeostasis and protect cells against stress. Various authors have described the activity of HSPs in different neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the activity of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the presence of aberrant proteins characteristic of neurodegeneration, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. The role of HSP70 in AD and other dementias lies in its mechanism, which, along with other proteins from the HSP family, has the capacity to eliminate Aβ aggregates by promoting catalytic pathways. In this review, we explore the biological role of the HSP70 protein in AD and other dementias and its potential therapeutic use.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
39995657,"Neuronal and glial dysfunction, white matter hyperintensities and cognition in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.","This cross-sectional study examined associations between multiple fluid biomarkers of neuronal and glial dysfunction (plasma neurofilament light chain, CSF growth-associated protein 43 and CSF soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), total white matter hyperintensity volume and episodic memory and executive function performance in the context of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status. A total of 563 participants (mean age = 71.9 years, standard deviation = 7.2) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were classified by the amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration framework into no Alzheimer's disease pathology (n = 176), suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (n = 87) or Alzheimer's disease continuum (n = 300) groups. Participants completed baseline neuropsychological assessment, plasma/CSF biomarker collection and MRI. Analyses explored the relative contributions of biomarkers to episodic memory and executive function performance and whether relationships varied by amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration group status. Across all participants, neurofilament light chain (  β ^   = -0.14, P &lt; 0.001) and growth-associated protein 43 (  β ^   = -0.13, P &lt; 0.001) were the strongest biomarkers associated with episodic memory performance, such that greater levels were associated with worse episodic memory. There was a group by growth-associated protein 43 interaction with episodic memory: greater growth-associated protein 43 was associated with lower episodic memory performance in participants classified as Alzheimer's disease continuum relative to the no Alzheimer's disease pathology group (  β ^   = -0.26, P &lt; 0.001). No robust associations between biomarkers and executive function performance or between soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, white matter hyperintensity volume and cognition were observed. Biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury and synaptic dysfunction may independently contribute to episodic memory performance across participants with differing amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration profiles. Growth-associated protein 43 may predict worse episodic memory performance in participants with greater Alzheimer's disease pathology. These biomarkers of neuronal dysfunction may serve as domain-specific cognitive correlates in the context of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status.",Brain Commun
40034342,Differential DNA methylation profiles of Alzheimer's disease-related genomic pathways in the blood of cognitively-intact individuals with and without high impact chronic pain.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are prevalent in older age and their etiologies remain to be understoodand evidence supports potential associations between the two. Both high impact pain and AD have been previously associated with differences in the epigenome. Interactions with the epigenome may serve as a possible underlying mechanism linking high impact pain and AD.
OBJECTIVE: To complete epigenetic canonical pathways analyses related to AD in individuals with and without high-impact knee pain.
METHODS: This manuscript aimed to explore differences in DNA methylation patterns in genes and pathways associated with AD. Blood samples of cognitively intact, community-dwelling adults with high impact knee painmversus pain-free controls were compared on their DNA methylation levels of AD-related genes. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on significantly different DNA Methylation probes by pain group.
RESULTS: There were significant DNA methylation differences between the high impact versus the pain-free control groups in genes and pathways associated with AD (p < 0.05). We found a total of 17,563 differentially methylated CpG probes, including 13,411 hypermethylated CpG probes and 4152 hypomethylated CpG probes. Further, pathway analysis revealed these differences were significantly associated with AD-related pathways associated with AD progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study sample showed AD-related DNA methylation differences and associated potential canonical pathways in those with and without high impact knee pain. These results highlight the need to study overlapping epigenetic modifications underlying high impact pain and AD pathologies. Further studies, including gene expression, are needed to further explore the relationship between epigenetics, chronic pain, and AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40098201,Adherence and intensity in multimodal lifestyle-based interventions for cognitive decline prevention: state-of-the-art and future directions.,"Preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global priority. Multimodal interventions targeting several risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously are currently being tested worldwide under the World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network of clinical trials. Adherence to these interventions is crucial for their success, yet there is significant heterogeneity in adherence reporting across studies, hindering the understanding of adherence barriers and facilitators. This article is a narrative review of available evidence from multimodal dementia prevention trials. A literature search was conducted using medical databases (MEDLINE via PubMed and SCOPUS) to select relevant studies: nonpharmacological multimodal interventions (i.e., combining three or more intervention domains), targeting individuals without dementia, and using changes in cognitive performance and/or incident mild cognitive impairment or dementia as primary outcomes. Based on the findings, we propose future adherence reporting to encompass both participation (average attendance to each intervention component) and lifestyle change using dementia risk scores (e.g., the LIBRA index). Moreover, we provide an estimation of the expected intensity of multimodal interventions, defined as the ratio of the expected dose (i.e., the overall amount of the intervention offered specified in the trial protocol) to duration (in months). Adjusting the expected dose by average adherence enables estimation of the observed dose and intensity, which could be informative for identifying optimal dosage thresholds that maximize cognitive benefits across different populations. Finally, this article provides an overview of the determinants of adherence to multimodal interventions, emphasizing the need for improved adherence reporting to inform the design and implementation of precision prevention interventions.",Alzheimers Res Ther
40046336,The role of microglia in the prion-like transmission of protein aggregates in neurodegeneration.,"Numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis share a neuropathological hallmark: aberrant protein aggregation in the CNS. Microglia, the brain's innate immune cells, also play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Multiple studies indicate that these pathological aggregates can propagate throughout the brain in a prion-like manner. A protein/peptide that adopts a prion-like conformation can induce homologous proteins to misfold into a prion-like conformation through templated seeding, enabling cell-to-cell spread and accelerating protein aggregation throughout the brain. Two important questions in the prion-like paradigm are where the prion-like misfolding occurs and how the prion-like aggregates are spread throughout the CNS. Here, we review the role of microglia and associated inflammation in the prion-like spread of pathologically aggregated proteins/peptides in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing body of evidence suggests that microglia can internalize prion-like proteins and transport them to neighbouring neurons and other glial cells. Microglia may also influence the potential seeding of proteins in neurons and induce inflammatory pathways in their microenvironment. This review aims to broaden the understanding of the role of microglia in the prion-like spread of protein aggregation.",Brain Commun

This study aimed to explore the interaction between the structural and functional brain network in AD using advanced structural-functional coupling (S-F coupling) models to assess whether these changes correlate with cognitive function, Aβ deposition levels, and gene expression. In this study, we utilized multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data from 41 individuals with AD, 112 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 102 healthy controls to explore these mechanisms. We applied different computational models to examine the changes in the S-F coupling associated with AD. Our results showed that the communication and graph harmonic models demonstrated greater heterogeneity and were more sensitive than the statistical models in detecting AD-related pathological changes. In addition, S-F coupling increases with AD progression at the global, subnetwork, and regional node levels, especially in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The S-F coupling of these regions also partially mediated cognitive decline and Aβ deposition. Furthermore, gene enrichment analysis revealed that changes in S-F coupling were strongly associated with the regulation of cellular catabolic processes. This study advances our understanding of the interaction between structural and functional connectivity and highlights the importance of S-F coupling in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in AD.",Neuroimage Clin

We replicated the association of 68 SNPs with LOAD and established polygenetic risk score (PRS) prediction model using significant SNPs. Meta-analysis for MS4A6A rs610932 and PICALM rs3851179 were performed.ResultsAccording to our findings, 14 out of 68 SNPs are validated significantly associated with LOAD (adjusted p &lt; 0.05) after adjusting age and sex in the Chinese population. Besides, after stratification by APOE ε4 status, almost all SNPs retain markedly relationship with LOAD in APOE ε4 noncarriers. However, few loci retain correlation in APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve prediction model for distinguishing LOAD patients from normal subjects were 0.614 for PRS and 0.689 for PRS and APOE. In addition, meta-analysis including this study of East Asian populations confirmed that rs610932 and rs3851179 were dramatically related to the LOAD (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.97; OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.83-0.91).ConclusionsDespite genetic heterogeneity, there are still common loci among different races. PRS based on AD risk-associated SNPs may supplement APOE for better assessing individual risk for AD in Chinese. Besides, interactions between genes and gene environment affect the impact of risk allele on diverse populations.",J Alzheimers Dis

The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to establish the frequency of sarcopenia in individuals with AD and investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and AD.
METHODS: We performed an extensive review of literature databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, through April 2024. The inclusion criteria included studies that provided data on the frequency of sarcopenia in patients with AD or that examined the odds ratios (ORs) associated with these comorbidities. R Studio (4.3.1) was utilized for conducting the statistical analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 27 studies, comprising 3902 AD patients were included. In patients with AD, the combined occurrence of sarcopenia was 33.9%, with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, ranging from 27.6% to 40.2%. Sarcopenia was found in 31.2% (95% CI: 0.223-0.402) and 41.9% (95% CI: 0.321-0.516) of patients with mild and moderate AD, respectively. The OR for the association between AD and sarcopenia was 2.670 (95% CI: 1.566-4.555), suggesting a robust correlation.
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in AD patients, highlighting the need for integrated care approaches to address both cognitive and physical health issues. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological links between AD and sarcopenia.",PLoS One
40121201,Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.,"5-hydroxymethylcytosine, also known as the sixth DNA base of the genome, plays an important role in brain aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about its genome-wide distribution and its association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we report a genome-wide profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in 1079 autopsied brains (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) of older individuals and assess its association with multiple measures of Alzheimer's disease pathologies, including pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β load, and PHFtau tangle density. Of 197,765 5-hydroxymethylcytosine regions detected, we identified 2821 differentially hydroxymethylated regions associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology after controlling for multiple testing and covariates. Many differentially hydroxymethylated regions are located within known Alzheimer's disease loci, such as RIN3, PLCG2, ITGA2B, and USP6NL. Integrative multi-omics analyses support a potential mechanistic role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations in Alzheimer's disease. Our study presents a large-scale genome-wide atlas of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Alzheimer's brain and offers insight into the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",Nat Commun
39986432,Disrupted astrocyte-neuron signaling reshapes brain activity in epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.,"Astrocytes establish dynamic interactions with surrounding neurons and synchronize neuronal networks within a specific range. However, these reciprocal astrocyte-neuronal interactions are selectively disrupted in epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which contributes to the initiation and progression of network hypersynchrony. Deciphering how disrupted astrocyte-neuronal signaling reshapes brain activity is crucial to prevent subclinical epileptiform activity in epilepsy and AD. In this review, we provide an overview of the diverse astrocyte-neuronal crosstalk in maintaining of network activity via homeostatic control of extracellular ions and transmitters, synapse formation and elimination. More importantly, since AD and epilepsy share the common symptoms of neuronal hyperexcitability and astrogliosis, we then explore the crosstalk between astrocytes and neurons in the context of epilepsy and AD and discuss how these disrupted interactions reshape brain activity in pathological conditions. Collectively, this review sheds light on how disrupted astrocyte-neuronal signaling reshapes brain activity in epilepsy and AD, and highlights that modifying astrocyte-neuronal signaling could be a therapeutic approach to prevent epileptiform activity in AD.",Neuroscience
40050444,Neuroinflammatory fluid biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic literature review.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is associated with both early and late stages of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fluid biomarkers are gaining significance in clinical practice for diagnosis in presymptomatic stages, monitoring, and disease prognosis. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to identify fluid biomarkers for neuroinflammation related to clinical stages across the AD continuum and examined long-term outcomes associated with changes in biomarkers.
METHODS: The SLR was conducted per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We used PubMed®, Embase®, and Cochrane Collaboration databases to search for articles in English (between 2012 and 2022) on AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD, using ""neuroinflammation"" or other ""immune"" search strings. Two independent reviewers screened titles and examined data from full-text articles for the SLR.
RESULTS: After the initial screening, 54 studies were prioritized for data extraction based upon their relevance to the SLR research questions. Nine studies for YKL-40, seven studies for sTREM2, and 11 studies for GFAP examined the relationship between the neuroinflammatory biomarkers and the clinical stage of the disease. Nine longitudinal studies further explored the association of fluid biomarkers with long-term clinical outcomes of disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of YKL-40 were elevated in patients with AD dementia, while CSF sTREM2 levels were more strongly associated with preclinical and early symptomatic stages of AD. Plasma GFAP levels remained consistently elevated both in patients with AD dementia and individuals in preclinical stages with β-amyloid pathology. Longitudinal changes in plasma GFAP appeared to be predictive of cognitive decline in patients over time.
DISCUSSION: Neuroinflammatory biomarkers are associated with AD progression. More longitudinal studies in the preclinical and MCI stages of AD are needed to validate fluid biomarkers for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and prognosis in clinical practice.",Mol Psychiatry
40138448,A polymorphism in the BIN1 gene influences its expression and is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease: An integrated analysis.,"BackgroundThe correlation between rs7561528 and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported with varying results, and the potential mechanism of rs7561528 in influencing AD risk remains unexplored.ObjectiveThis study aims to examine the impact of rs7561528 on AD risk and to investigate its potential mechanism.MethodsThis study initially synthesized previously published data to investigate the correlation between rs7561528 and AD risk. Subsequently, an expression quantitative trait loci analysis was conducted to determine whether rs7561528 modulates the expression of BIN1 in human brain tissue.ResultsOur findings revealed that the rs7561528A allele notably escalates the risk of AD in the Caucasian population (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.07-1.28, I² = 33.5%). Similarly, the rs7561528AG genotype also significantly heightens the risk of AD in the same population (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05-1.31, I² = 21.7%). Further analysis demonstrated that the combined rs7561528AA + AG genotype substantially amplifies the risk of AD in the Caucasian population (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.36, I² = 30.0%). Ultimately, we discovered that rs7561528 modulates the expression of BIN1 in human brain tissue.Conclusionsrs7561528 could potentially affect the risk of AD by regulating the expression levels of BIN1 in human brain tissue. This discovery enhances our understanding of novel mechanisms through which rs7561528 may contribute to AD risk.",J Alzheimers Dis
39990626,"Circulating Stress Hormones, Brain Health, and Cognition in Healthy Older Adults: Cross-Sectional Findings and Sex Differences in Age-Well.","BACKGROUND: Increased stress is a proposed risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined cross-sectional associations between circulating stress biomarkers and multimodal measures of brain health and cognition susceptible to AD in older adults and sex-specific subgroups.
METHODS: Baseline data from 132 cognitively unimpaired participants without depression (age, mean ± SD = 74.0 ± 4.0 years, women: n = 80) in the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) were included. Stress hormone levels were measured in overnight fasting blood serum (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and blood plasma (epinephrine, norepinephrine) samples. AD-sensitive measures of brain health, including glucose metabolism (n = 89), cerebral perfusion, gray matter volume, amyloid deposition in a priori regions of interest, and cognitive markers were evaluated. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Higher epinephrine levels were associated (false discovery rate-corrected p &lt; .05) with lower glucose metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex (β = -0.26, p = .008), posterior cingulate cortex (β = -0.32, p = .006), and precuneus (β = -0.27, p = .021) and lower perfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex (β = -0.23, p = .013). Interactions between stress hormones and sex showed (false discovery rate-corrected p &lt; .05) that in women only, higher epinephrine was associated with larger anterior cingulate cortex volume (interaction: β = 0.32, p = .016), whereas in men only, higher cortisol was associated with lower episodic memory performance (interaction: β = 0.98, p = .012).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates the involvement of circulating stress hormones, particularly epinephrine and cortisol, in greater resilience or vulnerability of brain health and cognitive indicators of susceptibility to AD in older adults. The identification of sex-specific patterns in these associations may inform the development of more effective and tailored interventions.",Biol Psychiatry Glob Open Sci
40108503,Association between exposure to organophosphate esters and cognitive function in older adults in the United States: NHANES 2011-2014.,"BACKGROUND: Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are widely used as an alternative to the brominated flame retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The effects of OPEs on the cognitive abilities of older adults remain unclear.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2014. Cognitive function was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) word learning test, the CERAD word recall test, the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). OPE metabolites with detection rates above 50% were included in the study. Weighted multiple linear regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were used to examine the effects of individual and mixed exposures to OPE metabolites on cognitive function.
RESULTS: A total of 762 older adults were included. The weighted linear regression model revealed a positive association between Ln DPHP, Ln BDCPP, and Ln BCPP and the DSST score, while a negative association was observed between Ln DBUP and the DSST score. In the positive WQS model, the index was correlated with DSST score (β = 2.65, 95% CI: 0.40 ~ 4.90, P = 0.02), with DPHP having the highest weight. The results of BKMR analysis indicated a borderline statistical significance in the increase of DSST score when the mixture of OPEs is set to a specific 90th percentile compared to all mixture concentrations set to the median.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall exposure to OPE metabolites are associated with improved cognitive function in older adults in the United States. Further prospective studies with large sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.",BMC Geriatr
40135639,Reduced Functional Connectivity in Nucleus Accumbens Subregions Associates With Cognitive Changes in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important component of the reward circuit, is believed to play an indispensable role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) of NAc subregions in AD patients and to explore their associations with neuropsychological profiles.
METHODS: Total 45 AD patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for this study. Four subregions of the NAc were used as regions of interest for whole-brain FC analysis. Correlation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between the changed FC of brain regions with significant differences and neuropsychological profiles.
RESULTS: Compared with HCs, decreased FC was observed between NAc subregions and regions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), precuneus (PCUN), insula (INS), cerebellum 8, and putamen in AD patients (Gaussian random field [GRF] corrected, voxel-level p < 0.001, cluster-level p < 0.05). Furthermore, the FC between the left core and left PCUN was correlated with the score of the auditory verbal learning test immediate recall task in AD patients (r = 0.441, p = 0.003, Bonferroni corrected).
CONCLUSION: Disruptions in connectivity between the NAc subregions and important cognitive-related areas may be related to the cognitive deficits observed in AD patients, especially episodic memory function.",Brain Behav
40111696,Periodontal Treatment to Improve General Health and Manage Systemic Diseases.,"Periodontitis is increasingly recognized for its role in overall health and its associations with systemic conditions. Shared etiological factors, including microbiological, immunological, genetic, and environmental influences, have prompted interest in the potential impact of periodontal therapy on broader health outcomes. The oral microbiome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, with microbial imbalances (dysbiosis) contributing to inflammation and systemic disease progression. Additionally, immune responses to periodontal infection, such as chronic inflammation and dysregulated immune activity, are central to linking periodontitis with conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disorders. This chapter explores the connections between periodontal treatment and systemic diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, digestive disorders, and respiratory disease. It also reviews the current research on the mechanisms, including microbial and immune factors, that underlie these associations. By emphasizing the role of periodontal health, the oral microbiome, and immune regulation in disease prevention and management, this chapter underscores the importance of integrated healthcare approaches to improve patient outcomes.",Adv Exp Med Biol
40157941,A group based network analysis for Alzheimer's disease fMRI data.,"Network modeling are widely using in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Typically, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was widely applied to construct brain connectivity network from BOLD signals of regions of interest. However, it often results in significant intra-group variability and complicates the identification of disease-specific functional connectivity patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel brain network construction strategy, called SNBG, which uses aggregated information from the control group to derive a single-sample network. We compare SNBG and the PCC based method on a dataset from an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. SNBG method captures more stable connections between regions of interest (ROIs) and increases classification accuracy from 89.24% of PCC based method to 97.13%. In addition, in AD-related local networks, such as default mode network (DMN), medial frontal network (MFN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), SNBG demonstrates lower intra-group heterogeneity than the PCC based method.",Sci Rep

40121723,"Long-term nucleus basalis cholinergic lesions alter the structure of cortical vasculature, astrocytic density and microglial activity in Wistar rats.","Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are the sole source of cholinergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in humans and the primary source in rodents. This system undergoes early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. BFCNs terminal synapses are involved in the regulation of the cerebral blood flow by making classical synaptic contacts with other neurons. Additionally, they are located in proximity to cortical cerebral blood vessels, forming connections with various cell types of the neurovascular unit (NVU), including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytic end-feet. However, the effects of the BFCNs input on NVU components remain unresolved. To address this issue, we immunolesioned the nucleus basalis by administering bilateral stereotaxic injections of the cholinergic immunotoxin 192-IgG-Saporin in 2.5-month-old Wistar rats. Seven months post-lesion, we observed a significant reduction in cortical vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive synapses. This was accompanied by changes in the diameter of cortical capillaries and precapillary arterioles, as well as lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Additionally, the cholinergic immunolesion increased the density of cortical astrocytes and microglia in the cortex. At these post-BFCN-lesion stages, astrocytic end-feet exhibited an increased co-localization with arterioles. The number of microglia in the parietal cortex correlated with cholinergic loss and exhibited morphological changes indicative of an intermediate activation state. This was supported by decreased levels of proinflammatory mediators IFN-γ, IL-1β, and KC/GRO (CXCL1), and by increased expression of M2 markers SOCS3, IL4Rα, YM1, ARG1, and Fizz1. Our findings offer a novel insight: that the loss of nucleus basalis cholinergic input negatively impacts cortical blood vessels, NVU components, and microglia phenotype.",Neurobiol Aging
40001482,Gintonin Binds to Reduced LPA4 Receptor Subtype in Human Cortical Neurons in Alzheimer's Disease Brains.,"Ginseng, a traditional herbal medicine with a long history of use, is known to support human health, particularly by influencing brain function. Recent studies have identified gintonin, a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand derived from ginseng, as a key bioactive. However, the specific LPA receptor subtypes targeted by gintonin in the human brain to exert its anti-Alzheimer's (AD) effects remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the LPA receptor subtype targeted by gintonin in the human cortex. Using a fluorescent gintonin conjugate, we investigated receptor binding in cortical samples from healthy individuals (n = 4) and AD patients (n = 4). Our results demonstrated that fluorescent gintonin selectively binds to human cortical neurons rather than glial cells and that gintonin-binding sites are co-localized with the LPA4 receptor subtype. Furthermore, the expression of LPA4 receptors was significantly reduced in the cortical neurons of AD patients. These results suggest that the LPA4 receptor may serve as a novel histopathological marker for AD and represent a promising therapeutic target for gintonin-based prevention and treatment strategies.",Biomolecules
40135725,HYTANE-Identified Latrophilin-3 Cleavage by Meprin β Leads to Loss of the Interaction Domains.,"The metalloprotease meprin β is upregulated in neurons and astrocytes of Alzheimer's disease patients' brains. While the role of meprin β as the β-secretase of amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been characterized, its broader substrate profile within the brain remains largely unexplored. Hence, to identify additional substrates, we conducted N-terminomics of brain lysates from mice overexpressing meprin β in astrocytes employing the Hydrophobic Tagging-Assisted N-terminal Enrichment (HYTANE) strategy. We observed 3906 (82.2%) N-terminal peptides and identified seven new substrates that match meprin β in terms of localization and cleavage specificity. Of note, the meprin β overexpressing mice show mild cognitive impairments caused by amyloidogenic APP processing alongside hyperactivity and altered exploratory behavior seemingly independent of APP cleavage. Hence, latrophilin-3 was of particular interest, as latrophilin-3 defects are associated with hyperactivity in mice and human. In brain lysates from mice overexpressing meprin β in astrocytes as well as in cellulo, we validated the cleavage of latrophilin-3, resulting in the release of two N-terminal domains. These domains promote interactions with neuronal proteins such as fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins, promoting adequate synapse formation. Thus, meprin β might affect synaptic integrity by cleaving interaction domains of latrophilin-3, potentially exacerbating the observed hyperactivity phenotype.",J Proteome Res
40016187,Neurofind: using deep learning to make individualised inferences in brain-based disorders.,"Within precision psychiatry, there is a growing interest in normative models given their ability to parse heterogeneity. While they are intuitive and informative, the technical expertise and resources required to develop normative models may not be accessible to most researchers. Here we present Neurofind, a new freely available tool that bridges this gap by wrapping sound and previously tested methods on data harmonisation and advanced normative models into a web-based platform that requires minimal input from the user. We explain how Neurofind was developed, how to use the Neurofind website in four simple steps ( www.neurofind.ai ), and provide exemplar applications. Neurofind takes as input structural MRI images and outputs two main metrics derived from independent normative models: (1) Outlier Index Score, a deviation score from the normative brain morphology, and (2) Brain Age, the predicted age based on an individual's brain morphometry. The tool was trained on 3362 images of healthy controls aged 20-80 from publicly available datasets. The volume of 101 cortical and subcortical regions was extracted and modelled with an adversarial autoencoder for the Outlier index model and a support vector regression for the Brain age model. To illustrate potential applications, we applied Neurofind to 364 images from three independent datasets of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. In Alzheimer's disease, 55.2% of patients had very extreme Outlier Index Scores, mostly driven by larger deviations in temporal-limbic structures and ventricles. Patients were also homogeneous in how they deviated from the norm. Conversely, only 30.1% of schizophrenia patients were extreme outliers, due to deviations in the hippocampus and pallidum, and patients tended to be more heterogeneous than controls. Both groups showed signs of accelerated brain ageing.",Transl Psychiatry
40136456,Older Amyloid Beta as a Candidate Blood Biomarker of Early Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-A Preliminary Study.,"(1) Background/Objectives: The pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to begin decades before its clinical onset. This period, although imperceptible to the patient, encompasses a gradual neuronal loss. The first symptoms of dementia, often classified as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in many cases converts into incipient AD, but can also remain stable or even reverse to cognitive norm. An easy and fast blood-based method of identifying patients at risk of conversion to AD would allow for the application of disease-altering therapies. This preliminary study focuses on the identification and assessment of the relationship between plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) and cognitive performance in older Polish adults with respect to its adequacy as a biomarker of an early cognitive deterioration. (2) Methods: The preliminary research sample consisted of 230 participants, 109 females and 121 males, aged 65 plus. The association between plasma Aβ concentrations with cognitive status, gender, and age were assessed. The analyses were conducted in three categories of cognitive performance: cognitive norm, mild cognitive impairment, and mild dementia, based on results of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and functional tests. (3) Results: No significant differences in plasma Aβ levels for different cognitive statuses were identified. No significant differences were found in Aβ levels based on age or gender. (4) Conclusions: In order to thoroughly explore the power of research on plasma Aβ with respect to early cognitive deterioration, further prospective studies are required.",Curr Issues Mol Biol
40018518,Non-pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease: an update.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs memory, cognitive function, and the ability to perform daily tasks. The pathological features of AD include β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Current AD treatments target pathological changes but often fail to noticeably slow disease progression and can cause severe complications, limiting their effectiveness. In addition to therapies targeting the core pathology of AD, a more comprehensive approach may be needed for its treatment. In recent years, non-pharmacological treatments such as physical therapy, exercise therapy, cell therapy, and nanoparticles have shown great potential in mitigating disease progression and alleviating clinical symptoms. This article reviews recent advances in non-pharmacological treatment approaches for AD, highlighting their contributions to AD management and facilitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies.",Front Aging Neurosci
39998021,Targeting Amyloid Pathology in Early Alzheimer's: The Promise of Donanemab-Azbt.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to examine the potential role of donanemab-azbt in the treatment and management of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a focus on its efficacy, safety, and clinical relevance based on data from key clinical trials.
DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was conducted using relevant keywords such as ""donanemab"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Kisunla"", ""TRAILBLAZER clinical trials"", and ""amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)"". Additional data were extracted from clinical trial records (clinicaltrials.gov), conference abstracts, and product monographs.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Only English-language studies conducted in human populations were included. Clinical trials and peer-reviewed studies detailing the efficacy, safety, and mechanistic insights of donanemab-azbt were prioritized.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Key findings from the TRAILBLAZER series of clinical trials highlighted the potential of donanemab-azbt in slowing cognitive and functional decline in early-stage AD: (1) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (Phase 2): This trial focused on participants with intermediate levels of tau protein. Results demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of cognitive and functional decline. (2) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (Phase 3): A large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study confirmed the efficacy of donanemab-azbt in reducing amyloid plaque accumulation and cognitive decline. Key results included a 35% slowing of decline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and a 36% slowing on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Additional secondary outcomes showed improvements in activities of daily living and reduced risk of disease progression. (3) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3: This ongoing trial is evaluating donanemab's potential in delaying or preventing Alois Alzheimer in cognitively normal individuals with amyloid plaques, broadening the scope of early intervention strategies. (4) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4: A head-to-head comparison with aducanumab revealed superior amyloid plaque clearance with donanemab. (5) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 5: Currently recruiting, this trial aims to evaluate safety and efficacy across diverse populations with varying tau levels and comorbidities. (6) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 (Phase 3b): This trial investigates modified dosing regimens to reduce ARIA while maintaining efficacy, particularly in populations with genetic risk factors like ApoE ε4 homozygotes.
RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Donanemab-azbt represents a promising treatment option for patients with early-stage AD. It specifically targets and reduces amyloid beta plaques, a hallmark of the disease, potentially slowing progression and preserving cognitive function. However, its administration requires careful patient selection, including genetic testing for ApoE ε4 status, to mitigate risks of ARIA. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the importance of close monitoring during treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Donanemab-azbt offers a new avenue for managing early-stage AD, showing promise in reducing amyloid burden and slowing cognitive decline. While its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical trials, further research is essential to validate long-term outcomes, assess effectiveness across diverse populations, and refine dosing strategies to minimize side effects. With continued investigation, donanemab-azbt could significantly impact the clinical landscape of AD treatment.",Pharmacy (Basel)
40083995,Label-free Aβ plaque detection in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue using infrared microscopy and neural networks.,"We present a novel method for the label-free detection of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, the key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, in human brain tissue sections. Conventionally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is employed for the characterization of Aβ plaques, hindering subsequent analysis. Here, a semi-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to detect Aβ plaques in quantum cascade laser infrared (QCL-IR) microscopy images. Laser microdissection (LMD) is then used to precisely extract plaques from snap-frozen, unstained tissue sections. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics reveals a loss of soluble proteins in IHC stained samples. Our method prevents this loss and provides a novel tool that expands the scope of molecular analysis methods to chemically native plaques. Insight into soluble plaque components will complement our understanding of plaques and their role in Alzheimer's disease.",Heliyon
40147763,Nutritional Interventions for Preventing Cognitive Decline in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Network Meta-Analysis and Mendelian Randomization Study.,"BACKGROUND: As the population ages rapidly, cognitive impairment, especially in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), has become a crucial public health issue. Nutritional interventions have garnered attention as a promising non-pharmacological strategy for maintaining cognitive function and decelerating its decline.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various nutritional interventions in preventing cognitive impairment and elucidate intricate biological pathways linking nutritional interventions to cognitive function through a comprehensive approach involving systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA), and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
METHODS: We utilized pair-wise comparisons and NMA to evaluate the efficacy of different nutritional interventions on cognitive function in patients with decreased cognitive abilities. A systematic search in three biomedical databases was performed for double-blinded, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or head-to-head comparisions up to December 31, 2024. The NMA has been registered at the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42022331173). Moreover, to clarify the biological mechanisms linking nutritional interventions to cognitive impairment, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the potential causal relationships between 9 genetically predicted nutrient levels derived from extensive genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and 12 biomarkers linked to brain aging.
RESULTS: This study encompassed 52 trials with 8,452 participants, 9 GWASs examining genetically predicted nutrient levels with a total of 603,996 participants, and 12 GWASs investigating brain aging biomarkers with a total of 2,405,530 participants. The NMA demonstrated that the multi-ingredient intervention outperformed other interventions significantly (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 2.03; 95% credible interval [95% CrI] = 0.97-3.09, P = 0.0002). In the MR analysis, the findings indicated that the multi-ingredient intervention was linked to reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (odds ratios [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.93-0.99, P = 0.014), suggesting that the multi-ingredient intervention may mitigate cognitive impairment by reducing inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our NMA amalgamated evidence underscoring multi-ingredient interventions as the most efficacious strategy for attenuating cognitive decline in individuals with MCI and AD. Furthermore, the MR analysis unveiled the mechanisms underpinning the protective effects of multi-ingredient interventions, potentially offering benefits even in the early stages of neurodegeneration by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation.",Clin Nutr ESPEN
40108701,Tau-PET pathology in the subregions of the amygdala and its associations with cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The amygdala plays a role in behavior and emotional response and is vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, yet little is known about amygdala tau accumulation before clinical symptom onset. To investigate whether certain amygdala nuclei are particularly vulnerable to degeneration and might underlie early neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, we aimed to characterize subregional amygdala tau pathology and its correlates associations with established biomarkers of early AD and cognitive-behavioral measures in Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers of autosomal dominant AD.
METHODS: Participants included 25 cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers and 37 non-carrier family members from the Colombia-Boston (COLBOS) Biomarker Study. Measures included 18F-flortaucipir, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning, Trail Making Test, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory. We examined group differences in amygdala tau levels (whole amygdala, lateral nucleus and basal nucleus) and analyzed tau associations with disease markers and clinical measures.
RESULTS: Amygdala tau levels were higher in unimpaired carriers compared to non-carriers. Among carriers, the basal nucleus showed a greater tau burden than the lateral nucleus, and tau accumulation correlated with closer estimated age to clinical onset and increased cortical amyloid. Additionally, tau in both the basal and lateral amygdala was associated with poorer working memory, lower executive function and greater depressive symptoms. However, amygdala tau did not correlate with symptoms of anxiety. Notably, tau levels in the basal amygdala differentiated carriers from non-carriers, with higher predictive accuracy when neuropsychiatric measures were included.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in autosomal dominant AD, tau accumulation in the amygdala begins early in the basal nucleus, while both the basal and the lateral nuclei are associated with early cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms.

40152679,Development of a Proton Spin Network Fingerprint Library to Support Mass Spectrometry-Based Identification of Pharmacophore-Bearing Constituents in the Botanical Supplement Centella asiatica.,"Centella asiatica (L.) Urban (Apiaceae) has been utilized for centuries in traditional medicine systems in Southeast Asia and Southern Africa, including Madagascar. Previous studies have reported evidence of the therapeutic potential of C. asiatica formulations in models of Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) have been identified to be among the pharmacologically relevant metabolites contributing to the botanical's cognitive enhancement and neuroprotective effects. Isomers of CQAs are, however, difficult to differentiate by commonly used LC-MS techniques, making the characterization, standardization, and batch-to-batch consistency of these formulations challenging. Individual CQAs have unique proton Spin Network Fingerprints (pSNFs) that can be used to distinguish between CQA regioisomers within complex extracts. This work describes the development of a CQA-focused pSNF library that can be used to complement LC-MS methods for the accurate metabolite identification and characterization of bioactive C. asiatica fractions and extracts. The isolation of two new (1 and 2) and four known (3-6) CQAs and CQA analogues from C. asiatica and their contribution to the pSNF library are also discussed herein.",J Nat Prod
40058974,Colocalization of Neurotransmitters in Hippocampus and Afferent Systems: Possible Functional Role.,"In neurophysiology, the transmitter phenotype is considered as an indicator of neuronal identity. It has become known at the end of last century that a nerve cell can produce and use several different molecules to communicate with other neurons. These could be ""classical"" transmitters: glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (or acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine), as well as secondary messengers, mainly neuropeptides released from the same neurons. In the case, when classical neurotransmitters are released together from the same nerve cell, this event is called cotransmission or corelease (release from the same vesicles). In this review article, the term ""cotransmission"" is used in a broad sense, denoting neurons that can release more than one classical mediator. Since transmitters are often intermediate products of metabolism and are found in many cells, the neuron classification is currently based on the carrier proteins (transporters) that ""pack"" neurotransmitters synthesized in the cytoplasm into vesicles. Here, we limit the issue of colocalization of the main neurotransmitters in mammals to the neurons of hippocampus and those structures that send their pathways to it. The review considers problems concerning the mechanisms of multitransmitter signaling, as well as probable functional role of mediator colocalization in the work of hippocampus, which yet has been poorly understood. It has been suggested that co-expression of different mediator phenotypes is involved in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition in different regions of hippocampus, facilitates rapid selection of information processing mode, induction of long-term potentiation, maintenance of spatial coding by place cells, as well as ensuring flexibility of learning and formation of working memory. However, the functional role of mediator colocalization, as well as the mechanisms of release of ""dual"" transmitters, have not been fully elucidated. The solution of these problems will advance some areas of fundamental neuroscience and help in the treatment of those diseases, where disruption of the balance between excitation and inhibition is detected, such as, for example, in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and many others.",Biochemistry (Mosc)
40095668,Elevated circulating cathepsin S levels are associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in a cohort of patients reporting memory complaints.,"BackgroundAs a member of the cysteine protease family, cathepsin S has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), primarily by promoting inflammation.ObjectiveCurrent evidence regarding the role of cathepsin S primarily comes from animal studies. This study aims to explore the clinical relevance of cathepsin S in AD.MethodsIn a cohort of older adults aged 60 or above with memory complaints, we examined baseline plasma levels of cathepsin S and assessed their association with cognitive decline and biomarkers of neurodegeneration during a 36-month follow-up.ResultsPlasma levels of cathepsin S were significantly higher in individuals experiencing longitudinal cognitive decline compared to those without cognitive decline. Furthermore, plasma levels of cathepsin S were associated with declines in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and increases in neurofilament light and pTau181 levels. Higher plasma cathepsin S levels were linked to an increased risk of longitudinal cognitive decline (decrease in MMSE scores of 3 or more), adjusting for age, sex, education, APOE genotype, alcohol consumption, smoking, and comorbidities.ConclusionsThis study provides additional evidence supporting the potential role of cathepsin S in the pathogenesis of AD from a clinical perspective.",J Alzheimers Dis
40034522,Heterogeneous treatment effects of BCG vaccine on Alzheimer's disease risk.,"BACKGROUND: This project has investigated the role of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a potential treatment against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: To further establish that BCG treatment results in lower risk of ADRD through novel machine learning methods and to analyze the heterogeneity of treatment effects.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from May 28, 1987 to May 6, 2021, in patients who were 50 years or older and were diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Follow-up duration was 15-years. Machine learning algorithms using survival analysis and the random forest algorithm were the primary methods of data analysis.
RESULTS: The research has found that on average, NMIBC patients who received BCG treatment had a 6.9% (95% CI: 0.43%, 13.4%) lower risk of developing ADRD compared to those who did not. Heterogeneous treatment effects were also detected for those with a history of mental health disorders and also for those with a history of respiratory diseases. Those with mental health disorders were at a 14.7% (95% CI: 0.6%, 28.9%) reduced risk of ADRD if they received BCG treatment compared to no BCG treatment. Additionally, those taking BCG with respiratory diseases increased risk of ADRD by 13.6% (95% CI: 1.1%, 26.1%) compared to those with no BCG treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: BCG is associated with a lower risk of ADRD through novel analysis methods and has detected heterogeneity of treatment effects. This presents BCG as a potential low-cost method, with few side-effects, to prevent ADRD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40106321,"Assessing brain vascular impairment, white matter lesions and ApoE status as predictors of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in a multicentre sample of patients with Alzheimer's disease: a multidisciplinary retrospective study.","BACKGROUND: Understanding pathogenetic background and risk factors is the primary step to a better behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) management. To this aim, this exploratory study is designed to sketch some indicative correlations between BPSD severity and vascular, genetic and cognitive variables.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study conducted on medical reports of 135 Alzheimer Dementia (AD) patients from two memory clinics. Each subject underwent clinical examination and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), mini mental state examination (MMSE) and behavioral assessment using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). This real-world cross-sectional study aimed to correlate the load of white matter lesions and global vascular compromise with clinical assessment. In addition, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was checked in 92 patients. Data were analysed performing Spearman correlation and principal component analysis (PCA).
RESULTS: BPSD severity was independent from cognitive impairment, vascular impairment, white matter lesions and ApoE status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not confirm the possible role for vascular impairment in BPSD severity as previously reported. Studies focusing on different biological features in relation to other structural, psychosocial and environmental factors are needed in order to get a more reliable model.",Ann Ist Super Sanita
39990831,"[Diagnostic Value of Phosphorylated tau217 and Other Plasma Biomarkers for Cognitive Dysfunction in the Populations of Deyang City, Sichuan Province, China].","OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD), a continuous disease spectrum, includes the symptomatic stages of the period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the dementia period, also known as AD dementia. Focusing on MCI and AD dementia screening, i.e., AD spectrum screening, we analyzed the value of plasma biomarkers for diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in the local populations of Deyang City, Sichuan Province, China to provide evidence for the early screening and diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted between August 2023 and October 2023 among people aged 50 years or older in Deyang City, Sichuan Province. The survey covered demographic information, information on medical history, and cognitive function assessment. Subjects with MCI were included in the MCI group, those with AD dementia were included in the AD group, and the others were included in the healthy controls (HC) group. A partial sample, including all patients with AD dementia and a randomized sample of MCI patients and HC, was drawn. Then, the plasma levels of four cognition-related biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217), were measured using an ultrasensitive digital chip immunoassay technology independently developed in China. Amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using Aβ molecular probes in all AD dementia patients and some of the MCI patients. The diagnostic value of the plasma biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 2833 subjects were investigated, including 30 (1.1%) with AD dementia, 437 (15.4%) with MCI, and 2366 (83.5%) with HC. We measured the plasma levels of 4 biomarkers of 30 AD dementia patients, 50 MCI patients, and 35 HC. Plasma p-tau217 performed best in differentiating AD dementia from HC and MCI, with the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curves being 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87-0.98), respectively. Plasma p-tau217 levels in the AD dementia, MCI, and HC groups were (2.32±1.27), (0.54±0.45), and (0.42±0.19) pg/mL, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001). A total of 36 patients underwent Aβ PET examination. Plasma p-tau217 showed the best performance in the diagnosis of Aβ deposition (AUC: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96-1.00). Plasma p-tau217 levels were higher in Aβ-deposition-positive patients ([2.52±1.17] pg/mL) than those in Aβ-deposition-negative patients ([0.53±0.19] pg/mL), and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001). Plasma p-tau217 levels were significantly and positively correlated with Aβ PET uptake values in multiple brain regions of the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes (r&gt;0.70, P&lt;0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers measured with a technology independently developed in China demonstrate good performance in diagnosing AD dementia. Plasma p-tau217, in particular, demonstrates the highest diagnostic value and can be used for AD dementia screening of large populations.",Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban
40149902,On-Tissue Chemical Derivatization for Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Fatty Acids with Enhanced Detection Sensitivity.,"The dysregulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism is linked to various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for the visualization of FA distribution in brain tissues but is often limited by low detection sensitivity and high background interference. In this work, we introduce a novel on-tissue chemical derivatization method for FAs using Girard's Reagent T (GT) as a derivatization reagent combined with 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide (CMPI) as a coupling reagent and triethylamine (TEA) to provide a basic environment for the reaction. This method significantly enhances the detection sensitivity of FAs, achieving a 1000-fold improvement over traditional negative ion mode analysis. Our method enabled us to observe a notable depletion of oleic acid in the corpus callosum of AD mouse model brain tissue sections compared to wild-type control brain tissue sections. The reliability of our method was validated using LC-MS/MS, which confirmed the presence of eight distinct GT-labeled FAs across various tissue locations. This approach not only improves FA detection in brain tissues but also has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of FA dynamics associated with AD pathogenesis.",Biomolecules
40017898,Impact of study partner replacement in a mild cognitive impairment clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, including trials enrolling patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), participants must enroll with a study partner (SP). SPs ensure compliance and are a source of study data, including assessments of the participant's cognition and function. Consistency in SP reporting is essential to trial data integrity.
METHODS: We quantified SP replacement and its impact on bias and variance of SP-reported AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for MCI (ADCS-ADL-MCI) in the ADCS Vitamin E/Donepezil MCI Trial. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between SP type (spouse or non-spouse) and the odds of experiencing SP change. We used generalized estimating equations to longitudinally model the differences in consecutively recorded ADCS-ADL-MCI scores as a function of whether SP change occurred. We used a similar model to quantify end-of-study change from baseline in ADCS-ADL-MCI scores.
RESULTS: Among 768 participants, 40 (5%) experienced at least one SP change. We estimated that the odds of experiencing a SP change were 65% lower for spousal dyads when compared to non-spousal dyads (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.18-0.67]). Compared to those with a consistent SP, participants who experienced a SP change had, on average, a consecutive visit absolute score difference that was 1.60 points greater in magnitude (95% CI: [0.62-2.57]), suggesting greater volatility. ADCS-ADL-MCI scores were neither systematically higher nor lower when SP change occurred, on average (-0.23; 95% CI: [-1.60, 1.14]), suggesting minimal bias. The estimated difference in variance for end-of-study change from baseline ADCS-ADL-MCI was observed to be higher for those with SP change compared to those without, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.29; 95% CI: [0.47-1.17]).
CONCLUSION: SP replacement occurred for a meaningful number of participants but did not result in systematic bias on a functional outcome in this trial, but it did increase variability.Highlights: Among participants in a mild cognitive impairment trial, approximately 5% experienced at least one study partner replacement.The estimated odds of replacement were 60% lower for participants with a spousal study partner at baseline, compared to those with a non-spouse partner.We observed increased variance, but not bias, in the mean within-participant change in consecutive ADCS-ADL-MCI scores among participants experiencing study partner replacement.We observed greater variance for end-of-study change from baseline ADCS-ADL-MCI for those who experienced a study partner replacement, compared to those who did not.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
39997199,Preparation of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Peptides from Yellowfin Tuna Pancreas Using Moderate Ultrasound-Assisted Enzymatic Hydrolysis.,"Bioactive peptides represent a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by maintaining cholinergic system homeostasis through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This study focused on extracting AChE inhibitory peptides from yellowfin tuna pancreas using moderate ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis (MUE). Firstly, papain and MUE stood out from five enzymes and four enzymatic hydrolysis methods, respectively, by comparing the degree of hydrolysis and AChE inhibitory activity of different pancreatic protein hydrolysates. Subsequently, the optimal MUE conditions were obtained by single-factor, Plackett-Burman, and response surface methodologies. The pancreatic protein hydrolysate prepared under optimal MUE conditions was then purified by ultrafiltration followed by RP-HPLC, from which a novel AChE inhibitory peptide (LLDF) was identified by LC-MS/MS and virtual screening. LLDF effectively inhibited AChE activity by a competitive inhibition mechanism, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 18.44 ± 0.24 μM. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation revealed that LLDF bound robustly to the active site of AChE via hydrogen bonds. These findings provided a theoretical basis for the valuable use of yellowfin tuna pancreas and introduced a new viewpoint on the potential therapeutic advantages of AChE inhibitory peptides for future AD treatment.",Mar Drugs
40128188,Determining the Role of Sex and APOE4 status on Psychosis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BackgroundPsychosis occurs in approximately 41% of patients living with Alzheimer's disease. Previous findings from our group based on analyses of a neuropathological cohort suggest that among AD patients with Lewy Body pathology, female APOE4 homozygotes are at significantly greater risk of psychosis. This study aims to replicate this finding in a clinical cohort using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.MethodsOur group used data from a sample of patients with AD in the ADNI database from the ADNI1, ADNI2, ADNI3, and ADNIGO studies. We defined psychosis status as experiencing hallucinations or delusions at one time point based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We then used forward binary logistic regression to determine if sex and APOE4 status are predictors of AD + P.ResultsIn total there were 204 participants who met the inclusion criteria, 133 of which were male, and 71 of which were female. Fifty-six patients were APOE4 non-carriers, 109 patients were APOE4 heterozygote carriers, and 39 were APOE4 homozygote carriers. In total, there were 59 patients with psychosis. When adjusting for mini mental state examination score, adjusted hippocampal volume, and age, we demonstrate that female APOE4 homozygotes have a significantly increased risk of psychosis compared to other groups (P = 0.0264, OR = 19.50).DiscussionThe results of our study demonstrate a significant association between psychosis risk and female APOE4 homozygotes, thus corroborating findings from a neuropathological cohort. The effects of APOE ε4 on psychosis risk are significant only in females, and not in males.",J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol

40163154,Generating synthetic brain PET images of synaptic density based on MR T1 images using deep learning.,"PURPOSE: Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) in human brains is an important biomarker of synaptic loss associated with several neurological disorders. However, SV2A tracers, such as [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J, are less available in practice due to constrains such as cost, radiation exposure and onsite cyclotron. We therefore aim to generate synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET images based on MRI in this study.
METHODS: We implemented a convolution-based 3D encoder-decoder to predict [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J SV2A PET images. A total of 160 participants who underwent both MRI and [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET imaging, including individuals with schizophrenia, cannabis use disorder, Alzheimer's disease, were used in this study. The model was trained on pairs of T1-weighted MRI and [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J distribution volume ratio images, and tested through a 10-fold cross-validation process. The image translation accuracy was evaluated based on the mean squared error, structural similarity index, percentage bias and Pearson's correlation coefficient between the ground truth and the predicted images. Additionally, we assessed the prediction accuracy of selected regions of interest (ROIs) crucial for brain disorders to evaluate our results.
RESULTS: The generated SV2A PET images are visually similar to the ground truth in terms of contrast and tracer distribution, quantitatively with low bias (< 2%) and high similarity (> 0.9). Across all diagnostic categories and ROIs, including the hippocampus, frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions, the synthetic SV2A PET images exhibit an average bias of less than 5% compared to the ground truth. The model also demonstrates a capacity for noise reduction, producing images of higher quality compared to the low-dose scans.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that it is feasible to generate robust SV2A PET images with promising accuracy from MRI via a data-driven approach.",EJNMMI Phys
39975464,Two new positive psychosocial measures for persons living with dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Differences in adaptive strategies used by individuals and families living with dementia have the potential to impact day-to-day well-being. The Living Well Inventory for Dementia (LWI-D) is a new measure to capture these strategies and to illuminate new options to support families living with dementia. The Quality of Day Scale (QODS) is a new measure to capture global well-being in persons based on a shorter temporal frame than traditional quality of life measures. This article summarizes the initial evaluation of the LWI-D and the QODS for face validity, content validity, and user acceptability.
METHODS: Initial acceptability and feasibility testing were conducted with a sample of 17 community-dwelling individuals with early-stage dementia (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] scores of 12-30).After revision and optimization of the two measures, a second pilot test was conducted with a sample of 30 dyads (persons living with dementia and family caregivers) in nursing home, assisted living, and community settings.
RESULTS: Data from both pilot studies are reported including item analysis and quantitative and qualitative results. Outcomes related to convergent validity between the LWI-D and the QODS with measures of positive affect-balance, quality of life, and well-being are presented. Within-dyad differences in ratings on both measures are discussed.
DISCUSSION: The LWI-D and the QODS are developing measures that warrant further testing and may enhance the ability to (1) identify strengths in living well with dementia, and (2) identify and test new interventions to bolster care and support.
HIGHLIGHTS: This article describes the process used to develop and test two new measures for research and clinical practice related to positive psychosocial approaches to dementia.The measures were developed with a team that included persons living with Alzheimer's disease as co-researchers in the process.A novel method of human-centered design was used to cultivate deep empathy, generate options, and conduct small, iterative tests of prototype measures.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40158456,Advanced convolutional neural network with attention mechanism for Alzheimer's disease classification using MRI.,"This paper introduces a novel convolutional neural network model with an attention mechanism to advance Alzheimer disease (AD) classification using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The model architecture is meticulously crafted to enhance feature extraction and selectively focus on crucial regions within brain images, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. A unique component, the MRI Segmentation Block (MSB), is introduced to manage the skull stripping task effectively, highlighting the model ability to learn from complex, multilayered information. We have incorporated a detailed experimental evaluation of the MSB, demonstrating its superior performance in cranial debridement tasks compared to existing methods. The experiments involved a range of MRI scans, assessing the MSB's accuracy through metrics like the Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index against ground truth annotations by expert radiologists. The results substantiate the MSB's effectiveness, setting a new benchmark for precision in medical imaging diagnostics. The proposed method integrates densely connected neural networks with a connection-wise attention model to extract multiscale features from MRI scans. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is fine-tuned to emphasize salient features significantly associated with various stages of Alzheimer's disease, thereby setting a new benchmark for precision in medical imaging diagnostics. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional and contemporary approaches, with our model achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes it suitable for clinical applications where resources are limited. This study represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic process for AD, with potential implications for improving patient outcomes in clinical settings.",Comput Biol Med
39989617,"Predicting the impact of missense mutations on an unresolved protein's stability, structure, and function: A case study of Alzheimer's disease-associated TREM2 R47H variant.","AlphaFold2 (AF2) has spurred a revolution in predicting unresolved structures of wild-type proteins with high accuracy. However, AF2 falls short of predicting the effects of missense mutations on unresolved protein structures that may be informative to efforts in personalized medicine. Over the last decade, countless in-silico methods have been developed to predict the pathogenicity of point mutations on resolved structures, but no studies have evaluated their capabilities on unresolved protein structures predicted by AF2. Herein, we investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-causing coding variants of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) receptor using in-silico mutagenesis techniques on the AF2-predicted structure. We first demonstrated that the predicted structure retained a high accuracy in critical regions of the extracellular domain and subsequently validated the in-silico mutagenesis methods by evaluating the effects of the strongest risk variant R47H of TREM2. After validation of the R47H variant, we predicted the molecular basis and effects on protein stability and ligand-binding affinity of the R62H and D87N variants that remain unknown in current literature. By comparing it with the R47H variant, our analysis reveals that R62H and D87N variants exert a much less pronounced effect on the structural stability of TREM2. These in-silico findings show the possibility that the R62H and D87N mutations are likely less pathogenic than the R47H AD. Lastly, we investigated the Nasu-Hakola (NHD)-causing Y38C and V126G TREM2 as a comparison and found that they imposed greater destabilization compared to AD-causing variants. We believe that the in-silico mutagenesis methods described here can be applied broadly to evaluate the ever-growing numbers of protein mutations/variants discovered in human genetics study for their potential in diseases, ultimately facilitating personalized medicine.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J
40132722,A review on the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks involved in inflammatory processes in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is the most frequent reason for dementia. Due to the increasing trend of aging in societies, it will place a large social and financial burden on society. Although beta amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are mentioned as the main events in this disorder, the exact molecular pathology and inflammatory regulatory networks involved in neuroinflammatory events, as a fundamental pathogenic mechanism remain unknown. Understanding these molecular network pathways in addition to helping to understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, can also help in the early diagnosis as well as the control of inflammatory processes that are involved in its progression. So, in this study, we intend to have an overview on the regulatory lncRNAs of Alzheimer's disease and their related miRNA and mRNAs, as well as the relationship of these regulatory pathways with inflammatory processes, so that we can provide a perspective for future studies in the field of diagnosis and possibly treatment of this disorder.",Brain Res

Cannabinoid-targeted therapies and imaging approaches have gained increasing interest; however, the biological impact of the endocannabinoid system in disease needs further validation. We aimed to study changes in cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), components of endocannabinoid signaling and degradation, in a mouse model of AD by PET imaging. Methods: [<sup>18</sup>F]FMPEP-d <sub>2</sub> and [<sup>18</sup>F]MAGL-2102 were produced on a commercial radiosynthesis module. PET-CT images with both tracers were acquired in a knock-in mouse model of AD bearing mutated human amyloid precursor protein (App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> ) at 3 ages, and compared to wild-type mice. Excised brains were used for in vitro autoradiography with [<sup>18</sup>F]FMPEP-d <sub>2</sub> and [<sup>18</sup>F]MAGL-2102, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Male wild-type and 5xFAD mice were chronically treated with MAGL inhibitor JZL184 and imaged with [<sup>18</sup>F]MAGL-2102 two days after ending treatment. Results: PET imaging showed sex-, age- and genotype-dependent changes in CB1 and MAGL availability. At 4-months (early-stage β-amyloid pathology), female App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice had lower CB1 availability, and MAGL availability was increased in male App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> <sub>,</sub> compared to wild-types<sub>.</sub> At 8-months, no genotype differences in CB1 were observed, yet MAGL availability was reduced in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> frontal cortex, and male App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice exhibited higher MAGL than transgenic females brain-wide. At 12-months (late-stage β-amyloid pathology), significantly lower uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]FMPEP-d <sub>2</sub> was observed in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> compared to wild-type, with no changes in [<sup>18</sup>F]MAGL-2102 binding. App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> plaque staging was confirmed by Thioflavin-S staining. Imaging findings were supplemented by autoradiography, immunofluorescence, and western blots. [<sup>18</sup>F]MAGL-2102 availability was responsive to target engagement of the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 in wild-type and 5xFAD mice. Conclusions: The present study showed dynamic age-, sex- and pathology-related changes in CB1 and MAGL availability from early-stage β-amyloid pathology, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system is a useful target for diagnostics and treatment of AD. Finally, these results highlight that endocannabinoid sex differences should be considered in diagnostics and drug development.",Theranostics
40080630,A network-level transport model of tau progression in the Alzheimer's brain.,"One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and spread of toxic aggregates of tau protein. The progression of AD tau pathology is thought to be highly stereotyped, which is in part due to the fact that tau can spread between regions via the white matter tracts that connect them. Mathematically, this phenomenon has been described using models of ""network diffusion,"" where the rate of spread of tau between brain regions is proportional to its concentration gradient and the amount of white matter between them. Although these models can robustly predict the progression of pathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, an underexplored aspect of tau spreading is that it is governed not simply by diffusion but also active transport along axonal microtubules. Spread can therefore take on a directional bias, resulting in distinct patterns of deposition, but current models struggle to capture this phenomenon. Recently, we have developed a mathematical model of the axonal transport of toxic tau proteins that takes into account the effects tau exerts on the molecular motors. Here we describe and implement a macroscopic version of this model, which we call the Network Transport Model (NTM). A key feature of this model is that, while it predicts tau dynamics at a regional level, it is parameterized in terms of only microscopic processes such as aggregation and transport rates; that is, differences in brain-wide tau progression can be explained by its microscopic properties. We provide numerical evidence that, as with the two-neuron model that the NTM extends, there are distinct and rich dynamics with respect to the overall rate of spread and the staging of pathology when we simulated the NTM on the hippocampal subnetwork. The theoretical insights provided by the NTM have broad implications for understanding AD pathophysiology more generally.",Math Med Biol
40123639,"Influence of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and diagnostic factors on financial capacity: A longitudinal analysis of the ADNI cohort.","INTRODUCTION: Financial capacity (FC) is the ability to independently manage finances in a manner consistent with one's self-interest. To investigate the relationship between FC, cognitive domains, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and transitions from normal cognition (cognitive normal [CN]) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted a secondary analysis of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using the Financial Capacity Instrument short form (FCI-SF).
METHODS: To examine these longitudinal relationships, we fit two models, a random effects (random intercept) ""time-averaged"" model and a ""time since previous visit"" model, where we regressed each of the five component financial scores on each of the cognitive composite scores. To examine the effect of baseline FCI-SF performance on conversion rates from normal to MCI or AD, we computed a survival model.
RESULTS: A total of 874 participants (diagnostic group, N, mean age: CN: 501, 74.4; MCI: 319, 74.6; and AD 54, 74.9) were included in the analyses. In time since previous visit models, we found that lower executive function composite scores were related to decline in the complex checkbook score (ß = 1.35 (0.55), p = 0.016) and total completion time of the FCI-SF (ß = 1.85 (9.36), p = 0.025). In addition, lower composite visuospatial score was significantly related to poorer performance on financial conceptual knowledge, complex checkbook, and total completion time. Lower composite memory score was highly related to decline in financial conceptual knowledge, single checkbook, and bank statement subscale scores. ADNI participants in the lowest tertile of total completion time, at any point in time, were four times more likely to receive a diagnosis of MCI or AD compared to participants in the highest tertile with a hazard ratio of 4.22 ([2.29] p = 008).
DISCUSSION: There is a multifaceted interaction between poorer cognition and everyday financial function where executive function, memory, and visuospatial cognition are related to FC. The strongest predictor of conversion from normal to either MCI or AD, appears to be time to completion.
HIGHLIGHTS: Decline in financial capacity (FC) is observed during transition to dementia and increases the risk of negative outcomes.Executive function, memory, and visuospatial cognition are related to FC.The strongest predictor of conversion from normal to either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) is time to completion or processing speed.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
40143686,The Current Research Landscape on the Machine Learning Application in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Bibliometric Analysis From 1999 to 2023.,"BACKGROUND: Language deficits, restricted and repetitive interests, and social difficulties are among the characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Machine learning and neuroimaging have also been combined to examine ASD. Utilizing bibliometric analysis, this study examines the current state and hot topics in machine learning for ASD.
OBJECTIVE: A research bibliometric analysis of the machine learning application in ASD trends, including research trends and the most popular topics, as well as proposed future directions for research.
METHODS: From 1999 to 2023, the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was searched for publications relating to machine learning and ASD. Authors, articles, journals, institutions, and countries were characterized using Microsoft Excel 2021 and VOSviewer. Analysis of knowledge networks, collaborative maps, hotspots, and trends was conducted using VOSviewer and CiteSpace.
RESULTS: A total of 1357 papers were identified between 1999 and 2023. There was a slow growth in publications until 2016; then, between 2017 and 2023, a sharp increase was recorded. Among the most important contributors to this field were the United States, China, India, and England. Among the top major research institutions with numerous publications were Stanford University, Harvard Medical School, the University of California, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Wall, Dennis P. was the most productive and highest-cited author. Scientific Reports, Frontiers In Neuroscience Autism Research, and Frontiers In Psychiatry were the three productive journals. ""autism spectrum disorder"", ""machine learning"", ""children"", ""classification"" and ""deep learning"" are the central topics in this period.
CONCLUSION: Cooperation and communication between countries/regions need to be enhanced in future research. A shift is taking place in the research hotspot from ""Alzheimer's Disease"", ""Mild Cognitive Impairment"" and ""cortex"" to ""artificial intelligence"", ""deep learning"", ""electroencephalography"" and ""pediatrics"". Crowdsourcing machine learning applications and electroencephalography for ASD diagnosis should be the future development direction. Future research about these hot topics would promote understanding in this field.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40034343,Identifying shared diagnostic genes and mechanisms in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease via bioinformatics and machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) share overlapping pathophysiological characteristics, yet comparative genetic studies are rare. Understanding these overlaps may aid in identifying common diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.
OBJECTIVE: This study identifies shared diagnostic genes and mechanisms linking AD and VaD.
METHODS: Datasets GSE5281 and GSE122063 from the GEO database were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Intersection DEGs were analyzed using KEGG and GO enrichment to explore signaling pathways. A PPI network was constructed, and LASSO and SVM-RFE were applied to identify core genes. CIBERSORT assessed immune cell composition and their relationship with core genes. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using ROC curves, nomogram, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Core genes were used to identify characteristic genes in various brain regions of AD patients.
RESULTS: The analysis identified 9021 DEGs for AD and 373 DEGs for VaD, with 74 co-expressed genes and 8 core genes. ROC curves, nomogram, and DCA indicated high diagnostic accuracy. Core gene analysis revealed differential expression of characteristic genes in various brain regions of AD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This research identified 74 co-expressed genes and 8 pivotal diagnostic genes. These genes likely play roles in signal transduction, neuroinflammation, and autophagy in both AD and VaD. The findings offer potential targets for future research and clinical interventions. Further research should use larger, more diverse datasets and incorporate custom NGS panels to identify novel genetic variants, enhancing precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
39987858,Multi-atlas multi-modality morphometry analysis of the South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center postmortem repository.,"Histopathology provides critical insights into the neurological processes inducing neurodegenerative diseases and their impact on the brain, but brain banks combining histology and neuroimaging data are difficult to create. As part of an ongoing global effort to establish new brain banks providing both high-quality neuroimaging scans and detailed histopathology examinations, the South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Re- search Center postmortem repository was recently created with the specific purpose of studying comorbid dementias. As the repository is reaching a milestone of two hundred brain donations and a hundred curated MRI sessions are ready for processing, robust statistical analyses can now be conducted. In this work, we report the very first morphometry analysis conducted with this new data set. We describe the processing pipelines that were specifically developed to exploit the available MRI sequences, and we explain how we addressed several postmortem neuroimaging challenges, such as the separation of brain tissues from fixative fluids, the need for updated brain atlases, and the tissue contrast changes induced by brain fixation. In general, our results establish that a combination of structural MRI sequences can provide enough informa- tion for state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms to almost perfectly separate brain tissues from a formalin buffered solution. Regional brain volumes are challenging to measure in postmortem scans, but robust estimates sensitive to sex differences and age trends, reflecting clinical diagnosis, neuropathology findings, and the shrinkage induced by tissue fixation can be obtained. We hope that the new processing methods developed in this work, such as the lightweight Deep Networks we used to identify the formalin signal in multimodal MRI scans and the MRI synthesis tools we used to fix our anisotropic resolution brain scans, will inspire other research teams working with postmortem MRI scans.",Neuroimage Clin
40076550,Hesperetin-Enhanced Metformin to Alleviate Cognitive Impairment via Gut-Brain Axis in Type 2 Diabetes Rats.,"Diabetes constitutes a risk factor for cognitive impairment, whereas insulin resistance serves as the shared pathogenesis underlying both diabetes and cognitive decline. The use of metformin for treating cognitive impairment remains controversial. The present study found that hesperetin, a flavanone derived from citrus peel, enhanced metformin's efficacy in reducing blood sugar levels, improving insulin sensitivity, and ameliorating cognitive impairment in diabetic rats. Additionally, it reduced the required dosage of metformin to one-third of its conventional dose. Transcriptome analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the activation of insulin and cyclic-adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathways benefited from the regulation of gut microbiota and the promotion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers such as Romboutsia. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that hesperetin supplementation counteracted the upregulation of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a pathological factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that was induced by metformin. Our findings reveal that hesperetin can be used in supplementary treatment for cognitive impairment associated with diabetes.",Int J Mol Sci
40082954,Probe-dependent Proximity Profiling (ProPPr) Uncovers Similarities and Differences in Phospho-Tau-Associated Proteomes Between Tauopathies.,"BACKGROUND: Tauopathies represent a diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the abnormal aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying the diversity of neuronal and glial tau pathology in different tauopathies are poorly understood. While there is a growing understanding of tauopathy-specific differences in tau isoforms and fibrillar structures, the specific composition of heterogenous tau lesions remains unknown. Here we study the protein composition of tau aggregates in four major tauopathies: Alzheimer's disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
METHODS: We developed an approach for in situ proximity labeling and isolation of aggregate-associated proteins using glass slides with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human postmortem brain tissue, termed Probe-dependent Proximity Profiling (ProPPr). We used ProPPr for the analysis of proteomes associated with AT8-positive cellular lesions from frontal cortices. Isolated proximity proteomes were analyzed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Co-immunofluorescence staining and quantitative data analysis for selected proteins in human brain tissue was performed to further investigate associations with diverse tau pathologies.
RESULTS: Proteomics data analysis identified numerous common and tauopathy-specific proteins associated with phospho-tau aggregates. Extensive validations of candidates through quantitative immunofluorescence imaging of distinct aggregates across disease cases demonstrate successful implementation of ProPPr for unbiased discovery of aggregate-associated proteins in in human brain tissue. Our results reveal the association of retromer complex component vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35) and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) with specific types of phospho-tau lesions in tauopathies. Furthermore, we discovered a disease-specific association of certain proteins with distinct pathological lesions, including glycogen synthase kinase alpha (GSK3α), ferritin light chain (FTL), and the neuropeptide precursor VGF. Notably, the identification of FTL-positive microglia in CBD astrocytic plaques indicate their potential role in the pathogenesis of these lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the suitability of the ProPPr approach in FFPE brain tissue for unbiased discovery of local proteomes that provide valuable insights into the underlying proteomic landscape of tauopathies, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology. This first comprehensive characterization of tau-associated proteomes in a range of distinct tauopathies enhances our understanding of disease heterogeneity and mechanisms, informing strategies for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies.",Mol Neurodegener

40034368,Exploring causal relationship of traumatic brain injury and comorbidities: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies demonstrated a link existed between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cerebral disease and multisystem complications, such as dementia, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal disease, but they could be confused by confounding and reverse causality.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to figure out the causal correlation between TBI and the following complications.
METHODS: Database concerning TBI and complications from genome-wide association study (GWAS) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to examine whether TBI was causally associated with the risk of some complications. All the analysis was carried out through R, version 4.3.3.
RESULTS: MR analyses indicated that any dementia has a promotional effect on TBI (OR = 1.067, 95% CI, 1.011-1.123, p = 0.017). However, there was no causal genetically association between TBI and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), pneumonia, or gastrointestinal disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to observational studies, our results uncovered little causal association between TBI and PD, AD, depression, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal diseases. Interestingly, we found any dementia might be the risk of TBI, which was a new discovery.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40011632,Rhynchophylline alleviates cognitive deficits in multiple transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease via modulating neuropathology and gut microbiota.,"Amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, phosphorylated tau accumulation and neuroinflammation are considered as three hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rhynchophylline (RN), the major alkaloid of a Chinese medicinal plant Uncaria rhynchophylla, has been shown to possess potent anti-AD effects. This study explored the effects of RN on Aβ pathology, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation using three AD mouse models, including TgCRND8, 3×Tg-AD, and 5×FAD, with RN treatment lasting for 4, 6, and 6 months, respectively, followed by behavioral tests and biological assays. In addition, BV2 cells were employed to further evaluate the biological effects of RN. RN treatment improved cognitive functions by reducing anxiety-like behaviors, enhancing recognition ability, and ameliorating learning impairments. It modulated Aβ processing through reducing the Aβ-producing enzyme activities and enhancing degradation enzyme activities, thereby diminishing Aβ accumulation. RN also decreased hyperphosphorylated tau proteins at Thr181, Thr205, Ser396, and Ser404 sites. Moreover, RN diminished neuroinflammation by reducing microglia and astrocyte activation and lowering the release of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, RN treatment could restore gut microbiota dysbiosis in 5×FAD mice. In BV2 cells, knockdown of p53, HDAC2, and Galectin-3 markedly enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects of RN. Overall, the anti-AD properties of RN were attributed to its regulation of multiple biological pathways, including regulation of the p53/PINK1 signaling pathway, inhibition of the HDAC2/AMPK signaling pathway, suppression of the Galectin-3/C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway, and modulation of gut microflora dysbiosis. This pioneering study unambiguously revealed the effects of RN on cognitive impairments, APP processing, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation in different transgenic mouse models with differing AD burdens, highlighting its potential as an anti-AD therapeutic agent and enhancing the scientific basis for its clinical use in treating AD.",Acta Pharmacol Sin
40022313,Depolymerized peanut skin-derived proanthocyanidins alleviate cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting Aβ42 aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Peanut skin proanthocyanidins (PSP) are natural polyphenols with antioxidant properties that mitigate Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose underlying biological mechanisms includes the aggregation of insoluble amyloid plaques. However, the high degree of polymerization of PSP, extracted using conventional methods, limits its bioavailability. This study established the optimal processes for ultrasound-assisted alkaline depolymerization to produce oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPSP) from PSP content (2.7 mg/mL), depolymerization temperature (54.8 °C), ultrasonic power (480 W, 28 Hz), ultrasonic duration (28.7 min), and pH (12.1). Under these conditions, the degree of polymerization of the proanthocyanidins decreased from 6.74 to 2.87. Physicochemical characteristics of PSP and OPSP were analyzed. Both PSP and OPSP exhibited shared structural bonding and a repeating 288 Da unit, with Proanthocyanidin A identified as the predominant type. Furthermore, compared with PSP, OPSP demonstrated enhanced stability and antioxidant activity. Using in vitro detection of amyloid-beta (Aβ42) inhibition, this study demonstrated that OPSP exhibited greater inhibition of Aβ42 fibrillogenicity than underpolymerized PSP, and OPSP significantly inhibited Aβ42-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, the effect of OPSP was investigated in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The results indicated that OPSP improved the memory performance of AD rats in the water maze and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Moreover, OPSP ameliorated histopathological changes and reduced Aβ42 plaque deposition in the brains of AD rats. These findings regarding OPSP are anticipated to facilitate high-value utilization of peanut by-products, expand their applications, and provide guidance for the use of OPSP in the development of natural healthcare pharmaceuticals and mitigation and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Food Res Int
39984555,Nebulized seabuckthorn seed oil inhalation attenuates Alzheimer's disease progression in APP/PS1 mice.,"Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is known for its medicinal properties in treating various diseases, including neurological conditions. However, the therapeutic effect of inhaled seabuckthorn seed oil (SSO) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains not fully understood. This study explores the effects of nebulized inhalation of SSO in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice over 21 days. The results showed that nebulized SSO improved memory and cognition. Using 7.0T MRI to monitor blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals revealed that SSO altered the Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) signaling such as in the amygdala and substantia innominate, and hippocampus. Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and pathological analyses indicated reduced neuroinflammation in plasma and brain, decreased neuronal necrosis, lower β-amyloid (Aβ) protein levels, reduced amyloid deposition, and increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Additionally, SSO promoted gut microbiota remodeling by increasing alpha diversity and boosting levels of probiotics such as Verrucomicrobia, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Akkermansia, without adverse effects on lung tissue. Nebulized inhalation of SSO may slow AD progression by modulating inflammation and amyloid deposition. Nebulized inhalation offered a potential method for enhancing drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier with reduced systemic side effects.",Sci Rep
40095069,Biofluid-based staging of Alzheimer's disease.,"Recently, conceptual systems for the in vivo staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using fluid biomarkers have been suggested. Thus, it is important to assess whether available fluid biomarkers can successfully stage AD into clinically and biologically relevant categories. In the TRIAD cohort, we explored whether p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau (biomarkers of early, intermediate and late AD pathology, respectively) have potential for biofluid-based staging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 219) and plasma (n = 150), and compared them in a paired CSF and plasma subset (n = 76). Our findings suggest a good concordance between biofluid staging and underlying pathology when classifying amyloid-positivity into three categories based on neurofibrillary pathology: minimal/non-existent (p-tau217 positive), early-to-intermediate (p-tau217 and p-tau205 positivity), and advanced tau tangle deposition (p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau positive), as indexed by tau-PET. Discordant cases accounted for 4.6% and 13.3% of all CSF and plasma measurements respectively (9.2% and 11.8% in paired samples). Notably, CSF- and plasma-based staging matched one another in 61.7% of the cases, while approximately 32% of the remaining participants were one to three biofluid stages higher in CSF as compared to plasma. Overall, these exploratory results suggest that biofluid staging of AD holds potential for offering valuable insights into underlying AD hallmarks and disease severity. However, its applicability beyond molecular characterization at research settings has yet to be demonstrated.",Acta Neuropathol
40111924,Biomarkers do not paint the whole picture: The role of clinical expertise and advanced neuroimaging for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Memory Clinics remains challenging due to the limited specificity of conventional clinical assessment and structural imaging. The recent commentary by Vyhnalek and colleagues advocates for the incorporation of molecular biomarkers for AD diagnosis in clinical practice. However, this approach only partially captures the complexity of disease expression due to co-pathologies such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, a mimic of AD. At the era of immunotherapy for AD, clinical expertise remains essential to identify AD from its mimics, especially when both entities co-exist, and may rely on advanced neuroimaging techniques such as brain connectivity.",J Alzheimers Dis
40138441,Investigation of risk of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and survival based on variation to life experiences used to operationalize cognitive reserve.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease dementia (AD) is a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disease. Life experiences are hypothesized to build cognitive reserve (CR), a theoretical construct associated with delayed onset of AD symptoms. While CR is a key moderator of cognitive decline, operationalization of CR is varied resulting in inconsistencies within the literature.ObjectiveThis study explored the relationship between life experiences used as proxies of CR and risk of AD diagnosis and death following diagnosis.MethodsWe explored results based on 30 different published CR operationalizations, including two standardized questionnaires and an investigator-developed lifecourse indicator. Using data from the Memory and Aging Project, we applied Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the impact of operationalization on time to outcomes.ResultsHazard ratios, indicating instantaneous risk of AD or death for a standard deviation increase in the CR proxy utilized as a predictor, ranged from 0.80-1.40 for AD diagnosis and 0.80-1.29 for death following diagnosis. Among nine predictors that showed a significant reduction in risk of AD, there was a decrease of between 12% and 20%. Two predictors were associated with reduced risk of death, with 13%-20% reduction, while three predictors were associated with 18%-22% heightened risk of death following diagnosis.ConclusionsModel results were highly sensitive to CR operationalization. Based on the variation in results, composite measures that incorporate multiple lifecourse variables may still be the most comprehensive and faithful representation of CR. Attention to methodology and refining of measurement are needed to make use of CR and promote healthy aging.",J Alzheimers Dis
40067740,Structure of the CD33 Receptor and Implications for the Siglec Family.,"In the innate immune system, the CD33 receptor modulates microglial activity. Its downregulation promises to slow Alzheimer's disease, and it is already targeted in blood cancers. The mechanism underlying CD33 signaling is unresolved. Starting from the available crystal structure of its extracellular IgV-IgC1 domains, we have assembled a model of the human CD33 receptor by characterizing the oligomerization and structure of IgC1, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains in solution. IgC1 homodimerizes via intermolecular β-strand pairing and packing. In contrast, the 21-residue transmembrane helix of CD33 appears monomeric and straight, with a conserved thin neck and thick belly appearance followed by a positively charged cytosolic patch. The cytosolic domain is dynamically unstructured. Sequence alignment and AlphaFold models indicate that IgC domains in the family of human Siglecs, to which CD33 belongs, are surprisingly variable. Only Siglec-6 is identified to analogously dimerize via IgC1. Our CD33 structural model suggests that the receptor is not signaling via a monomer-dimer shift. Rather, we propose that, aided but also constrained by dimerization, multivalent ligands may concentrate the receptor transmembrane and cytosolic domains sufficiently to trigger colocalization with an activating kinase.",Biochemistry
40130281,The Role of Glial Cell Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Glial cell senescence, characterized by the irreversible arrest of cell division and a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, has emerged as a critical player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (ad). While much attention has been devoted to the role of neurons in ad, growing evidence suggests that glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, contribute significantly to disease progression through senescence. In this review, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying glial cell senescence in ad, focusing on the cellular signaling pathways, including DNA damage response and the accumulation of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP). We also examine how senescent glial cells exacerbate neuroinflammation, disrupt synaptic function, and promote neuronal death in ad. Moreover, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting glial cell senescence to mitigate the neurodegenerative processes in ad. By providing a comprehensive overview of current research on glial cell senescence in Alzheimer's disease, this review highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic target in the fight against ad.",J Neurochem

40127821,"Neurotrophic factor neuritin ameliorates streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease-like impairment of memory, neuroinflammation, apoptotic factors and compensates hippocampal neuritin expression.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly, and is becoming one of the most expensive and deadly diseases. Deficiency of neurotrophic factors signaling is an important cause of this disease. Therefore, we investigated whether neuritin as a neurotrophic factor can have a neuroprotective effect against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD. The animals were bilaterally injected with intra hippocampal-STZ (3 mg/kg). Different concentrations of neuritin (0.5, 1, 1.5 µg/rat) were administrated 15 min before STZ injection. After 14 days, the rats were evaluated for cognitive performance using novel object recognition (NOR), open field and Morris water maze (MWM) tests and then sacrificed for biochemical analysis (by real-time PCR and western blot examinations). The results demonstrated that the STZ- induced learning and memory impairments were significantly prevented by 1.5 µg neuritin. Moreover, the increased levels of inflammatory factors (NF-κb, TNF-α and IL-1β) and apoptotic parameters (cytochrome c and caspase‑3) in STZ- treated rats were also significantly decreased by neuritin. In addition, hippocampal neuritin gene expression was downregulated by STZ injection, which was reversed by intra hippocampal neuritin injection. In conclusion, the present study suggests that neuritin prevents cognitive defects in AD rat model and its expression level is associated with cognitive resilience.",Behav Brain Res
40042687,Ferulago angulata Extract Protects against Beta-amyloid-induced Memory Impairment Through Modulation of Monoaminoxidase Enzymes in the Rat's Hippocampus.,"Ferulago angulata, a medicinal plant of the Apiaceae family, is known for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects. This study investigated the protective potential of F. angulata total extract against memory impairment induced by amyloid β-peptide (Aβ25-35) in rats. Aβ25-35 was bilaterally administered into the CA1 region of the hippocampus in male Wistar rats for four consecutive days. Starting from the first surgery day, rats received oral treatment with F. angulata extract (400 mg/kg) or Rivastigmine (1.5 mg/kg) for 16 consecutive days. Morris water maze tests conducted from days 14 to 17 evaluated the learning and memory performance, followed by biochemical and molecular assays on isolated hippocampi. F. angulata extract significantly reversed Aβ-induced deficits in learning and memory. In the Aβ group, monoamine oxidase A and B enzyme activities and gene expression increased, along with elevated acetylcholinesterase gene expression but decreased enzyme activity compared to the control group. Treatment with F. angulata extract mitigated all these abnormalities. Safety assessments revealed no alterations in blood biochemistry or histology following F. angulata extract treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that F. angulata extract possesses neuroprotective properties, and ameliorates Aβ-induced memory deficits by modulating monoamine oxidase enzyme activity and acetylcholinesterase levels without significant adverse effects. Thus, this safe herbal extract shows promise for further exploration in Alzheimer's disease research and potential therapeutic interventions.",Neurochem Res
40034362,How to assess cognitive decline when test administration changes across study waves? Harmonizing cognitive scores across waves in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.,"BACKGROUND: Conducting longitudinal cognitive analyses is an essential part of understanding the underlying mechanism of Alzheimer's disease, especially for social and health behavior determinants. However, the cognitive test administration is highly likely to change across time and thus complicate the longitudinal analyses. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study assessed memory through word recall tests across five study waves from 2011 to 2020. Since 2018, changes in the test stimuli and administration posed challenges for longitudinal cognitive analyses.
OBJECTIVE: To address differences in administration and to preserve differences attributed to characteristics such as age and education and to derive equated scores for use in longitudinal analyses in CHARLS.
METHODS: To ensure consistent underlying test ability across waves in the full sample (N = 19,364), we derived a calibration sample (N = 11,148) balancing age, gender, and education. Within this sample, we used weighted equipercentile equating to crosswalk percentile ranks between 2015 and 2018/2020 scores, then applied the algorithm to the full sample.
RESULTS: Mean original delayed word recall was higher in 2018 (4.3 words) and 2020 (5.1 words) versus 2015 (3.2 words). Following equating, scores in 2018 and 2020 aligned better with previous waves (2015, 2018, 2020 immediate means: 4.1, 3.6, 4.0; delayed: 3.2, 2.4, 2.9 words).
CONCLUSIONS: Equipercentile equating enables the derivation of comparable scores, facilitating longitudinal analysis when cognitive test administration procedures change over time. We recommended the use of equated scores for longitudinal analyses using CHARLS cognitive data.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40116949,Behavioural and cognitive profiles in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study.,"INTRODUCTION: Longitudinal comparative characterisation of dementia syndromes may aid differential diagnosis, prognostication and intervention implementation.
METHODS: We compared the behavioural and cognitive characteristics of 84 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 29 left and 14 right-dominant semantic dementia (SDL and SDR) and 49 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients over a follow-up period of 2.4 ± 1.6 years using the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory Revised (CBI-R) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination third edition (ACE-III).
RESULTS: Linear mixed modelling of time effects found progression of all CBI-R domains, aside from sleep, beliefs and mood domains, and all ACE-III domains. Modelling of group effects found that bvFTD had greater symptoms than AD in most CBI-R domains. Notably, SDL and SDR compared differently with AD and bvFTD; whilst SDR did not differ significantly from bvFTD in any CBI-R domain, SDL had less severe symptoms than bvFTD in everyday skills, motivation, sleep and eating habits; whilst SDL had greater disturbances in abnormal behaviour and stereotypic behaviour than AD, SDR had greater disturbances in addition in motivation and eating habits. Motivation, eating habits, abnormal behaviour and stereotypic behaviour were the most frequently different behavioural domains between groups.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that the combined, longitudinal use of existing behavioural and cognitive assessments could capture distinct clinical profiles of common and rare dementia syndromes. Our findings also highlight the importance of select behavioural domains such as motivation and the usefulness of separate clinical characterisations of SDL and SDR.",J Neurol
40166792,Blood-Based β-Amyloid and Phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review of Their Diagnostic Potential.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathological features such as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) tangles. Blood-based biomarkers of Aβ and p-Tau have emerged as promising tools for early diagnosis, monitoring, and risk stratification of AD. This systematic review evaluates current evidence on the diagnostic utility of Aβ and p-Tau blood biomarkers in AD. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2011 and 2024. This review synthesizes findings from 33 peer-reviewed studies to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of these biomarkers. Results demonstrate that blood Aβ and p-Tau levels strongly correlate with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuroimaging measures of AD pathology. Among the biomarkers analyzed, p-Tau (including p-Tau181 and p-Tau217) consistently exhibited superior diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal individuals. The combination of Aβ and p-Tau biomarkers further improved diagnostic precision, supporting their complementary roles in AD pathology detection. Despite promising findings, significant heterogeneity among studies underscores the need for assay standardization, validation in diverse populations, and longitudinal research to establish clinical utility. This study concludes that blood-based Aβ and p-Tau biomarkers represent a significant advance in AD diagnostics, offering non-invasive, cost-effective, and scalable solutions for early detection and therapeutic monitoring.",Cureus
39999530,DCARD checklist: A simple screening tool for Lewy body disease-related early symptoms in memory clinic.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the relatively high prevalence of Lewy body disease (LBD) in over middle-aged people, physicians and patients show poor awareness of early symptoms. We examined the clinical utility of a simple checklist for screening for the early symptoms of LBD.
METHODS: We administered a 7-item screening checklist assessing the five representative early symptoms of LBD (dizziness, constipation, anosmia, REM sleep behavior disorder, and depression: the acronym is ""DCARD"") to 450 consecutive individuals who visited the memory clinic at our university hospital. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of the DCARD checklist in differentiating neurocognitive disorders (NCD) due to LBD (i.e., NCD with Lewy bodies and NCD due to Parkinson's disease) from NCD due to non-LBD (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). We also associated the DCARD score with current depressive symptoms using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15).
RESULTS: Fifty-five participants (12.2 %) had a higher DCARD score (≥4 out of 7 points) regardless of the global cognitive level. The subgroup with higher DCARD scores had higher GDS-15 scores than the subgroup with lower DCARD scores (p < 0.001). With a DCARD cut-off score of 3/4, the sensitivity and specificity were 65 % and 95 %, respectively, for diagnosing NCD due to LBDs. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed good discriminatory ability (area under the curve: 0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: This simple LBD screening checklist may be useful as a diagnostic tool for the early diagnosis of LBD in memory clinics.

40111920,Differences between East and West may affect dementia studies: Thoughts from the KSA dementia prevalence study.,"While science is the same in the East and West, certain personal characteristics may distort scientific results. This is more likely in the East. An example may be a recent project in the East that measured the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia in a very large group. They found it to be near 1%, which seems very low. Studies that show a low prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia could be due to an examination of a very healthy group with very few older people, and/or poor/inaccurate testing (none of which were in this study). Another possibility is that the person, their family or their doctor aim at ignoring or hiding a diagnosis of dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis
40086955,Small intestine-residing probiotics suppress neurotoxic bile acid production via extracellular vesicle-mediated inhibition of Clostridium scindens.,"Dysbiosis in gut microbiota and abnormalities in bile acids have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. While many studies have focused on the relationship between colonic bacteria and Alzheimer's disease (AD), this study propose that alterations in the small intestine microbiota may play a more critical role. This is because the small intestine is pivotal in recycling bile acids through enterohepatic circulation. This study uses amyloid precursor protein knock-in (APP<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup>) transgenic mice to investigate the association between intestinal microbiota and bile acid metabolism. The results showed that the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) leads to a significant decrease in Lactobacillus johnsonii and a notable increase in bacteria of the genus Clostridium in the small intestine, which are important microorganisms for producing toxic bile acids. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) involved in bacterial interactions and bacteria-host interactions are currently a focus of research. Treatment with L. johnsonii-derived EVs at concentrations of 10<sup>10</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup>/mL) inhibited the growth of Clostridium scindens and suppressed the production of toxic secondary lithocholic acid (TLA) at non-cytotoxic concentrations (10<sup>8</sup>/mL). Furthermore, the removal of small RNA from L. johnsonii-derived EVs resulted in the loss of their ability to suppress TLA production. These results suggest that the small intestine microbiota may play a more critical role than the colonic microbiota in AD. Deterioration of small intestine microbiota led to the metabolism disruption of certain secondary bile acids, which have been reported to exacerbate AD pathology. The EVs released by L. johnsonii, which is abundant in the small intestine, can suppress toxic TLA and have the potential to be developed into health-promoting probiotics.",Food Res Int
40009301,Unveiling the mTOR pathway modulation by SGLT2 inhibitors: a novel approach to Alzheimer's disease in type 2 diabetes.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition causing cognitive deterioration, leading to severe consequences. As the global prevalence of AD increases, new treatment approaches are needed to supplement current conventional therapies, as traditional treatments are not meeting the increasing demand for alternative treatments. It is increasingly evident that treating metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus, obesity, and AD by blocking mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling is advantageous. Chronic mTOR activation may cause AD's metabolic, lysosomal, and mitochondrial dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid plaque development, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier through endothelial cell malfunction. Chronic glucose loss through sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitions can restore mTOR cycling, potentially halting or slowing AD pathogenesis. Chronic activation of mTOR is implicated in pathophysiological aspects of AD, such as metabolic dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid plaque formation, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. SGLT-2 inhibitors, commonly used in treating Type 2 Diabetes, have been shown to reduce mTOR activation and restore circadian regularity, a new finding in cognitive decline and metabolic disorders. Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors decrease oxidative damage, inflammation, insulin signaling pathways, and proliferation of endothelial cells to enhance vascular tone, flexibility, and contractility. Along with reducing the formation of plaque containing amyloid and improving brain function, neural plasticity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, damage to the brain, and cognitive decline, they also regulate the mTOR pathway in the brain. Thus, repurposing SGLT-2 inhibitors, primarily used in diabetes treatment, presents a promising avenue for changing the way that AD is managed. The purpose of this review was to focus on the mTOR signalling cascade of SGLT 2 inhibitors to AD management in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus.",Metab Brain Dis
40011826,CSEPC: a deep learning framework for classifying small-sample multimodal medical image data in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts health care worldwide, particularly among the elderly population. The accurate classification of AD stages is essential for slowing disease progression and guiding effective interventions. However, limited sample sizes continue to present a significant challenge in classifying the stages of AD progression. Addressing this obstacle is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and optimizing treatment strategies for those affected by AD.
METHODS: In this study, we proposed cross-scale equilibrium pyramid coupling (CSEPC), which is a novel diagnostic algorithm designed for small-sample multimodal medical imaging data. CSEPC leverages scale equilibrium theory and modal coupling properties to integrate semantic features from different imaging modalities and across multiple scales within each modality. The architecture first extracts balanced multiscale features from structural MRI (sMRI) data and functional MRI (fMRI) data using a cross-scale pyramid module. These features are then combined through a contrastive learning-based cosine similarity coupling mechanism to capture intermodality associations effectively. This approach enhances the representation of both inter- and intramodal features while significantly reducing the number of learning parameters, making it highly suitable for small sample environments. We validated the effectiveness of the CSEPC model through experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and demonstrated its superior performance in diagnosing and staging AD.
RESULTS: Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model matches or exceeds the performance of models used in previous studies in AD classification. Specifically, the model achieved an accuracy of 85.67% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 in classifying the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. To further validate its effectiveness, we used our method to diagnose different stages of AD. In both classification tasks, our approach delivered superior performance.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the performance of our model in various tasks has demonstrated its significant potential in the field of small-sample multimodal medical imaging classification, particularly AD classification. This advancement could significantly assist clinicians in effectively managing and intervening in the disease progression of patients with early-stage AD.",BMC Geriatr
39995102,Diagnostic role of circulating cell-free DNA in schizophrenia and neuro-degenerative disorders.,"Over the past few years, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) research has grown exponentially. Several studies have associated the release of cfDNA in the bloodstream, cerebrospinal fluid, and other body fluids with increased apoptosis and cell death. Therefore, their possible use as biomarkers for cancer and other diseases has emerged. The diagnosis of pathological entities such as schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases involves many challenges and requires ruling out conditions with similar symptoms. In this context, cfDNA could serve as a valuable diagnostic biomarker. This study encompasses the recent bibliography and research regarding the utilization of circulating cfDNA for diagnostic purposes in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. This minimally invasive method has provided important evidence regarding the diagnosis of the aforementioned diseases although further research is necessary.",Biomark Med
40145102,Shallow-angle intracranial cannula for repeated infusion and in vivo imaging with multiphoton microscopy.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Multiphoton microscopy serves as an essential tool for high-resolution imaging of the living mouse brain. To facilitate optical access to the brain during imaging, cranial window surgery is commonly used. However, this procedure restricts physical access above the imaging area and hinders the direct delivery of imaging agents and chemical compounds to the brain.
AIM: We aim to develop a method that allows the repeated administration of imaging agents and compounds to the mouse brain while performing in vivo imaging with multiphoton microscopy.
APPROACH: We have developed a cannula delivery system that enables the implantation of a low-profile cannula nearly parallel to the brain surface at angles as shallow as 8 deg while maintaining compatibility with multiphoton microscopy.
RESULTS: To validate our shallow-angle cannula approach, we performed direct infusion and imaging of various fluorescent cell markers in the brain. In addition, we successfully demonstrated tracking of degenerating neurons over time in Alzheimer's disease mice using Fluoro-Jade C. Furthermore, we showed longitudinal imaging of the partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue using a phosphorescent oxygen sensor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our developed technique should enable a wide range of longitudinal imaging studies in the mouse brain.",Neurophotonics
40103927,Comparing machine learning classifier models in discriminating cognitively unimpaired older adults from three clinical cohorts in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum: demonstration analyses in the COMPASS-ND study.,"BACKGROUND: Research in aging, impairment, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) often requires powerful computational models for discriminating between clinical cohorts and identifying early biomarkers and key risk or protective factors. Machine Learning (ML) approaches represent a diverse set of data-driven tools for performing such tasks in big or complex datasets. We present systematic demonstration analyses to compare seven frequently used ML classifier models and two eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques on multiple performance metrics for a common neurodegenerative disease dataset. The aim is to identify and characterize the best performing ML and XAI algorithms for the present data.
METHOD: We accessed a Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging dataset featuring four well-characterized cohorts: Cognitively Unimpaired (CU), Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD (N = 255). All participants contributed 102 multi-modal biomarkers and risk factors. Seven ML algorithms were compared along six performance metrics in discriminating between cohorts. Two XAI algorithms were compared using five performance and five similarity metrics.
RESULTS: Although all ML models performed relatively well in the extreme-cohort comparison (CU/AD), the Super Learner (SL), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient-Boosted trees (GB) algorithms excelled in the challenging near-cohort comparisons (CU/SCI). For the XAI interpretation comparison, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) generally outperformed Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanation (LIME) in key performance properties.
CONCLUSION: The ML results indicate that two tree-based methods (RF and GB) are reliable and effective as initial models for classification tasks involving discrete clinical aging and neurodegeneration data. In the XAI phase, SHAP performed better than LIME due to lower computational time (when applied to RF and GB) and incorporation of feature interactions, leading to more reliable results.",Front Aging Neurosci
40129418,Life-long music and dance relationships and therapeutic impressions in individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment to inform the design of music- and dance-based therapies.,"BackgroundNo effective therapies exist to prevent neurodegenerative mild cognitive impairment (MCI) related to Alzheimer's disease. Therapies integrating music and/or dance are promising non-pharmacological options to effectively mitigate cognitive decline.ObjectiveTo deepen our understanding of individuals' relationships (i.e., histories, experiences, and attitudes) with music and dance, in order to incorporate such knowledge into the design of music- and dance-based interventions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes.MethodsEleven older adults with MCI and five of their care partners/ spouses (4 M/12F; Black: n = 4, White: n = 10, Hispanic/Latino: n = 2; Age: 71.4 ± 9.6 years) first completed questionnaires, then participated in focus groups that captured aspects of their relationships with music and dance. Emergent themes were extracted from four major topics, including: (1) experience and history, (2) enjoyment and preferences, (3) confidence and barriers, and (4) impressions of music and dance as therapeutic tools.ResultsThematic analysis revealed participants' positive impressions of music and dance as potential therapeutic interventions, citing perceived neuropsychological, emotional, and physical benefits. Participants viewed music and dance as integral to their lives, histories, and identities within a culture, family, and/ or community. Participants also identified lifelong engagement barriers that, in conjunction with negative feedback, instilled persistent low self-efficacy regarding dancing and active music engagement. Questionnaires verified individuals' moderately-strong music and dance relationships, which were strongest in passive forms of music engagement (e.g., listening).ConclusionsOur findings support that individuals' music and dance relationships and the associated perceptions toward music and dance therapy may offer valuable insights that enhance the design of efficacious and engaging non-pharmacological therapies for individuals with MCI.",J Alzheimers Dis
40018942,How Histone Sensing Drives Alzheimer's Disease.,"The human DNA double helix is wrapped around proteins known as histones, which play a critical role in regulating gene expression. The goal of this opinion piece is to provide an overview of how histone sensing drives Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histones are proteins enriched in basic amino acids. Histone acetylation plays an important role in the progression of AD as its dysregulation can lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, abnormal histone acetylation, a post-translation modification, is a key factor in AD as it contributes to brain cell inflammatory pathology. Thus, higher levels of histone acetylation could potentially serve as important biomarkers for the progression of AD. Here, we report that increased levels of acetylation of histones H2B, H3, and H4 in the promoter regions of Tip60 lysine acetyltransferase protein, p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases, p300/CBP-associated factor, elongator protein 3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and Tau genes in the hippocampus and temporal lobe are associated with the development of AD-associated learning and memory impairment.",Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)
39995296,Natural Bioactive Compounds Solanesol and Chlorogenic Acid Assembled Nanomicelles for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.,"Solanesol (Sol) and chlorogenic acid (CHA) are naturally active compounds. Sol exhibits a significant free radical absorption ability and strong antioxidant activity. CHA, a typical phenolic acid, exhibits excellent anticancer, anti-inflammation, and antibacterial properties. Herein, bifunctional nanomicelles (CI@SPK) were skillfully designed to take advantage of the unique properties of Sol and CHA to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hydrophobic Sol was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) to self-assemble into stable nanomicelles (SP). CHA could be encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of these nanomicelles, which increased its bioavailability greatly. Short peptide K (CKLVFFAED) was incorporated (CI@SPK) to facilitate their crossing the blood-brain barrier. Then, CI@SPK targeted the AD lesion area, and CHA was released in greater quantities with the help of IR780 under irradiation with an 808 nm laser, resulting in synergistically scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) with Sol. Consequently, the nanomicelles CI@SPK demonstrated capabilities in scavenging ROS, inhibiting β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, and eventually modulating microglia phenotype from M1 to M2 to promote Aβ phagocytosis and clearance. In vivo studies indicated that nanomicelles CI@SPK improved the learning and cognitive impairments of APP/PS1 mice by reducing Aβ plaque and inflammation, signifying the potential value of CI@SPK in clinical application for AD treatment.",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces
40145988,Impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation by soluble amyloid-β oligomers is mediated by glutamate transporter 1 expressed in neurons.,"In Alzheimer's disease, perturbations of glutamate neurotransmission lead to synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. Several studies have used glutamate transport inhibitors to demonstrate that soluble oligomers of amyloid-β induce synaptic dysfunction by interrupting glutamate uptake mediated by glutamate transporter 1, the major glutamate transporter in the brain. The cellular targets of the synaptic effects of soluble amyloid-β oligomers, including the nature of any interaction with glutamate transporter 1, remain ill-defined. We have generated a conditional glutamate transporter 1 knockout mouse to investigate celltype specific functions of glutamate transporter 1. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were examined in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. We confirmed that hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment is induced by both soluble Aβ oligomers and glutamate uptake inhibitors. Amyloid-β oligomers, including those isolated directly from the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, failed to inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation in neuronal glutamate transporter 1 but not astrocytic glutamate transporter 1 knockout mice. The masking or occlusion of the effect of soluble Aβ oligomers by knockout of glutamate transporter 1 in neurons suggests that the metabolic or signaling consequences of knockout of glutamate transporter 1 in neurons and oAβ inhibition of synaptic plasticity show epistasis and thus share a similar molecular pathway. To extend these observations, we tested the effects of other types of manipulation of glutamate homeostasis on synaptic plasticity and the pathophysiology of soluble Aβ oligomers. Ceftriaxone, which upregulates glutamate transporter 1 levels, among other effects, prevented the impairment of long-term potentiation by soluble Aβ oligomers. Collectively, our findings suggest that the effects of amyloid-β on synaptic function are highly dependent on glutamate reuptake homeostasis and that the disruption of synaptic function by soluble Aβ oligomers is mediated by pathways linked to neuronal, not astrocytic, glutamate transporter 1. This study's findings highlight the translational potential of targeting neuronal glutamate transporter 1 to counteract amyloid-β-induced synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. By showing that glutamate transporter 1 upregulation (e.g., via ceftriaxone) can prevent Aβ-related impairments, this research supports developing therapies aimed at modulating glutamate homeostasis to preserve synaptic function and combat cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",Neural Regen Res
40130579,Activation of Cytosolic Cathepsin B Activity in the Brain by Traumatic Brain Injury and Inhibition by the Neutral pH Selective Inhibitor Probe Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK.,"Cathepsin B has been shown to contribute to deficits in traumatic brain injury (TBI), an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cathepsin B is elevated in TBI and AD patients, as well as in animal models of these conditions. Knockout of the cathepsin B gene results in amelioration of TBI-induced motor dysfunction and improvement of AD memory deficit in mice. The mechanism of cathepsin B pathogenesis in these brain disorders has been hypothesized to involve its translocation to the cytosol from its normal lysosomal location. This study, therefore, evaluated brain cytosolic cathepsin B activity in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model of TBI. CCI-TBI resulted in motor deficits demonstrated by the rotarod assay, brain tissue lesions, and disorganization of the hippocampus. Significantly, CCI-TBI increased cytosolic cathepsin B activity in the brain cortex in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere that received the CCI-TBI injury, with a concomitant decrease in the lysosomal fraction. Cathepsin B activity was monitored using the substrate Z-Nle-Lys-Arg-AMC which specifically detects cathepsin B activity but not other cysteine proteases. The normal lysosomal distribution of cathepsin B was observed by its discrete localization in brain cortical cells. CCI-TBI resulted in a more diffuse cellular distribution of cathepsin B consistent with translocation to the cytosol. Further studies utilized the novel neutral pH-selective inhibitor, Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK, that specifically inhibits cathepsin B at neutral pH 7.2 of the cytosol but not at acidic pH 4.6 of lysosomes. Daily administration of Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK (ip), beginning 1 day before CCI-TBI, resulted in the reduction of the increased cytosolic cathepsin B activity induced by CCI-TBI. The inhibitor also reduced cathepsin B activities in homogenates of the brain cortex and hippocampus which were increased by CCI-TBI. Furthermore, the Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK inhibitor resulted in the reduction of motor function deficit resulting from CCI-TBI. These findings demonstrate the activation of cytosolic cathepsin B activity in CCI-TBI mouse brain injury.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40090653,Going beyond ATP binding site as a novel inhibitor design strategy for tau protein kinases in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the top mortality causing diseases worldwide. The presence of extracellular β-amyloidosis, as well as intraneuronal neurofibrillary aggregates of the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein are two major characteristics of AD. Targeting protein kinases that are involved in the disease pathways has been a common approach in the fight against AD. Unfortunately, most kinase inhibitors currently available target the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- binding site, which has proven unsuccessful due to issues with selectivity and resistance. As a result, a pressing need to find other alternative sites beyond the ATP- binding site has profoundly evolved. In this review, we will showcase some case studies of inhibitors of tau protein kinases acting beyond ATP binding site which have shown promising results in alleviating AD.",Int J Biol Macromol
40042672,"Overlapping presence of β-amyloid, tau, p-tau, and α-synuclein in skin nerve fibers in Alzheimer's disease.","OBJECTIVE: Skin nerve fiber deposition of proteins can be strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-SN) in synucleinopathies. Little is known about other neurodegenerative proteins, such as tau or β-amyloid, in skin nerve fibers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their link to underlying neurodegeneration. We therefore aimed for describing the presence and distribution of these proteins in the skin of patients with AD and non-AD controls.
METHODS: Skin biopsies were taken from 45 patients with AD (n = 23) and non-AD controls (n = 22). Nerve fibers were identified using antibodies against protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), and protein deposits were evaluated with double-immunostaining of β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42), p-SN, tau, and phospho-tau (p-tau).
RESULTS: Skin nerve fiber Aβ1-42 was present in 7/23 (30.4%) patients with AD and 7/22 (31.8%) controls. p-tau was detected in 12/23 (52.2%) patients with AD and 9/22 (40.9%) controls. Tau was present in 19/23 (82.6%) patients with AD and 16/22 (72.7%) controls. p-SN was detected in 12/23 (52.2%) patients with AD and 8/22 (36.4%) controls. Frequencies of deposits were not significantly different between groups and protein frequency did not correlate with severity of cognitive impairment.
INTERPRETATION: Deposits of β-amyloid 1-42, p-SN, tau, and p-tau were detected in skin nerve fibers in both patient groups; however, qualitative assessment did not discriminate between AD and non-AD patients at this sample size. Future analyses of protein distribution and spreading in peripheral nerves may give new insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, but may require quantitative detection.",J Neurol
40038746,EnSCAN: ENsemble Scoring for prioritizing CAusative variaNts across multiplatform GWASs for late-onset alzheimer's disease.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disorder of the aging population. LOAD is characterized by cognitive decline, such as deterioration of memory, loss of intellectual abilities, and other cognitive domains resulting from due to traumatic brain injuries. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) presents a complex genetic etiology that is still unclear, which limits its early or differential diagnosis. The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) enable the exploration of individual variants' statistical interactions at candidate loci, but univariate analysis overlooks interactions between variants. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can capture hidden, novel, and significant patterns while considering nonlinear interactions between variants to understand the genetic predisposition for complex genetic disorders. When working on different platforms, majority voting cannot be applied because the attributes differ. Hence, a new post-ML ensemble approach was developed to select significant SNVs via multiple genotyping platforms. We proposed the EnSCAN framework using a new algorithm to ensemble selected variants even from different platforms to prioritize candidate causative loci, which consequently helps improve ML results by combining the prior information captured from each dataset. The proposed ensemble algorithm utilizes the chromosomal locations of SNVs by mapping to cytogenetic bands, along with the proximities between pairs and multimodel Random Forest (RF) validations to prioritize SNVs and candidate causative genes for LOAD. The scoring method is scalable and can be applied to any multiplatform genotyping study. We present how the proposed EnSCAN scoring algorithm prioritizes candidate causative variants related to LOAD among three GWAS datasets.",BioData Min
40095520,Changes in transcriptional regulation in the temporal lobe in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with intricate pathophysiological mechanisms. Transcriptome analysis has been used to investigate the pathogenesis of AD from the perspectives of mRNA expression, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation. However, these 3 transcriptomic regulatory layers have not been comprehensively explored, limiting our understanding of the transcriptomic landscapes of AD pathogenesis.ObjectiveWe aimed to describe the transcriptomic landscapes of AD pathogenesis, detect the contributions of different regulatory layers to the total transcriptional variance, and identify diagnostic candidates for AD prediction.MethodsWe collected RNA sequencing data derived from the temporal lobes of 257 patients with AD and 97 controls, performed joint transcriptional analysis with multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA2) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and evaluated the signals with regression models.ResultsWe found that increasing Braak stage is associated with progressive downregulation of SYT1, CHN1, SNAP25, VSNL1, and ENC1 as well as upregulation of TNS1, SGK1, CPM, PPFIBP, and CLMN. Subsequent MOFA2 revealed that alternative splicing contributes most (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.558) to the transcriptional variance between patients with AD and controls followed by alternative polyadenylation (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.449) and mRNA expression (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.438). In addition, the regression model constructed with SNAP25, VSNL1, and ENC1 expression could distinguish between patients with AD and controls (AUC = 0.752).ConclusionsWe systematically detailed the transcriptional landscapes in patients with AD and report mRNA signals associated with AD, offering novel insights into AD pathogenesis and therapeutic development.",J Alzheimers Dis
40017567,"Graph Theoretical Measures for Alzheimer's, MCI, and Normal Controls: A Comparative Study Using MRI Data.","BACKGROUND: The Graph theory provides the platform that could be used to model complex brain networks mathematically, and it could play a significant role in the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
PURPOSE: The main aim of our study is to perform a comparative analysis in terms of various graph theoretic measures of structural brain networks. In particular, the paper evaluates graph theoretical measures by first forming graphs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
METHOD: In this paper, we study and evaluate graph theoretical measures using MRI data, namely characteristic path length, global efficiency, strength, and clustering coefficient, in a cohort of normal controls (N = 30), a cohort of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (N = 30), and a cohort of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (N = 30). In our work, MRI data is preprocessed and cortical thickness is extracted for each brain region. The connectivity matrix is obtained, and thus a graph is formed. We have also performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC analyses of all graph theoretical measures to better elucidate and validate the results.
RESULTS: It is observed that these measures may be used to differentiate Alzheimer's from normal. In our study, we observed that a very random and disrupted network is obtained in the case of Alzheimer's in comparison with the normal and MCI cases. The other observations in terms of graph theoretic measures are an increase in characteristic path length, a decrease in global efficiency, a decrease in strength, and a reduction in values of the clustering coefficient in the case of Alzheimer's.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that graph theoretical measures and alterations in network topology could be used as quantitative biomarkers of AD.",Ann Neurosci

METHODS: We investigated cross-sectionally adults aged &gt; 50 without dementia included in the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) study. PPO was tested as a predictor of quantitative levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (1-42) (Aβ1-42) in those with a parental history of dementia (n = 688) and of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and EPAD neuropsychological examination (ENE) subscores in an amyloid positive subgroup (n = 226). Possible interactions were explored.
RESULTS: Shorter PPO predicted lower CSF Aβ1-42 level (β = 9.357; T = 4.161; p &lt; 0.001), interacting with apolipoprotein E (APOE) -𝜀4 carriage in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitant APOE-𝜀2 carriage appeared to provide protection. PPO did not predict p-tau levels or cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: PPO may provide a valid method of stratifying risk of early AD pathologic change in APOE-𝜀4 carriers, with empirical and clinical applications.
HIGHLIGHTS: Proximity to age of parental dementia onset can predict amyloid accrualThe effect is APOE-𝜀4 dose-dependent and APOE-𝜀2 appears to provide protectionPPO does not appear to predict further advancement along the AD continuumIn the era of anti-amyloid treatments, this may inform timing of amyloid screeningUsed as an empirical metric, PPO could help elucidate the natural history of LOAD.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
39976249,"Identification of a novel pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine compound as a potent glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor for treating Alzheimer's disease.","Herein, a novel pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-based glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor, S01, was rationally designed and synthesised to target Alzheimer's disease (AD). S01 inhibited GSK-3β, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.35 ± 0.06 nM, and had an acceptable kinase selectivity for 24 structurally similar kinases. Western blotting assays indicated that S01 efficiently increased the expression of p-GSK-3β-Ser9 and decreased p-tau-Ser396 levels in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro cell experiments, S01 showed low cytotoxicity to SH-SY5Y cells, significantly upregulated the expression of β-catenin and neurogenesis-related biomarkers, and effectively promoted the outgrowth of differentiated neuronal neurites. Moreover, S01 substantially ameliorated dyskinesia in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced zebrafish AD models at a concentration of 0.12 μM, which was more potent than Donepezil (8 μM) under identical conditions. Acute toxicity experiments further confirmed the safety of S01 in vivo. Our findings suggested that S01 is a prospective GSK-3β inhibitor and can be tested as a candidate for treating AD.",J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem
40039558,Novel Alzheimer's Disease Stating Based on Comorbidities-Informed Graph Neural Networks.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, requires early prediction for timely intervention. Leveraging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), our study employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-class AD classification. Initial steps involve creating a patient-clinical graph network considering latent relationships among cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients, followed by training several GNN-based techniques for building prediction models. Incorporating comorbidity data from electronic health records into the feature set yielded the most effective classification results. Notably, the GNN model with attention mechanisms outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in multi-class AD classification, achieving an accuracy = 0.92 [0.91,0.94], AUC = 0.96 [0.95,0.96], and F1-score = 0.92 [0.91,0.94]. This work highlights comorbidity data's impact on AD classification and suggests its potential to deepen disease understanding.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40059173,Identification of Alzheimer's disease brain networks based on EEG phase synchronization.,"OBJECTIVE: Using the phase synchronization of EEG signals, two different phases, PLI and PLV, were used to construct brain network analysis and graph convolutional neural network, respectively, to achieve automatic identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: In this paper, we selected outpatients (16 AD subjects, 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 21 healthy control (HC) subjects) from the outpatient clinic of Yangpu Mental Health Center in Shanghai, China, from January 2023 to December 2023, and collected resting-state EEG data. To collect resting-state EEG data, each patient was asked to sit down with eyes closed for 5 min. Firstly, the acquired EEG data were preprocessed to extract the data in the α-band at 8-13 Hz; secondly, the phase lag index (PLI) and phase-locked value (PLV) were used to construct the brain functional network, and the brain functional connectivity map was visualized by brain functional connectivity analysis. Finally, the constructed PLI and PLV were input into the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model as node features for training and classification, respectively.
RESULTS: Healthy controls had relatively strong mean brain functional connectivity in the PLV brain network compared to AD and MCI patients. MCI patients showed lower mean brain functional connectivity in the brain network of PLI, while all three groups showed significant differences in brain functional connectivity between parietal and occipital lobes. The GCN model improved classification accuracy by more than 10% compared to using a machine learning classifier. When PLV was used as the nodal feature in the GCN model, the model achieved an average classification accuracy of 77.80% for the three groups of AD, MCI and HC, which was an improvement over the accuracy of choosing raw EEG data and PLI as the nodal feature. The performance of the model was further validated.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results show that the GCN model can effectively identify the graph structure compared with the traditional machine learning model, the GCN-PLV model can better classify AD patients, and the alpha band is proved to be more suitable for AD resting-state EEG by tenfold cross-validation. The brain network map constructed based on PLI and PLV can further capture the local features of EEG signals and the intrinsic functional relationships between brain regions, and the combination of these two models has certain reference value for the diagnosis of AD patients.",Biomed Eng Online
40035614,Network pharmacology exploring the mechanistic role of indirubin phytoconstituent from Indigo naturalis targeting GSK-3β in Alzheimer's disease.,"One of the most common causes of dementia in older adults is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous mechanisms, including acetylcholine breakdown, amyloid beta buildup, neurofibrillary tangle accumulation, and inflammation, are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Different targets have been demonstrated in studies to alleviate the cognitive impairment in AD. In AD, amyloid β impairs phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3)/Akt signaling, activating GSK-3β. This sequence leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of tau, the creation of neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal death, loss of synapses, and memory impairments, all of which are typical symptoms seen in the brains of individuals with AD. Using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and MD simulations, we have determined that indirubin can selectively interact with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β). Traditional Chinese Medicine, including Indigo naturalis, is known to have the ability to control chronic diseases having indirubin as the main phytoconstituent. The binding energy of indirubin was -10.9 kcal/mol, which was better than that of the reference ligand with -9.4 kcal/mol. According to MD simulations, the indirubin-GSK-3β complex remained stable during the simulation, exhibiting an RMSD of 1.90 in comparison to the 2.01 and 2.34 for reference-GSK-3β complex and free protein, respectively. According to our study, indirubin phytoconstituent from Indigo naturalis, targets GSK-3β in AD, additional investigation in the quest for inhibitors of this crucial biological target required further in-vitro/in-vivo experimental validations.",J Biomol Struct Dyn
40149898,Formation of a Neuronal Membrane Model: A Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring Study.,"Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) that model neuronal membranes are needed to explore the role of membrane lipids in the misfolding and aggregation of amyloid proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The neuronal membranes include not only phospholipids, but also significant amounts of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and gangliosides, which are critical to its biological function. In this study, we explored the conditions for the formation of an SLB, for the five-component lipid mixture composed of zwitterionic 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), anionic 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS), nonionic cholesterol (Chol), zwitterionic sphingomyelin (SM), and anionic ganglioside (GM), using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technique, by varying experimental parameters such as pH, buffer type, temperature, vesicle size, and osmotic stress. SLB formation from this multicomponent lipid system was found challenging because the vesicles adsorbed intact on the quartz crystal and failed to rupture. For most of the variables tested, other than osmotic stress, we found no or only partial vesicle rupture leading to either a supported layer of vesicles or a partial SLB that included unruptured vesicles. When osmotic stress was applied to the vesicles already adsorbed on the surface, by having a different salt concentration in the rinse buffer that follows vesicle flow compared to that of the dilution buffer during vesicle flow and adsorption, vesicle rupture increased, but it remained incomplete. In contrast, when osmotic stress was applied during vesicle flow and adsorption on the surface, by having different salt concentrations in the dilution buffer in which vesicles flowed compared to the hydration buffer in which vesicles were prepared, complete vesicle rupture and successful formation of a rigid SLB was demonstrated. The robustness of this approach to form SLBs by applying osmotic stress during vesicle adsorption was found to be independent of the number of lipid components, as shown by SLB formation from the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-component lipid systems.",Biomolecules

Objective: To review the evidence on phonological and articulatory speech processing in older adults with MCI and AD and identify the most sensitive speech assessment tasks for detecting impairments in these abilities. Methods: This scoping review of the PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ProQuest, and Embase databases was updated in April 2024. Studies of older adults with MCI and AD that evaluated articulatory or phonological aspects of speech were included in the review. Two independent reviewers used EndNote and Rayyan software to evaluate search results in a two-phase process, consisting of (1) title and abstract screening, and (2) full-text review. Results: Of the 163 studies retrieved, 41 were selected in Phase 1. At the end of Phase 2, 29 studies were included in the review. All studies included individuals with AD and only one also included participants with MCI. Normal phonological and articulatory performance was observed in MCI. In AD, phonological or articulatory alterations were associated with the speech assessment method, sample size, and diagnosis of atypical dementia. Conclusions: Phonological and articulatory changes may occur in AD but may be difficult to identify. Single repetition or naming tasks may be more sensitive for detecting these impairments.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40112319,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the characteristics of transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment protocols for patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition causing dementia. Currently, there has been no established non-pharmacological treatment for cognitive decline in patients with AD. Recent evidence suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be effective as a non-invasive treatment for improving cognitive function in AD.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the characteristics of rTMS treatment protocols for patients with ADMethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search on clinical trials on rTMS for improving cognitive decline in patients with AD, using the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases and performed a meta-analysis according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. To clarify which cognitive domains in AD are improved by rTMS, meta-analyses were conducted on both global cognitive function and on each cognitive domain including verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function. In addition, sub-analyses of the treatment details of rTMS parameters including stimulation sites, stimulation frequency, stimulation intensity, and with/without the neuro-navigation technique and meta-regression analyses adjusting for gender, education, and the number of rTMS pulses were performed.ResultsThe results showed significant improvements in global cognitive function, while no significant findings in verbal memory, processing speed and executive function. No significant results were found in subgroup analysis or meta-regression.ConclusionsTo enrich the evidence for cognitive enhancement in AD with rTMS, the randomized controlled trials using a unified rTMS protocol with a larger sample size are warranted.",J Alzheimers Dis
39984290,Modified Decision Tree with Custom Splitting Logic Improves Generalization across Multiple Brains' Proteomic Data Sets of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Many factors negatively affect a generalization of the findings in discovery proteomics. They include differentiation between patient cohorts, a variety of experimental conditions, etc. We presented a machine-learning-based workflow for proteomics data analysis, aiming at improving generalizability across multiple data sets. In particular, we customized the decision tree model by introducing a new parameter, min_groups_leaf, which regulates the presence of the samples from each data set inside the model's leaves. Further, we analyzed a trend for the feature importance's curve as a function of the novel parameter for feature selection to a list of proteins with significantly improved generalization. The developed workflow was tested using five proteomic data sets obtained for post-mortem human brain samples of Alzheimer's disease. The data sets consisted of 535 LC-MS/MS acquisition files. The results were obtained for two different pipelines of data processing: (1) MS1-only processing based on DirectMS1 search engine and (2) a standard MS/MS-based one. Using the developed workflow, we found seven proteins with expression patterns that were unique for asymptomatic Alzheimer patients. Two of them, Serotransferrin TRFE and DNA repair nuclease APEX1, may be potentially important for explaining the lack of dementia in patients with the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.",J Proteome Res
40109277,The role of DPP6 dysregulation in neuropathology: from synaptic regulation to disease mechanisms.,"As a transmembrane protein, DPP6 modulates the function and properties of ion channels, playing a crucial role in various tissues, particularly in the brain. DPP6 interacts with potassium channel Kv4.2 (KCND2), enhancing its membrane expression and channel kinetics. Potassium ion channels are critical in progressing action potential formation and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, dysfunction of DPP6 can lead to significant health consequences. Abnormal DPP6 expression has been identified in several diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Recent research has indicated a connection between DPP6 and Alzheimer's disease as well. The most common symptoms resulting from DPP6 dysregulation are mental deficiency and muscle wastage. Notably, these symptoms do not always occur at the same time. Besides genetic factors, environmental factors also undoubtedly play a role in diseases related to DPP6 dysregulation. However, it remains unclear how the expression of DPP6 gets regulated. This review aims to summarize the associations between DPP6 and neurological diseases, offering insights as well as proposing hypotheses to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of DPP6 dysregulation.",Front Cell Neurosci
40000535,Insights Into the Therapeutic Potential of SIRT1-modifying Compounds for Alzheimer's Disease: A Focus on Molecular Mechanisms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Recent studies have highlighted the roles of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD + -dependent deacetylase, in regulating various biological pathways associated with AD pathology, including amyloid-beta metabolism, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of synthetic and natural compounds that modulate SIRT1 levels, emphasizing their molecular mechanisms of action. We explore a range of SIRT1-modifying agents, including polyphenols such as resveratrol, as well as synthetic analogs and novel pharmaceuticals that aim to enhance SIRT1 activity. Additionally, we discuss emerging innovative therapies, including pharmacological agents that improve SIRT1 signaling through mechanisms like photobiomodulation and nutritional interventions. These compounds not only target SIRT1 but also integrate into broader metabolic and neuroprotective pathways, presenting a promising approach to ameliorating AD symptoms. By elucidating the intricate interactions between SIRT1-modifying compounds and their effects on AD pathology, this review aims to advance the understanding of potential therapeutic strategies that could delay or prevent the progression of AD.",J Mol Neurosci
40101933,Concordance between Centiloid quantification and visual interpretation of amyloid PET scans across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate identification of cerebral beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation is crucial for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and determining eligibility for anti-Aβ therapies. The Centiloid (CL) scale has emerged as a standardized method to harmonize Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) quantification across different tracers and sites. We aimed to evaluate the concordance between CL quantification and visual interpretation in a cohort of cognitively impaired (CI) and unimpaired (CU) participants who underwent Aβ PET.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one participants (mean age 69 ± 12.3 years) were prospectively enrolled in AD studies and underwent 247 Aβ PET scans, including 157 with [<sup>11</sup>C]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and 90 with [<sup>18</sup>F]Florbetaben (FBB). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were converted to the CL scale following Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) guidelines. Percent agreement and kappa statistics were used to evaluate the concordance between CL thresholds and visual interpretation in determining Aβ positivity.
RESULTS: The highest concordance rate for the whole cohort was 93% using a CL cutoff of 18 (kappa coefficient 0.84). Using FBB, the concordance rate was highest using a CL cutoff of 24 (97%), whereas the concordance rate for PiB peaked at 94% at a CL cutoff of 18. Concordance was higher in negative than positive Aβ PET cases, 98% versus 90%. Concordance was slightly higher in CI participants, compared to CU (96% versus 93%). Disagreement commonly occurred when focal areas of Aβ positivity were identified on visual interpretation but did not meet the threshold globally by CL quantification.
CONCLUSIONS: Global CL quantification of Aβ PET scans is highly concordant with visual interpretation. Combining both methods may provide a more complete assessment of the extent of Aβ deposition in the brain.

40112890,Skilled Nursing Facility Utilization Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between skilled nursing facility (SNF) utilization and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: An observational cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included community-dwelling respondents aged 65 or older.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from 3 waves of the Health and Retirement Study and employed multivariable, individual-level regressions. The primary outcomes were any SNF stays, the number of SNF stays, and the total number of SNF days, in the past 2 years of the survey. Respondents were classified as cognitively normal, having cognitive impairment but not dementia (CIND), or having ADRD.
RESULTS: The study included 23,654 respondent-years, representing 12,529 unique respondents. Before the pandemic, differences in any SNF stays, and the number of SNF stays between the cognitively normal and CIND and ADRD groups were statistically insignificant in multivariable regressions. During the pandemic, compared with respondents with normal cognition, those with CIND had higher odds of any SNF stays (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06-2.20) and more SNF stays (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.40; 95% CI, 1.30-4.40); similarly, the ADRD group showed higher odds of any SNF stays (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.08-2.59) and more SNF stays (IRR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.36-4.47) than cognitively normal older adults. The total number of SNF days for CIND and ADRD respondents remained statistically insignificantly different from those of the cognitively normal group, both before and during the pandemic, in regression analyses.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This cohort study suggests that the pandemic was associated with increased differences in any SNF stays and number of transitions to SNFs between cognitively normal individuals and those with CIND or ADRD. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the potential impact of a public health emergency on post-acute care utilization among older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment.",J Am Med Dir Assoc
40122396,Fluid-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are increasingly prevalent as global populations age. Fluid biomarkers, derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, saliva, urine, and exosomes, offer a promising solution for early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. These biomarkers can reflect critical pathological processes like amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, α-syn misfolding, TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, and neuronal damage, enabling detection long before clinical symptoms emerge. Recent advances in blood-based biomarkers, particularly plasma Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43, have shown diagnostic accuracy equivalent to CSF biomarkers, offering more accessible testing options. This review discusses the current challenges in fluid biomarker research, including variability, standardization, and sensitivity issues, and explores how combining multiple biomarkers with clinical symptoms improves diagnostic reliability. Ethical considerations, future directions involving extracellular vehicles (EVs), and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are also highlighted. Continued research efforts will be key to overcoming these obstacles, enabling fluid biomarkers to become crucial tools in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative diseases.",Ageing Res Rev

However, their relationship with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD-plus), a potential biomarker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains uncertain.ObjectiveTo explore the association between NSI, HDS and SCD-plus among older adults.MethodsThis cross-sectional study utilized data from the Hubei Memory and Aging Cohort Study (HMACS, 2018-2022), examining the relationship between HDS, NSI, and SCD-plus status and feature scores, using logistic and linear regression models.ResultsAmong 3514 adults (age: ≥ 65 y; female: 52.44%), 1329 had SCD-plus status (37.82%). After adjusting for covariates, living with spouse only was associated with lower odds of SCD-plus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.55, 0.95]) compared to living alone. Frequent NSI was linked to lower odds of SCD-plus (OR = 0.65, 95% CI [0.54, 0.80]) and reduced feature scores (regression coefficient [β] = -0.16, 95% CI [-0.25, -0.07]). Compared to living alone - no NSI, all other combinations showed better SCD-plus status, especially living with spouse only with frequent NSI, which demonstrated a 55% reduction in likelihood (OR = 0.45, 95% CI [0.28, 0.73]).ConclusionsLiving with spouse only and frequent NSI significantly lowers the odds of SCD-plus, providing a basis for further exploration of the impact of social interactions on cognitive health.",J Alzheimers Dis
39995290,Fluorescent Fingerprint Identification of Protein Structural Changes and Disease-Specific Amyloid Beta Aggregates Based on a Single-Nanozyme Sensor Array.,"The misfolding of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides into an aggregation state is a central hallmark of the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, conventional methods are mainly focused on detecting a specific Aβ peptide, which makes it difficult to recognize multiple analytes with different topological features and unfolded states at the same time. Here, we propose a simple and universal sensing strategy to construct a fluorescence sensor array by using a single-nanozyme probe combined with three fluorescent substrates as three recognition units to probe the protein structural changes and identify between multiple Aβ assemblies. In this sensor system, the fingerprint-like patterns are produced from the nonspecific interactions between topological proteins and the sensing units. As a result, this sensor array can accurately identify 13 kinds of proteins and their mixtures at different ratios. Moreover, the sensor array can discriminate against proteins with unfolded states and diverse conformational forms. Most importantly, the sensor array successfully distinguishes between multiple Aβ species, even in artificial cerebrospinal fluid samples and human serum samples. This work provides an attractive and reliable strategy for predicting pathologically relevant proteins and clinical diagnosis of AD.",Anal Chem

Bidimensional relationship exists between periodontal disease and AD, where periodontal disease could exacerbate the severity of AD and cognitive decline reduces the oral hygiene maintenance, increasing the severity of periodontal disease. Dentists should recognize the relationship between periodontal disease and Alzheimer's for better patient management.
AIMS: The study aims to assess the knowledge, awareness, and practices about periodontal disease as a potential risk factor for Alzheimer's disease among dentists.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This cross-sectional survey consisting of 20 structured, close-ended questionnaire was circulated among dentists practicing in Western Maharashtra, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Google form consisting of pre-validated, structured 20 questionnaire was the means to acquire data from dentists willing to participate in the study. The link to google form questionnaire was mailed to the dentists.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Chi-square tests were used to determine the association of predictors/risk factors (periodontal disease) with AD. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software.
RESULTS: 185 dentists participated in the study. The study's results revealed a significant lack of knowledge and awareness ( P < 0.001) among dentists about the correlation between periodontal disease and AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Dentist's overall knowledge, awareness, and practices were lacking regarding the association between periodontal disease and AD. Dentists should be educated about the bidirectional relationship between AD and periodontal disease, through continuing dental education programs.

40140365,Shared early molecular mechanisms revealed in P301S and 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early molecular events that influence disease progression. Still, the molecular mechanisms caused by different mutations of AD are not understood. We have performed a multidisciplinary study to investigate and compare the early stages of the pathology in two transgenic AD mouse models: P301S and 5xFAD. Using SNOTRAP-based mass spectrometry, we assessed changes in S-nitrosylation, a nitric oxide-mediated post-translational modification, of proteins in both models during their juvenile age. The increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine confirmed nitrosative stress in the mutant mice. Systems biology analysis revealed shared processes between the models, particularly in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission processes. In the P301S model, we identified 273 S-nitrosylated (SNOed) proteins in the cortex, with 244 proteins uniquely SNOed in the diseased mice. In the 5xFAD model, 309 SNOed proteins were identified. We have found altered proteins expression of different glutamate/GABA-related markers in the cortex and hippocampus of both AD mouse models. Additionally, the phosphorylation levels of the mTOR signaling components revealed hyperactivation of this pathway in P301S mice. Conversely, 5xFAD mice showed no significant changes in mTOR signaling except for elevated phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 in the cortex. Our findings revealed key molecular mechanisms in the two AD mouse models during their early stages. These mechanisms could serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early-stage AD.",Transl Psychiatry
40028337,Pathogenesis and therapeutic applications of microglia receptors in Alzheimer's disease.,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, continuously monitor the brain's microenvironment through their array of specific receptors. Once brain function is altered, microglia are recruited to specific sites to perform their immune functions, including phagocytosis of misfolded proteins, cellular debris, and apoptotic cells to maintain homeostasis. When toxic substances are overproduced, microglia are over-activated to produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induce chronic inflammatory responses and lead to neurotoxicity. Additionally, microglia can also monitor and protect neuronal function through microglia-neuron crosstalk. Microglia receptors are important mediators for microglia to receive external stimuli, regulate the functional state of microglia, and transmit signals between cells. In this paper, we first review the role of microglia-expressed receptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease; moreover, we emphasize the complexity of targeting microglia for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative disorders to inform the discovery of new biomarkers and the development of innovative therapeutics.",Front Immunol
40084028,"Domain-specific longitudinal associations between brain volume, white matter lesions, and cognitive function changes.","OBJECTIVES: We investigated the domain-specific patterns of the association of segmental brain volume and white matter signal abnormality (WMSA) volume with longitudinal changes in cognitive function.
METHODS: Participants from an institutional health check-up program who were aged >50 years, did not have a confirmed central nervous system disorder and underwent baseline and follow-up evaluations for cognitive function and brain MRI with an interval of at least 1 year were included. Cognitive function was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Korean version (CERAD-K) assessment battery. Performance changes in each cognitive domain were analyzed for associations with serial data of segmental brain volume and WMSA volume.
RESULTS: A total of 190 subjects were included (115 [60.1 %] females, mean age 68.2 ± 8.2 years [range 50-82 years]). Declines in global cognition were associated with lower baseline (P=0.001) and decreasing volumes (P=0.001) of the hippocampus and amygdala and with increasing total WMSA volumes (P=0.008). Declines in the executive function domain were associated with lower baseline volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala (P = 0.018) and with increasing total WMSA volumes (P=0.015). Declines in the language function and the verbal learning domains were associated with lower baseline (P=0.009 and P=0.002, respectively) and decreasing volumes (P=0.008 and P=0.001, respectively) of the hippocampus and amygdala. Decline in the memory recall was associated with higher total WMSA volumes at baseline (P=0.014). Declines in the recognition memory domains were associated with lower baseline hippocampus and amygdala volume (P = 0.020) and with increases in total WMSA volumes (P=0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: The segmental brain volume and the WMSA volume parameters have domain-specific associations with longitudinal cognitive changes, which might reflect the different dependence on the brain reserve according to the cognitive domains.",Heliyon
39988900,Decoding Solubility Signatures from Amyloid Monomer Energy Landscapes.,"This study investigates the energy landscapes of amyloid monomers, which are crucial for understanding protein misfolding mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease. While proteins possess inherent thermodynamic stability, environmental factors can induce deviations from native folding pathways, leading to misfolding and aggregation, phenomena closely linked to solubility. Using the UNOPTIM program, which integrates the UNRES potential into the Cambridge energy landscape framework, we conducted single-ended transition state searches and employed discrete path sampling to compute kinetic transition networks starting from PDB structures. These kinetic transition networks consist of local energy minima and the transition states that connect them, which quantify the energy landscapes of the amyloid monomers. We defined clusters within each landscape using energy thresholds and selected their lowest-energy structures for the structural analysis. Applying graph convolutional networks, we identified solubility trends and correlated them with structural features. Our findings identify specific minima with low solubility, characteristic of aggregation-prone states, highlighting the key residues that drive reduced solubility. Notably, the exposure of the hydrophobic residue Phe19 to the solvent triggers a structural collapse by disrupting the neighboring helix. Additionally, we investigated selected minima to determine the first passage times between states, thereby elucidating the kinetics of these energy landscapes. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of Aβ monomers. By integration of multiple analytical techniques to explore the energy landscapes, our study investigates structural features associated with reduced solubility. These insights have the potential to inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing protein misfolding and aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases.",J Chem Theory Comput
40027342,Donepezil-based rational design of N-substituted quinazolinthioacetamide candidates as potential acetylcholine esterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: in vitro and in vivo studies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the most outstanding progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Obviously, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) is the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine (ACh) with a much more prominent effect than butyrylcholine esterase (BuChE). Hence, novel quinazoline derivatives (3a-p) were designed and synthesized as AChE inhibitors for AD treatment. The newly synthesized quinazoline derivatives (3a-p) were pursued for their inhibitory potential towards both AChE and BuChE. Notably, compound 3e displayed the highest inhibitory potential towards AChE (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.26 nM) surpassing donepezil (IC<sub>50</sub> = 16.43 nM). On the other side, compound 3e effectively negated the decline in memory acquisition and retention instigated by ICV administration of streptozotocin (STZ) in mice, an effect that was comparable to that produced by donepezil. Moreover, compound 3e, reduced BACE1 by 51.08% (p &lt; 0.0001), Aβ42 by 52.47% (p &lt; 0.0001), and p(Ser199)-tau by 69.16% (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to STZ mice. Such effects were similar to those of donepezil which reduced all 3 parameters by 57.53%, 58.5%, and 66.78%, respectively, compared to STZ mice. Furthermore, molecular docking studies showed that the superimposition view clarified the similar binding mode of both 3e and the co-crystallized donepezil at the AChE binding pocket. Moreover, the docked complexes (3e-AChE and 3e-BuChE) were further subject to molecular dynamics simulations for 100 ns. In addition, eligible pharmacokinetic profiles as well as feasible BBB penetration were anticipated for compound 3e using ADME and BBB permeation prediction studies. Accordingly, the synthesized compounds, in particular compound 3e, can be treated as promising lead compounds for AD treatment with future further optimization.",RSC Med Chem
40123689,"Leveraging heterocycle-fused 1,4-benzoquinone to design chemical modulators for both metal-free and metal-bound amyloid-β.","The complex pathology of Alzheimer's disease includes various pathogenic components, such as metal-free amyloid-β (Aβ) and metal-bound Aβ (metal-Aβ). Here we report an effective strategy for developing novel heterocycle-fused 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) compounds to control the aggregation and toxicity of both metal-free Aβ and metal-Aβ. We designed and synthesized these compounds by fusing BQ with 3-pyrazolone responsible for metal chelation. The compounds' ability to form covalent bonds with Aβ is tuned by the annulation of the BQ moiety and the type, position, and number of substituents on the 3-pyrazolone group. Furthermore, the BQ functionality on the 3-pyrazolone framework can undergo o-hydroxylation, enhancing its metal chelation in a bidentate manner. Our results demonstrate that these heterocycle-fused BQ compounds can redirect the assembly of Aβ into less toxic aggregates by binding to metal ions, modifying Aβ structures in both the absence and presence of metal ions, and promoting oxidative changes to Aβ. This study highlights the importance of structural modifications and optimizations of BQ to leverage its strength of covalently cross-linking to Aβ and overcome its limitations in metal chelation and cytotoxicity, which are critical for designing chemical modulators for metal-free Aβ and metal-Aβ. Our approach offers a novel strategy for developing chemical modulators towards metal-related peptides and proteins as well as therapeutic agents for metal-associated amyloid disorders.",Chem Sci
40164861,Alzheimer mimicry: LATE and PART.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia and accounts for 60% of dementia syndromes in people older than 75 years. The correct classification of AD and non-AD cases is mandatory to study disease mechanisms or new treatment possibilities. A typical clinical picture of AD consists of a progressive cognitive decline, with primary memory impairment. Structural, functional, and molecular brain imaging, along with CSF biomarkers of amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and the presence of a vulnerability-associated APOE genotype, support the diagnosis of AD. Use of biomarkers have led to the identification of individuals with mild cognitive impairment who are amyloid-negative addressing a conceptually separate clinical entity named suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (SNAP). Clinical presentation and progression of SNAP can mimic AD which makes the final diagnosis and possible treatment uncertain in up to 30% of cases in clinical centers that are not using biomarkers. These non-AD pathologies are common with advancing age both in cognitively impaired and clinically normal elderly people and include Argyrophilic Grain Disease (ARG), Tangle Predominant Dementia and TDP-43 proteinopathy. The terms Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and Limbic-dominant TDP-43 age-related encephalopathy (LATE) have been proposed as the most common and useful biological and emerging clinical construct to describe this phenomenon in > 80 years old individuals. Current evidence underlines the limitations of existing diagnostic tools, which remain inadequate for fully capturing the complexities of these conditions. Addressing these diagnostic ambiguities is crucial for assigning accurate diagnoses, reducing frequent misdiagnoses of AD, and implementing appropriate therapeutic strategies for elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.",J Neural Transm (Vienna)
40132145,A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer Disease Clinical Trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Among the participants of Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment trials, 40% do not show cognitive decline over 80 weeks of follow-up. Identifying and excluding these individuals can increase power to detect treatment effects. We aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models to identify persons unlikely to show decline on placebo treatment over 80 weeks.
METHODS: We used the data from the placebo arm of EXPEDITION3 AD clinical trial and a subpopulation from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants in the EXPEDITION3 trial were patients with mild dementia and biomarker evidence of amyloid burden. For this study, participants were identified as those who demonstrated clinically meaningful cognitive decline (CMCD) or cognitively stable (CS) at final visit of the trial (week 80). Machine learning-based classifiers were trained to classify participants into CMCD vs CS groups using combinations of demographics, APOE genotype, neuropsychological tests, and biomarkers (volumetric MRI). The results were developed in 70% of the EXPEDITION3 placebo sample using 5-fold cross-validation. Trained models were then used to classify the participants in an internal validation sample and an external matched sample ADNI<sub>AD</sub>.
RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-four of the 1,072 participants in the placebo arm of the EXPEDITION3 trial had necessary follow-up data, who were on average aged 72.7 (±7.7) years and 59% female. 55.8% of those participants showed CMCD (∼2 years younger than those without) at the final visit. In the independent validation sample within the EXPEDITION3 data, all the models showed high sensitivity and modest specificity. Positive predictive values (PPVs) of models were at least 11% higher than base prevalence of CMCD observed at the end of the trial. The subset of matched ADNI participants (ADNI<sub>AD</sub>, N = 105) were aged 74.5 (±6.4) years and 46% female. The models that were validated in ADNI<sub>AD</sub> also showed high sensitivity, modest specificity, and PPVs of at least 15% higher than the base prevalence in ADNI<sub>AD</sub>.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that predictive models have the potential to improve the design of AD trials through selective inclusion and exclusion criteria based on expected cognitive decline. Such predictive models need further validation across data from different AD clinical trials.",Neurology
40058399,Development and Preliminary Validation of Standardized Regression-Based Change Scores as Measures of Transitional Cognitive Decline.,"OBJECTIVE: An increasing focus in Alzheimer's disease and aging research is to identify transitional cognitive decline. One means of indexing change over time in serial cognitive evaluations is to calculate standardized regression-based (SRB) change indices. This paper includes development and preliminary validation of SRB indices for the Uniform Data Set 3.0 Neuropsychological Battery, as well as base rate data to aid in their interpretation.
METHOD: The sample included 1341 cognitively intact older adults with serial assessments over 0.5-2 years in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Database. SRB change scores were calculated in half of the sample, then validated in the other half of the sample. Base rates of SRB decline were evaluated at z-score cut-points, corresponding to two-tailed p-values of .20 (z = -1.282), 0.10 (z = -1.645) and .05 (z = -1.96). We examined convergent associations of SRB indices for each cognitive measure with each other, as well as concurrent associations of SRB indices with Clinical Dementia Rating sum of box scores (CDR-SB).
RESULTS: SRB equations were able to significantly predict the selected cognitive variables. The base rate of at least one significant SRB decline across the entire battery ranged from 28.91% to 64.90%. SRB indices for cognitive measures demonstrated theoretically expected significant positive associations with each other. Additionally, CDR-SB impairment was associated with decline on three different SRB indices.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides preliminary validation of SRB indices in a large sample, and we present a user-friendly tool for calculating SRB values.",Arch Clin Neuropsychol
40078377,The prognosis of mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge gaps remain about the prognosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Conversion rates to dementia vary widely, and reversion to normal cognition has gained attention. This review updates evidence on MCI conversion risk and probability of stability and reversion.
METHODS: We searched databases for studies on MCI prognosis with ≥3 years of follow-up, established criteria for MCI and dementia, and performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to assess conversion risk, reversion, and stability probability. Meta-regressions identified sources of heterogeneity and guided subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: From 89 studies (mean follow-up: 5.2 years), conversion risk was 41.5% (38.3%-44.7%) in clinical and 27.0% (22.0%-32.0%) in population-based studies, with Alzheimer's dementia as the most common outcome. Stability rates were 49.3% (clinical) and 49.8% (population). Reversion was 8.7% (clinical) and 28.2% (population).
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight higher conversion in clinical settings and 30% reversion in population studies, calling for sustainable care pathway development.
HIGHLIGHTS: Prognosis for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) varies by setting; dementia risk is higher and the probability of reversion is lower in clinical-based studies.In both clinical and population settings, cognitive stability is ≈50%.A reorganization of health services could ensure sustainable care for individuals with MCI.Significant heterogeneity in MCI studies impacts data interpretation; follow-up length is crucial.Long-term prognosis studies on MCI in low- and middle-income countries are urgently needed.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
40153923,Exploring the neuromagnetic signatures of cognitive decline from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Developing non-invasive and affordable biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) at a prodromal stage is essential, particularly in the context of new disease-modifying therapies. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical stage preceding dementia, but not all patients with MCI will progress to AD. This study explores the potential of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to predict cognitive decline from MCI to AD dementia.
METHODS: We analysed resting-state MEG data from the BioFIND dataset including 117 patients with MCI among whom 64 developed AD dementia (AD progression), while 53 remained cognitively stable (stable MCI), using spectral analysis. Logistic regression models estimated the additive explanation of selected clinical, MEG, and MRI variables for AD progression risk. We then built a high-dimensional classification model to combine all modalities and variables of interest.
FINDINGS: MEG 16-38Hz spectral power, particularly over parieto-occipital magnetometers, was significantly reduced in the AD progression group. In logistic regression models, decreased MEG 16-38Hz spectral power and reduced hippocampal volume/total grey matter ratio on MRI were independently linked to higher AD progression risk. The data-driven classification model confirmed, among other factors, the complementary information of MEG covariance (AUC = 0.74, SD = 0.13) and MRI cortical volumes (AUC = 0.77, SD = 0.14) to predict AD progression. Combining all inputs led to markedly improved classification scores (AUC = 0.81, SD = 0.12).
INTERPRETATION: These findings highlight the potential of spectral power and covariance as robust non-invasive electrophysiological biomarkers to predict AD progression, complementing other diagnostic measures, including cognitive scores and MRI.

39998322,Identification of 16 novel Alzheimer's disease loci using multi-ancestry meta-analyses.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. While many AD-associated genetic determinants have been identified, few studies have analyzed individuals of non-European ancestry.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy using whole genome sequencing data from the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS), National Institute of Mental Health, UK Biobank (UKB), and All of Us (AoU) consisting of 49,149 cases (12,074 clinically diagnosed and 37,075 AD-by-proxy) and 383,225 controls. Nearly half of NIAGADS and AoU participants were of non-European ancestry.
RESULTS: For clinically diagnosed AD, we identified 14 new loci-five common (FBN2/SCL27A6, AC090115.1, DYM, KCNG1/AL121785.1, TIAM1) and nine rare (VWA5B1, RNU6-755P/LMX1A, MOB1A, MORC1-AS1, LINC00989, PDE4D, RNU2-49P/CDO1, NEO1, and SLC35G3/AC022916.1). Meta-analysis of UKB and AoU AD-by-proxy cases yielded two new rare loci (RPL23/LASP1 and CEBPA/AC008738.6), also nominally significant in NIAGADS.
DISCUSSION: In summary, we provide evidence for 16 novel AD loci and advocate for more studies using whole genome sequencing-based GWAS of diverse cohorts.
HIGHLIGHTS: We used whole-genome sequencing data from large and diverse cohorts. We found novel genome-wide association study findings based on whole-genome data. We performed a multiancestry meta-analysis and incorporated results from underrepresented groups.",Alzheimers Dement
40002775,Identification of Lipophagy-Related Gene Signature for Diagnosis and Risk Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background: Recent research indicates that lipid metabolism and autophagy play crucial roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigating the relationship between AD diagnosis and gene expression related to lipid metabolism, autophagy, and lipophagy may improve early diagnosis and the identification of therapeutic targets. Methods: Transcription datasets from AD patients were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Genes associated with lipid metabolism, autophagy, and lipophagy were sourced from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) database and the Human Autophagy Database (HADb). Lipophagy-related hub genes were identified using a combination of Limma analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning techniques. Based on these hub genes, we developed an AD risk prediction nomogram and validated its diagnostic accuracy using three external validation datasets. Additionally, the expression levels of the hub genes were assessed through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: Our analysis identified three hub genes-ACBD5, GABARAPL1, and HSPA8-as being associated with AD progression. The nomogram constructed from these hub genes achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.894 for AD risk prediction, with all validation sets yielding AUC values greater than 0.8, indicating excellent diagnostic efficacy. qRT-PCR results further corroborated the associations between these hub genes and AD development. Conclusions: This study identified and validated three lipophagy-related hub genes and developed a reliable diagnostic model, offering insights into the pathology of AD and facilitating the diagnosis of AD patients.",Biomedicines
40139011,Competitive electrochemical immunosensor for trace phosphorylated Tau181 analysis in plasma: Toward point-of-care technologies of Alzheimer's disease.,"Accurate detection of core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in biofluids is crucial for identifying preclinical AD and predicting disease progression. Phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), a key biomarker, holds promise for early diagnosis. This work presents a sensitive and rapid electrochemical immunosensor (EC-iSensor) based on screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) for p-tau181 quantification. Employing a competitive immunoassay format, the EC-iSensor utilizes biotinylated p-tau181 as a competitor against the target analyte for binding to immobilized capture antibodies. Signal transduction is achieved via horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The EC-iSensor exhibits a low detection limit of 1.91 fg/mL and a wide dynamic range spanning 6.97 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL in PBS. Furthermore, successful detection of p-tau181 in blood samples from AD patients demonstrated its practical applicability. This cost-effective SPE-based EC-iSensor offers a simple and highly sensitive platform for p-tau181 detection, presenting potential for point-of-care technologies (POCT) of AD.",Talanta
40044873,Optical signature of retinal Tau fibrillation.,"Fibrillated Tau proteins are believed to be a signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be potentially employed as a biosensor for AD early detection. Several studies revealed the presence of Tau accumulation and aggregation in the retina, similar to that observed in the brains of individuals with AD. These retinal changes can be non-invasively visualised through AD-related scores derived from reflectance measurements of the patient fundus. However, a direct link with the optical properties of fibrillated protein clusters is still lacking. Here, we present a new optical technique which measures the scattering optical properties of protein fibrils. Our experimental findings show that the scattering intensity of Tau has a wavelength dependence correlated to their size. The optical signal qualitatively replicates the spectral signature observed in human AD patient retinas. Our paper shows that the Tau protein spectral signature is compatible with the distinctive spectral signature of the AD, further confirming that retinal investigation is a promising tool.",Sci Rep
40033783,Measures of retinal health successfully capture risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at midlife.,"BACKGROUND: Identification of at-risk individuals who would benefit from early intervention for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical as new treatments are developed. Measures of retinal health could offer accessible and low-cost indication of pre-morbid disease risk, but their association with ADRD risk is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether midlife retinal neuronal and microvascular measures are associated with ADRD risk-index scores and individual domains of ADRD risk.
METHODS: Data were from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-representative longitudinal New Zealand-based birth cohort study. 94.1% (N = 938) of living Study members were seen at age 45 (2017-2019). Retinal neuronal (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL)) and microvascular (arterioles and venules) measures were used as predictors. Outcome measures were four top ADRD risk indexes (CAIDE, LIBRA, Lancet, and ADU-ADRI), and a comprehensive midlife ADRD risk index, the DunedinARB.
RESULTS: Poorer retinal microvascular health (narrower arterioles and wider venules) was associated with greater ADRD risk (βs = 0.16-0.31; ps &lt; 0.001). Thinner RNFL was modestly associated with higher ADRD risk (βs = 0.05-0.08; ps = 0.02-0.13). Follow-up tests of distinct domains of ADRD risk indicated that while RNFL associations reflected cardiometabolic risk only, microvascular measures were associated with diverse ADRD risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Measures of retinal health, particularly microvascular measures, successfully capture ADRD risk across several domains of known risk factors, even at the young midlife age of 45 years. Retinal microvascular imaging may be an accessible, scalable, and relatively low-cost method of assessing ADRD risk among middle-aged adults.",J Alzheimers Dis
40010953,Differential Expression of NRF2 in the Cortex and Hippocampus Following Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular dementia is the second most common cognitive disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) is a widely used model of vascular dementia associated with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Previous studies have reported a beneficial role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in BCCAO. This study aimed to investigate NRF2 expression in the cortex and hippocampus at 3 and 14 days after BCCAO.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unoperated male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to the control group, while rats that underwent surgery were assigned to the BCCAO group. The right and left common carotid arteries were exposed beneath the esophagus, separated from the vagus nerve and occluded using 4-0 silk sutures. The cerebral cortex and hippocampus were isolated under anesthesia, 3 and 14 days post-surgery. The expression of NRF2 protein was evaluated using western blot analysis.
RESULTS: NRF2 expression in the cerebral cortex increased 3 and 14 days after BCCAO, compared to control group. In the hippocampus, NRF2 expression of BCCAO group mice was increased at 3 days, but no difference was observed at day 14 compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: Chronic hypoperfusion induced by BCCAO altered the protein expression levels of NRF2 in the cortex and hippocampus, suggesting that NRF2 may have a role in cognitive impairment.",In Vivo
40031510,Automated brain atrophy quantification and evaluation using spatial resolution enhancement.,"Brain atrophy is one of the most common features of neurodegenerative diseases and is particularly critical in the early diagnosis of conditions like Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Automated segmentation and quantification are highly desirable in brain atrophy evaluation but existing methods require high-quality MRI scans with isotropic resolution. However in practice, clinicians usually choose to reduce the number of slices to save time, and because of their anisotropic resolution, the morphometric analysis cannot be implemented. Here we propose the use of an inter-slice interpolation network to increase spatial resolution to isotropic to accomplish morphometric analysis of brain atrophy, which is not feasible to perform with clinical scans. To achieve fully automated quantification, we set up a series of indicators that cover multiple aspects such as holistic and localized, structural and cortical, based on our clinical experience. As a result, a fully automated diagnostic process for pathological brain atrophy is completed. Our results on the IXI and ADNI datasets show that the slice spacing method produces realistic and reliable anatomy and achieves high diagnostic accuracy, and our indicators are well suited to clinical application scenarios.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40151521,Plasma biomarker trajectories: Impact of AD genetic risk and clinical progression.,"INTRODUCTION: We examined long-term plasma biomarker trajectories among participants who were cognitively unimpaired and primarily middle aged at baseline and whether trajectories differed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk and among those who developed cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)<sub>181</sub>, neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells, and chitinase 3-like protein 1 were measured longitudinally in 177 BIOCARD participants (M baseline age = 57.7 years; M follow-up = 15.8 years), including 57 who developed cognitive impairment. Measures of AD genetic risk included apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and an AD polygenic risk score (AD-PRS).
RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, APOE ε4 carriers had lower Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> and greater longitudinal increases in p-tau<sub>181</sub> and GFAP; in contrast, the AD-PRS (excluding the APOE region) was associated with greater declines in Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Rates of increase in p-tau<sub>181</sub>, NfL, and GFAP were greater among those who later developed cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Monitoring changes in plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub>, NfL, and GFAP may be particularly informative during preclinical AD.

40144618,Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease using artificial intelligence and cortical features on T1WI sequences.,"BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging task, which is crucial for helping develop personalized treatment plans to improve prognosis.
PURPOSE: To develop new technology for the early prediction of AD using artificial intelligence and cortical features on MRI.
METHODS: A total of 162 MCI patients were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. By using a 3D-MPRAGE sequence, T1W images for each patient were acquired. All patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 112) and a validation set (n = 50) at a ratio of 7:3. Morphological features of the cerebral cortex were extracted with FreeSurfer software. Network features were extracted from gray matter with the GRETNA toolbox. The network, morphology, network-clinical, morphology-clinical, morphology-network and morphology-network-clinical models were developed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. The performance of each model was assessed by the concordance index (C-index).
RESULTS: In the training group, the C-indexes of the network, morphology, network-clinical, morphology-clinical, morphology-network and morphology-network-clinical models were 0.834, 0.926, 0.915, 0.949, 0.928, and 0.951, respectively. The C-indexes of those models in the validation group were 0.765, 0.784, 0.849, 0.877, 0.884, and 0.880, respectively. The morphology-network-clinical model performed the best. A multi-predictor nomogram with high accuracy for individual AD prediction (C-index = 0.951) was established.
CONCLUSION: The early occurrence of AD could be accurately predicted using our morphology-network-clinical model and the multi-predictor nomogram. This could help doctors make early and personalized treatment decisions in clinical practice, which showed important clinical significance.",Front Neurol
40067442,"Caffeine and sclareol take the edge off the sedative effects of linalool, possibly through the GABAA interaction pathway: molecular insights through in vivo and in silico studies.","Linalool (LIN) has some important neuropharmacological activities, including anxiolytic and sedative effects. It is also clear that it protects experimental animals from convulsions and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, caffeine (CAF) and sclareol (SCL) have neurostimulatory potential. This study evaluates the sedative effect and possible molecular mechanisms of CAF with LIN and/or SCL through in vivo and in silico studies. For this, CAF (10 mg/kg) alone or with LIN (50 mg/kg) and/or SCL (10 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated before thirty minutes of thiopental sodium (TS) injection (40 mg/kg, i.p.) to the mice and observed for latency and duration of sleep up to 4 h. To understand the possible action mechanisms of these drugs, we also performed molecular docking and pharmacokinetics profile studies with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor respective subunits. Findings suggest that LIN exerted significant (p &lt; 0.05) sedative effects on the animals. CAF and SCL alone or in their combinations significantly reduced LIN's effects in mice. CAF, LIN, and SCL showed binding affinities of ‒6.2, ‒5.5, and ‒7.3 kcal/mol with 6X3X of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (α1 and β2 subunits), respectively. Taken together, LIN exerted significant sedative effects, whereas CAF and SCL, either alone or in combination, attenuated this effect in mice. These findings suggest that LIN, CAF, and SCL modulate sedation through interactions with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor pathway. Further clinical studies are required to confirm these results.",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol
40158900,Fingolimod ameliorates amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The immune system plays a critical role in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both T and B lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator fingolimod used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, can promote lymphocyte homing, potentially reducing the infiltration of peripheral lymphocytes into the brain.
METHODS: In this study, 8-month-old APP/PS1 mice were orally administered fingolimod at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or saline as a control for 2 months. After treatment, the mice were subjected to behavioral tests, pathological examinations, and biochemical analyses to evaluate behavioral deficits and AD-type pathologies.
RESULTS: Fingolimod inhibits the infiltration of peripheral lymphocytes into the brain and reduces neuroinflammation. Fingolimod enhances cognitive function and alleviates brain Aβ deposition. Additionally, fingolimod treatment mitigates other AD-related pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Proteomic analysis further confirms the therapeutic effects of fingolimod in AD, reflected by the downregulation of proteins involved in multiple AD-associated pathways.
DISCUSSION: This study illustrates that fingolimod effectively ameliorates multiple pathological features of AD, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for the disease.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40161220,Phyllosphere mycobiome in two Lycopodiaceae plant species: unraveling potential HupA-producing fungi and fungal interactions.,"Huperzine A (HupA), a lycopodium alkaloid with therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, is found exclusively in some species of the Huperzioideae subfamily of Lycopodiaceae. Fungi associated with Huperzioideae species are potential contributors to HupA biosynthesis, offering promising prospects for HupA production. Despite its medical significance, limited knowledge of fungal diversity in lycophytes and the variability of HupA production in fungal strains have impeded the discovery and applications of HupA-producing fungi. Here, we investigated HupA concentrations and the mycobiome across various tissues of two Lycopodiaceae species, Huperzia asiatica (a HupA producer) and Diphasiastrum complanatum (a non-HupA producer). We aim to unveil the distribution of potential HupA-producing fungi in different plant tissues and elucidate fungal interactions within the mycobiome, aiming to uncover the role of HupA-producing fungi and pinpoint their potential fungal facilitators. Among the tissues, H. asiatica exhibited the highest HupA concentration in apical shoots (360.27 μg/g fresh weight) whereas D. complanatum showed no HupA presence in any tissue. We obtained 441 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from H. asiatica and 497 ASVs from D. complanatum. The fungal communities in bulbils and apical shoots of H. asiatica were low in diversity and dominated by Sordariomycetes, a fungal class harboring the majority of reported HupA-producing fungi. Integrating bioinformatics with published experimental reports, we identified 27 potential HupA-producing fungal ASVs, primarily in H. asiatica, with 12 ASVs identified as hubs in the fungal interaction network, underscoring their pivotal roles in mycobiome stability. Members of certain fungal genera, such as Penicillium, Trichoderma, Dioszegia, Exobasidium, Lycoperdon, and Cladosporium, exhibited strong connections with the potential HupA producers in H. asiatica's network rather than in D. complanatum's. This study advances our knowledge of fungal diversity in Lycopodiaceae and provides insights into the search for potential HupA-producing fungi and fungal facilitators.

39999743,Phytomolecules as Alzheimer's therapeutics: A comprehensive review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading neurodegenerative disorder recognized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral changes. The pathology of AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which leads to synaptic loss and subsequent neurodegeneration. Additional contributors to disease progression include metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory factors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is also implicated, as it plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation and the progression of neurodegeneration. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of various phytomolecules and their potential to target multiple aspects of AD pathology. We examined natural products from diverse classes, including stilbenes, flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, coumarins, terpenoids, chromenes, cannabinoids, chalcones, phloroglucinols, and polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs). The key mechanisms of action of these phytomolecules include modulating tau protein dynamics to reduce aggregation, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to maintain neurotransmitter levels and enhance cognitive function, and inhibiting β-secretase (BACE1) to decrease Aβ production. Additionally, some phytomolecules were found to influence GSK-3β activity, thereby impacting tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. By addressing multiple targets, Aβ production, tau hyperphosphorylation, AChE activity, and GSK-3β, these natural products offer a promising multi-targeted approach to AD therapy. This review highlights their potential to develop effective treatments that not only mitigate core pathological features but also manage the complex, multifactorial aspects of AD progression.",Eur J Med Chem
40164234,New insight into the role of altered brain cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD: a unifying cholesterol hypothesis and new therapeutic approach for AD.,"The dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism homeostasis has been universally suggested in the aeotiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Initially, studies indicate that alteration of serum cholesterol level might contribute to AD. However, because blood-brain barrier impedes entry of plasma cholesterol, brain cells are not directly influenced by plasma cholesterol. Furthermore, mounting evidences suggest a link between alteration of brain cholesterol metabolism and AD. Interestingly, Amyloid-β proteins (Aβ) can markedly inhibit cellular cholesterol biosynthesis and lower cellular cholesterol content in cultured cells. And Aβ overproduction/overload induces a significant decrease of brain cellular cholesterol content in familial AD (FAD) animals. Importantly, mutations or polymorphisms of genes related to brain cholesterol transportation, such as ApoE4, ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family and Niemann-Pick C disease 1 or 2 (NPC1/2), obviously lead to decreased brain cholesterol transport, resulting in brain cellular cholesterol loss, which could be tightly associated with AD pathological impairments. Additionally, accumulating data show that there are reduction of brain cholesterol biosynthesis and/or disorder of brain cholesterol trafficking in a variety of sporadic AD (SAD) animals and patients. Collectively, compelling evidences indicate that FAD and SAD could share one common and overlapping neurochemical mechanism: brain neuronal/cellular cholesterol deficiency. Therefore, accumulated evidences strongly support a novel hypothesis that deficiency of brain cholesterol contributes to the onset and progression of AD. This review highlights the pivotal role of brain cholesterol deficiency in the pathogenesis of AD. The hypothesis offers valuable insights for the future development of AD treatment.",Brain Res Bull
40018325,Association between BrainAGE and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"INTRODUCTION: The brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) method uses a machine learning model to generate an age estimate from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal was to study the association of brain age with Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging and plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-three individuals from the Indiana Memory and Aging Study underwent structural MRI, amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma sampling. The MRI scans were processed using the software program BrainAgeR to receive a ""brain age"" estimate. Plasma biomarker concentrations were measured, and partial Pearson correlation models were used to evaluate their relationship with brain age gap (BAG) estimation (BrainAGE = chronological age - MRI estimated brain age).
RESULTS: Significant associations between BAG and amyloid and tau levels on PET and in plasma were observed depending on diagnostic categories.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that BAG is potentially a biomarker of pathology in AD which can be applied to routine brain imaging.
HIGHLIGHTS: Novel research that uses an artificial intelligence learning tool to estimate brain age.Findings suggest that brain age gap is associated with plasma and positron emission tomography Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.Differential relationships are seen in different stages of disease (preclinical vs. clinical).Results could play a role in early AD diagnosis and treatment.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
40015642,A high-throughput assay platform to discover small molecule activators of the phospholipase PLC-γ2 to treat Alzheimer's disease.,"A naturally occurring missense variant of the phospholipase C isozyme, PLC-γ2, harboring a single substitution (P522R) protects against several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The phospholipase activity of PLC-γ2 (P522R) is slightly elevated relative to its WT counterpart, and the general consensus is that this increased activity in microglia confers protection against neurodegeneration. In order to phenocopy this protection, we have developed a high-throughput assay to identify small molecule activators of PLC-γ2. The assay takes advantage of the fluorescent reporter, XY-69, embedded in lipid vesicles to readout the allosteric activation of PLC-γ2. The assay is highly reproducible and capable of identifying compounds with a large range of efficacies. A series of secondary assays have been established to define the selectivity of compounds for PLC-γ2, establish relevant activation of PLC-γ2 by compounds in a microglia cell line, and measure affinities between PLC-γ2 and hit compounds. The established workflow was prototyped using approximately 6000 compounds to produce several promising hits, but more importantly, enables screens of much larger chemical libraries to identify selective activators of PLC-γ2 to be used as chemical probes and drug leads.",J Biol Chem

To determine the significantly distinctive VOCs for AD, a total of 970 participants were enrolled, including 60 individuals in data set 1 (AD, 30; controls, 30), 164 individuals in data set 2 (AD, 82; controls, 82), 637 individuals in data set 3 (AD, 31; controls, 606), and 109 individuals in data set 4 (frontotemporal dementia, 19; vascular dementia, 21; Parkinson's disease, 69). The participants in data sets 1, 2, and 4 were from Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Participants in data set 3 were from a two-year follow-up cohort. VOCs in breath and plasma, neuropsychological scores, plasma p-tau181 levels, metabolites in plasma, and brain functional connectivity were detected. We found that six VOCs were significantly different between the two groups in data set 1 and were verified in data set 2 and data set 3. Ethanol (m/z = 46) and pyrrole (m/z = 67) presented AUC values of 0.907 and 0.895 in data sets 1 and 2 (clinical data sets) and 0.849 and 0.974 in data set 3 (community data set), respectively. The six VOCs were associated with cognitive decline as reflected by neuropsychological tests; five of them were correlated with plasma p-tau181, and these five plasma VOCs were consistently altered as breath VOCs. Correlation between metabolites and five VOCs in plasma was noted, and the five VOCs may originate from blood metabolites. Moreover, four breath VOCs were associated with altered brain connectivity. In conclusion, specific breath VOCs may be used as biomarkers for AD detection.",ACS Sens

40147710,"Flavonoids in the regulation of microglial-mediated neuroinflammation; focus on fisetin, rutin, and quercetin.","Neuroinflammation is a critical mechanism in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorders, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), encephalitis, spinal cord injury (SCI), and cerebral stroke. Neuroinflammation is characterized by increased blood vessel permeability, leukocyte infiltration, glial cell activation, and elevated production of inflammatory mediators, such as chemokines and cytokines. Microglia act as the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, serving as the principal defense mechanism in brain tissue. After CNS injury, microglia modify their morphology and downregulate genes that promote homeostatic functions. Despite comprehensive transcriptome analyses revealing specific gene modifications in ""pathological"" microglia, microglia's precise protective or harmful functions in neurological disorders remain insufficiently comprehended. Accumulating data suggests that the polarization of microglia into the M1 proinflammatory phenotype or the M2 antiinflammatory phenotype may serve as a sensible therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammation. Flavonoids, including rutin, fisetin, and quercetin, function as crucial chemical reservoirs with unique structures and diverse actions and are extensively used to modulate microglial polarization in treating neuroinflammation. This paper highlights the detrimental effects of neuroinflammation seen in neurological disorders such as stroke. Furthermore, we investigate their therapeutic benefits in alleviating neuroinflammation via the modulation of macrophage polarization.",Exp Cell Res
40000385,Traditional Chinese Medicine for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains a challenge for modern medicine due to its complex pathogenesis. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has demonstrated significant success in the prevention and treatment of variable medical conditions. For AD pharmacological management, TCM could provide promising approaches. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the current evidence of the effects of TCM therapies on AD. A systematic search of the literature was performed on electronic databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Web of Science. Thirteen studies were included in this review, subject to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken following the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Our results show that TCM offered a significant improvement in cognitive functioning compared to the control group, measured on both MMSE and ADAS-CoG scales, suggesting its potential utility in slowing cognitive decline and improving cognitive function as compared to conventional drug treatments and placebos. No significant difference was found for scores of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI) or ability to perform daily living activities (ADCS-ADL). These findings highlight TCM as a potential adjuvant therapy, in combination with conventional medicine, to improve the effectiveness and reduce the limitations of conventional AD drug regimes. Studies with larger sample sizes, rigorous study designs, accurate long-term reporting, and correlation to neuropathological markers are needed in the future to enhance the evidence base for the use of TCM in AD patients, and to further confirm its efficacy.",Am J Chin Med
40002697,Non-Invasive Retinal Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain associated with ageing and is the most prevalent form of dementia, affecting an estimated 55 million people worldwide, with projections suggesting this number will exceed 150 million by 2050. With its increasing prevalence, AD represents a significant global health challenge with potentially serious social and economic consequences. Diagnosing AD is particularly challenging as it requires timely recognition. Currently, there is no effective therapy for AD; however, certain medications may help slow its progression. Existing diagnostic methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and biomarker analysis in cerebrospinal fluid tend to be expensive and invasive, making them impractical for widespread use. Consequently, research into non-invasive biomarkers that enable early detection and screening for AD is a crucial area of contemporary clinical investigation. One promising approach for the early diagnosis of AD may be retinal imaging. As an extension of the central nervous system, the retina offers a distinctive opportunity for non-invasive brain structure and function assessment. Considering their shared embryological origins and the vascular and immunological similarities between the eye and brain, alterations in the retina may indicate pathological changes in the brain, including those specifically related to AD. Studies suggest that structural and vascular changes in the retina, particularly within the neuronal network and blood vessels, may act as markers of cerebral changes caused by AD. These retinal alterations have the potential to act as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Since AD is typically diagnosed only after a significant neuronal loss has occurred, identifying early diagnostic markers could enable timely intervention and help prevent disease progression. Non-invasive retinal imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, provide accessible methods for the early detection of changes linked to AD. This review article focuses on the potential of retinal imaging as a non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. Investigating the ageing of the retina and its connections to neurodegenerative processes could significantly enhance the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of AD, paving the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",Biomedicines
40151077,"Synthetic Derivates of Progesterone Ameliorate Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Deficits in Animal Models: Antioxidant, Enzyme Inhibitory, Molecular Docking and Behavioral Correlates.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral turbulence and is anticipated to badly affect the patient's quality of life. Previous studies revealed the neuroprotective effects of progesterone, so this study aimed to appraise the neuroprotective potentials of new derivatives of progesterone (AN-1 to AN-5).
METHODS: Subsequent to compound synthesis and structure elucidation, the in-vitro antioxidant (DPPH), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory and molecular docking studies were performed following standard procedures. The most potent compound was subjected to more detailed behavioral studies, including Y-Maze, Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and open field tests in scopolamine-induced amnesic animals.
RESULTS: In the DPPH assay, the AN-1 compound at 1000 μg/ml concentration exhibited 83.37 ± 2.03% inhibition of DPPH free radicals and an IC50 value of 24.81 μg/ml. Likewise, the compound AN-1 demonstrated 88.94 ± 1.20% inhibition against AChE and 86.78 ± 1.24% inhibition against BChE enzymes at 1000 μg/ml with IC50 values of 24.51 and 18.79 μg/ml, correspondingly. In behavioral studies, compound AN-1 demonstrated a significant decline in cognitive impairments and improved working memory as well as locomotor activities of the amnesic animals. Molecular docking studies also demonstrated that the compound AN-1 has promising inhibitory potentials against AChE and BChE enzymes by binding to their active sites. The binding energies of AN-1 with both enzymes were -7.6 Kcal/mol for AChE and -8.1 Kcal/mol for BChE.
CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, it is concluded that the derivatives of progesterone exhibit neuroprotective potential, and further research is needed to extend their neuroprotective role in the treatment of AD.",Curr Neuropharmacol
40156791,"Bromelain improved cognitive & mood behaviors, oxido-inflammatory indices and cholinergic transmission in scopolamine-induced neurotoxicity in male wistar rats.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with pathophysiological and psychological disturbances including cognitive decline, depression, anxiety and motor imbalance. Conventional drugs for managing AD do not address associated non-neurocognitive co-morbidities, hence the need to investigate alternative therapies especially from plants. The neuroprotective benefits of bromelain have been identified, but its impacts on scopolamine-induced neurotoxicity is yet to be elucidated. Twenty-Five male rats were separated randomly into 5 groups: Control (normal saline; 1ml/kg); Scopolamine (i.p; 1mg/kg); Bromelain (50mg/kg); Scopolamine + Bromelain; Scopolamine + Donepezil (reference drug, 1mg/kg). Neurobehavioral paradigms (novel object recognition, elevated plus maze, forced swimming and open field tests were assessed, followed by biochemical (MDA, SOD, AChE, NO, Total protein & IL-1b) assay in the PFC. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (Tukey's posthoc.). Values with p<0.05 were considered significant. Scopolamine reduced memory index (P<0.01) (cognitive function), ambulatory & rearing activities (P<0.05) (motor behavior), open arm duration (P<0.001) (anxiety-like behavior) & increased immobility time (P<0.05) (depressive-like behavior). Exposure to scopolamine also led to significant reduction in the prefrontal cortical levels of SOD (P<0.05) while increasing MDA (P<0.05), acetylcholinesterase (P<0.01) and IL-1β (P<0.05). However, levels of NO and total protein were not significantly altered. In contrast, intervention with bromelain or donepezil significantly reversed most of the behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by scopolamine. Bromelain compared favorably with donepezil in improving memory decline and other non-cognitive dysfunctions associated with scopolamine exposure. This could have resulted from modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and cholinergic transmission.

40034529,Normative data for the CERAD verbal episodic memory tests in a sample of older illiterate Korean women.,"BACKGROUND: Verbal episodic memory tests in the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery require literacy. While modified administrations are provided for illiterate individuals, there are no norms for evaluating the performance of illiterate subjects.
OBJECTIVE: Assessing the performance of illiterate individuals has limitations, since existing norms were developed on data from literate populations. The purpose of this study is to provide normative data for illiterate Korean older women.
METHODS: The participants analyzed in this study were all illiterate. Among a sample of 109 non-demented older adults recruited from community centers for dementia, only 9 were men. Thus, the current analysis developed norms for women. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participants' characteristics and test scores. Linear regressions were conducted to examine the effect of age on verbal episodic memory tests.
RESULTS: Age was found to be significantly associated with performance on all word list tests. Age was divided into two groups based on the average value for sufficient sample size and showed a significant difference in test performance: 60-75, ≥76 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating illiterate women using existing standards has the limitation of underestimating their performance relative to their actual skills. The present normative data are expected to enable researchers and clinicians to more accurately evaluate the results of the three verbal episodic memory tests, including the Word List Memory, Word List Recall, and Word List Recognition in older illiterate Korean women.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

40145985,Neuropsychiatric symptoms and apolipoprotein E genotypes in neurocognitive disorders.,"Complex genetic relationships between neurodegenerative disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been shown, suggesting shared pathogenic mechanisms and emphasizing the potential for developing common therapeutic targets. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and their corresponding protein (APOE) isoforms may influence the biophysical properties of the cell membrane lipid bilayer. However, the role of APOE in central nervous system pathophysiology extended beyond its lipid transport function. In the present review article, we analyzed the links existing between APOE genotypes and the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative and vascular diseases. APOE genotypes (APOE ε2, APOE ε3, and APOE ε4) were implicated in common mechanisms underlying a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic Alzheimer's disease, synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and Lewy body disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. These shared pathways often involved neuroinflammation, abnormal protein accumulation, or responses to acute detrimental events. Across these conditions, APOE variants are believed to contribute to the modulation of inflammatory responses, the regulation of amyloid and tau pathology, as well as the clearance of proteins such as α-synuclein. The bidirectional interactions among APOE, amyloid and mitochondrial metabolism, immunomodulatory effects, neuronal repair, and remodeling underscored the complexity of APOE's role in neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with these conditions since from early phases of cognitive impairment such as mild cognitive impairment and mild behavioral impairment. Besides APOE-specific isoforms' link to increased neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (depression, psychosis, aberrant motor behaviors, and anxiety, not apathy), the APOE ε4 genotype was also considered a significant genetic risk factor for Lewy body disease and its worse cognitive outcomes. Conversely, the APOE ε2 variant has been observed not to exert a protective effect equally in all neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, in Lewy body disease, this variant may delay disease onset, paralleling its protective role in Alzheimer's disease, although its role in frontotemporal dementia is uncertain. The APOE ε4 genotype has been associated with adverse cognitive outcomes across other various neurodegenerative conditions. In Parkinson's disease, the APOE ε4 allele significantly impacted cognitive performance, increasing the risk of developing dementia, even in cases of pure synucleinopathies with minimal co-pathology from Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, in traumatic brain injury, recovery rates varied, with APOE ε4 carriers demonstrating a greater risk of poor long-term cognitive outcomes and elevated levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, APOE ε4 influenced the age of onset and severity of stroke, as well as the likelihood of developing stroke-associated dementia, potentially due to its role in compromising endothelial integrity and promoting blood-brain barrier dysfunction.",Neural Regen Res
40147618,"Flavonoids and their role in oxidative stress, inflammation, and human diseases.","Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are important drivers in the pathogenesis and progression of many chronic diseases, such as cancers of the breast, kidney, lung, and others, autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, atherosclerosis, arrhythmia), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), mental disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), gastrointestinal disorders (inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer), and other disorders. With the increasing demand for less toxic and more tolerable therapies, flavonoids have the potential to effectively modulate the responsiveness to conventional therapy and radiotherapy. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and plant-derived beverages. Six of the twelve structurally different flavonoid subgroups are of dietary significance and include anthocyanidins (e.g. pelargonidin, cyanidin), flavan-3-ols (e.g. epicatechin, epigallocatechin), flavonols (e.g. quercetin, kaempferol), flavones (e.g. luteolin, baicalein), flavanones (e.g. hesperetin, naringenin), and isoflavones (daidzein, genistein). The health benefits of flavonoids are related to their structural characteristics, such as the number and position of hydroxyl groups and the presence of C2C3 double bonds, which predetermine their ability to chelate metal ions, terminate ROS (e.g. hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton reaction), and interact with biological targets to trigger a biological response. Based on these structural characteristics, flavonoids can exert both antioxidant or prooxidant properties, modulate the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes and the expression and activation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)), induce apoptosis and autophagy, and target key signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Bcl-2 family of proteins. This review aims to briefly discuss the mutually interconnected aspects of oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms, such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, DNA damage, and the mechanism and resolution of inflammation. The major part of this article discusses the role of flavonoids in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, two common components of many human diseases.

40038127,Development of amyloid β (1-42) certified reference material NMIJ CRM 6210-a.,"Amyloid β is a well-known peptide biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Various methods for amyloid β such as immunological assays have been reported. It is important to establish metrological traceability using a certified reference material (CRM) at the highest level in the calibration hierarchy to assess equivalence of measured values obtained from each method. Herein, we developed a CRM for amyloid β, named as NMIJ CRM 6210-a, with a concentration traceable to the International System of Units (SI). This CRM comprises a lyophilized synthetic peptide with a human amyloid β (1-42) sequence (hereafter, amyloid β) and includes oxidated, deamidated, and isomerized forms of amyloid β. Two certified values were assigned for the mass concentration of total amyloid β (a mixture of amyloid β and its oxidized, deamidated, and isomerized forms) and amyloid β, determined via amino acid analyses with two different hydrolysis methods with different liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods coupled to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry on the reconstituted solution of the candidate material with (1.00 ± 0.01) g of 0.1% ammonia aqueous solution. The quantitative results obtained from amino acid analyses were converted into mass concentration using the density and molar mass, resulting in certified values of (46 ± 11) mg/L for total amyloid β and (42.6 ± 7.0) mg/L for amyloid β, respectively. The amyloid β content in total amyloid β was determined by calculating the relative area percentage using liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection.

It is often misdiagnosed because of its rarity and similarity with other diseases. We aimed to comprehensively investigate the clinical, radiological, pathological, and prognostic features of general paresis, and compare it with other dementias. Between August 2019 and January 2024, patients were recruited from a Memory Clinic Setting of National Center for Neurological Disorders in China. Participants underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging, and were followed after treatment. Comparative analysis was conducted on clinical features and neuropsychiatric assessments, while brain image features were investigated using linear regression models and SuStaIn models. Seventy-eight patients were included, with 90% being male. The median duration from symptom onset to the first diagnostic visit was 15 months. Sixty-three patients were followed for an average of 1.4 years. Cognitive impairment emerged as the most common symptom, with half of the patients co-existed with motor symptoms. Impairment across all cognitive domains accompanied by positive psychiatric symptoms raised suspicion for general paresis, and distinguishing it from Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and anti-LGI1 encephalitis-related dementia. Common imaging abnormalities in general paresis included whole brain atrophy and cortical hypointensity. The hippocampal-predominant and hippocampal-sparing atrophy subtypes were identified. Autoimmune responses in general paresis were demonstrated through the detection of autoimmune encephalitis antibodies in 11% of patients. Pathological amyloid changes were observed in 26% of patients, while elevated total tau levels were found in 30%. Seventy percent of patients showed improvement following treatment, with a reduction in the number of symptoms observed across all cases. This study identifies specific clinical syndromes and radiological features of general paresis and refines the understanding of its prognosis. We provide clues to distinguish general paresis from other dementias, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.

In the present paper, we sum up the protective effect of acupuncture therapy from 1) cell apoptosis (for example, improving post-surgery cognition impairment, traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke by relieving mitochondrial damage, activating mitochondrial autophagy, increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, and thus reducing cell apoptosis ), 2) cell autophagy (for example, improving post-surgery cognition impairment, traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke by relieving mitochondrial damage, activating mitochondrial autophagy, and increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, and thus reducing cell apoptosis), 3) pyroptosis (for example, inhibiting abnormally-activated inflammasomes, and caspase and gasdermin D activity to remit pyroptosis in the treatment of stroke, depression, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease animal models), 4) ferroptosis (for instance, regulating iron ion metabolism, relieving lipid peroxidation damage, and thus playing a brain protection role in the treatment of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke animal models), 5) necroptosis (inhibiting necrotic apoptosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 in intracerebral hemorrhage rats), and so on. We believe that along with the continuous development of brain science, artificial intelligence, big data and other new concepts and new technologies, it is expected to expand and improve the research level and quality of acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of encephalopathy through faster, more accurate and more comprehensive methods, which will help promote the modern interpretation of the brain protective effect of traditional acupuncture from the perspective of acupuncture regulation of PCD.",Zhen Ci Yan Jiu
40063315,Biomarker Profile in Peripheral Blood Cells Related to Alzheimer's Disease.,"In a healthy brain, neuroinflammation, controlled by the main intermediary for the immune response microglia and astrocytes, contributes to maintain physiological functions such as secretion of neurotrophic factors, removal of cell tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) debris, and local homeostasis.

N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) levels were quantified with a colorimetric assay. RNA pull-down assay examined METTL3, IGF2BP2, and IκBα mRNA binding. IGF2BP expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. Learning and memory abilities were evaluated using morris water maze (MWM) test and novel object recognition (NOR) test. Inflammation-related proteins were detected using IF.
RESULTS: Stimulation with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> led to microglia M1 polarization, upregulation of inflammation-related proteins, and exacerbation of neuronal injury and apoptosis, along with increased p-tau expression in neurons. METTL3/IGF2BP2 modulated IκBα m<sup>6</sup>A modification through binding to IκBα mRNA, enhancing its expression. Enhanced METTL3 or IGF2BP2 expression suppressed M1 polarization, inflammation, and neuronal apoptosis in microglia, reversed by knockdown of IκBα. AD model mice exhibited cognitive impairments, neuroinflammation, and elevated M1 polarization. METTL3 or IGF2BP2 overexpression improved cognitive function, reduced neuroinflammation, and inhibited M1 polarization, and this effect was similarly reversed by knockdown of IκBα.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the METTL3/IGF2BP2/IκBα axis is involved in neuroinflammation in AD by modulating microglia M1/M2 polarization, which sheds light on the treatment of AD.",Neurochem Int
40125337,Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of fenugreek in preventing mice model of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the most prevalent form of dementia. Fenugreek seeds possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, making them valuable therapeutic agents in managing neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the primary biological pathways and specific mechanisms underlying the protective effects of fenugreek in preventing mice of AD by employing bioinformatics and experimental verification.
METHODS: We administered fenugreek extract as an intervention in mice model of AD and then assessed their cognitive ability and histopathological changes. We predicted the key target genes associated with fenugreek action on AD and the main biological pathways using the bioinformatics method. Furthermore, we observed the different expression of target genes by western blot (WB).
RESULTS: The bioinformatics analysis revealed a strong correlation between fenugreek and AD. The behavioral experiments confirmed that fenugreek improved the behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in mice with AD. The histopathology revealed significant changes that fenugreek can inhabit Nissl bodies. Western blot experiments confirmed that fenugreek exerted statistically significant modulatory effects on the levels of inflammatory proteins [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-1β] and oxidative stress-related proteins (amyloid-β protein precursor, apolipoprotein E, and presenilin 1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that fenugreek might be involved in the AD pathway and effectively prevented the progression of AD through significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40033579,Dual-Phase C-11 PiB PET Images for Detecting Tau Pathology in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly, and frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease and tau pathology. Dual-phase <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET detects amyloid deposition and cerebral perfusion changes and may have diagnostic value for identifying tau in CAA.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with probable CAA for dynamic PiB and AV1451 scans. We compared early-phase (0-6 min after tracer injection) and late-phase (40-70 min) PiB PET between the tau(+) and tau(-) groups (based on AV1451 PET) and investigated their diagnostic values for detecting tau.
RESULTS: CAA/tau(+) had lower early-phase temporal PiB uptake than CAA/tau(-) (p = 0.014) and higher late-phase uptake in the whole cortex and temporal and parietal lobes (all p < 0.05). Early-phase temporal PiB SUVR correlated with tau burden (r = -0.34, p = 0.038). Using Youden's cut-off, early-phase and late-phase PET had sensitivities of 55% and 80% and specificities of 85% and 65% for detecting tau, respectively. Combining early- and late-phase scans provided a rule-out sensitivity of 90% and rule-in specificity of 100% for tau pathology in CAA.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual-phase <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET represents a reliable approach for assessing tau and could potentially identify CAA patients for tau biomarker testing.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol
40126739,Innovative approaches in acetylcholinesterase inhibition: a pathway to effective Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are essential in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, as they prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby enhancing cognitive function.

40054233,Age at diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and subsequent risk of dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence regarding the association between Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) onset age and risk of incident dementia remains unexplored. The study sought to examine whether younger onset age of OSA is associated with a higher risk of incident dementia.
METHODS: This cohort study, based on the UK Biobank's prospective population data, excluded 445,023 participants due to baseline dementia diagnoses, incomplete covariate information, or pre-OSA onset dementia over a 12.6-year median follow-up. The research applied Cox regression and propensity score matching to explore the relationship between sleep apnea onset age and later development of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: In a controlled study contrasting those without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), those suffering from OSA showed markedly higher risks for developing all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD), with hazard ratios (HR) of 4.243 (95% CI: 3.678-4.897), 5.668 (95% CI: 4.380-7.336), and 6.064 (95% CI: 4.008-9.175) respectively. Following adjustment with propensity score matching, OSA patients younger than 52 presented the highest risk of all-cause dementia, with an adjusted HR of 2.256 (95% CI: 1.901-3.747). This trend was consistent for early-onset AD and VD in the same age group.
CONCLUSION: Younger age at OSA onset was associated with increased risk of dementia. Individuals with an onset age of OSA before 52 years of age may represent a particularly vulnerable population for dementia irrespective of subtypes and need careful monitoring and timely intervention to attenuate subsequent risk of incident dementia.",J Psychiatr Res
40129107,"Sulfonamide-Bearing Pyrazolone Derivatives as Multitarget Therapeutic Agents: Design, Synthesis, Characterization, Biological Evaluation, In Silico ADME/T Profiling and Molecular Docking Study.","The research and design of new inhibitors for the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma through inhibition of cholinesterases (ChEs; acetylcholinesterase, AChE and butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) and carbonic anhydrase enzymes are among the important targets. Here, a series of novel sulfonamide-bearing pyrazolone derivatives (1a-f and 2a-f) were successfully synthesized and characterized by using spectroscopic and analytical methods. The inhibitory activities of these newly synthesized compounds were evaluated both in vitro and in silico for their effect on carbonic anhydrases (hCA I and hCA II isoenzymes) and ChEs. The in vitro studies showed that these novel compounds demonstrated potential inhibitory activity, with K<sub>I</sub> values covering the following ranges: 18.03 ± 2.86-75.54 ± 4.91 nM for hCA I, 24.84 ± 1.57-85.42 ± 6.60 nM for hCA II, 7.45 ± 0.98-16.04 ± 1.60 nM for AChE, and 34.78 ± 5.88-135.70 ± 17.39 nM for BChE. Additionally, many of these compounds showed promising inhibitory activity, and some showed higher potency than reference compounds. While the in silico studies have also identified the potential binding positions of these compounds, using the crystal structures of hCA I, II, AChE and BChE receptors. The varying affinities demonstrated by these designed compounds for ChEs and hCA isoenzymes show that these compounds could hold promise as potential alternative agents for selectively inhibiting ChEs and hCAs in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma.",Pharmacol Res Perspect
40065171,Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .",Nat Med
40141040,Next Generation Sequencing Analysis in Patients Affected by Parkinson's Disease and Correlation Between Genotype and Phenotype in Selected Clinical Cases.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the most frequent movement disorder and is second only to Alzheimer's Disease as the most frequent neurodegenerative pathology. Early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is less common and may be characterized by genetic predisposition. NGS testing might be useful in the diagnostic assessment of these patients. A panel of eight genes (SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ1, LRRK2, FBXO7, GBA1 and HFE) was validated and used as a diagnostic tool. A total of 38 in sequence EOPD patients of the Parkinson's Disease Unit of our Hospital Institution were tested. In addition, the number of the hexanucleotide repeats of the C9ORF72 gene and the frequency of main HFE mutations were evaluated. Six patients were carriers of likely pathogenic mutations in heterozygosity in the analyzed genes, one of them presented mutations in association and another had a complex genetic background. Their clinical symptoms were correlated with their genotypes. In the cohort of patients, only the p.Cys282Tyr of HFE was significantly decreased in the dominant model and allele contrast comparison. Only one patient with one allele of C9ORF72 containing 10 repeats was identified and clinically described. The clinical signs of sporadic and monogenic PD are often very similar; for this reason, it is fundamental to correlate genotypes and phenotypes, as we tried to describe here, to better classify PD patients with the aim to deepen our knowledge in the molecular mechanisms involved and collaborate in reaching a personalized management and treatment.",Int J Mol Sci
40114234,Impact of sleep apnea on alzheimer's disease in relation to sex: an 8-year longitudinal follow-up study of a nationwide cohort.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the association between sleep apnea and incident dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer type [DAT] and vascular dementia) and whether differences in the effects of sleep apnea on dementia depend on sex. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether obesity affects the sex-specific relationship between sleep apnea and dementia.
METHODS: We used de-identified data on patients with sleep apnea and a control group aged ≥ 50 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. After propensity score matching to balance age and sex between the patient and control groups, 30,111 individuals with sleep apnea (patient group) and 121,528 individuals without sleep apnea (control group) were included. To investigate the impact of sleep apnea on the development of dementia, we used Cox proportional hazards regression after controlling for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Sleep apnea was predictive of developing DAT in both women (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.44, p < 0.001) and men (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24, p = 0.012). The adverse effects of sleep apnea on DAT were more prominent in women than in men (p = 0.015 for sleep apnea×sex). Furthermore, obesity affected the sex-specific relationship between sleep apnea and DAT. Specifically, the adverse effects of obese sleep apnea on the DAT were more pronounced in women than in men (p = 0.002 for obese sleep apnea×sex). In contrast, there were no differences in the effects of non-obese sleep apnea on DAT between women and men (p = 0.667 for non-obese sleep apnea×sex).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight sex differences in the adverse effects of sleep apnea on DAT. Furthermore, these results suggest that sex-specific strategies for controlling sleep apnea are necessary to prevent DAT.",Alzheimers Res Ther
40164887,3-(3-(diethylamino)propyl)-2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)thiazolidin-4-one Attenuates Scopolamine-induced Cognitive Impairment in Rats: Insights Into Neuroprotective Effects.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by memory decline, dysregulation in cholinergic and purinergic signaling, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Current treatments are limited, highlighting the need for new compounds to prevent or delay AD progression. Thiazolidinones have emerged as promising candidates due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticholinesterase properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3-(3-(diethylamino)propyl)-2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)thiazolidin-4-one (DS27) in a rat model of scopolamine-induced memory deficits. Male rats were divided into groups: I - Control, II - Scopolamine (SCO) (1 mg/kg), III - SCO and DS27 (5 mg/kg), IV - SCO and DS27 (10 mg/kg), V - SCO and donepezil (5 mg/kg). The animals were treated orally with DS27 or donepezil for seven days. On the 8th day, they underwent the open field test and inhibitory avoidance training, followed by intraperitoneal administration SCO. Twenty-four hours later, an inhibitory avoidance test was conducted. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory and purinergic parameters were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, lymphocytes, and liver. DS27 prevented memory deficits, alterations in AChE activity, and oxidative damage induced by SCO in brain structures. Additionally, DS27 prevented SCO-induced decrease in IL-10 levels, and increase in IL-6, and TNF-α expression in the cerebral cortex, and normalized ATP and ADP hydrolysis in cerebrospinal fluid and lymphocytes. DS27 did not induce oxidative stress in the liver or alter serum biochemical parameters. These findings suggest that DS27 has significant neuroprotective properties and could be a promising alternative for treating neurodegenerative diseases like AD.",Mol Neurobiol

40085351,Systematic Identification of Mitochondrial Signatures in Alzheimer's Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a shared feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), linked through overlapping pathways of hypoxia and immune dysregulation. Our study integrated transcriptomic and genetic analyses to uncover mitochondria-related mechanisms underlying these diseases. By analyzing multiple AD and IBD datasets through differential expression gene (DEG) analyses, biological pathway enrichment, and co-expression module construction, we identified hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as a central risk factor for both conditions. Key findings revealed several mitochondrial-related genes shared between AD and IBD, including BCL6, PFKFB3, NDUFS3, and COX5B, which serve as critical regulators bridging mitochondrial and immune pathways. Drug enrichment analyses using Drug Signatures Database (DsigDB) and the Connectivity Map (cMAP) identified promising therapeutic candidates, including decitabine, DMOG, and estradiol, targeting shared regulators such as BCL6, PFKFB3, MAFF, and TGFBI. These drugs demonstrated potential to modulate mitochondrial autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), pathways enriched in the constructed interaction network with BCL6 and PFKFB3 as central nodes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis further identified MAP1LC3A as significantly associated with increased risk for both AD and IBD, while NME1 emerged as strongly protective, suggesting their roles as therapeutic targets. Our findings underscore hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as a unifying mechanism in AD and IBD, mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). By identifying key mitochondria-associated genes and pathways, this study highlights innovative therapeutic targets and contributes to a deeper understanding of the gut-brain interplay in neurodegeneration and chronic inflammation. These insights pave the way for precision medicine strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and IBD.",Mol Neurobiol
40144589,Neuroplastic effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS): from mechanisms to clinical trials.,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique with the potential for inducing neuroplasticity and enhancing cognitive and clinical outcomes. A unique feature of tACS, compared to other stimulation modalities, is that it modulates brain activity by entraining neural activity and oscillations to an externally applied alternating current. While many studies have focused on online effects during stimulation, growing evidence suggests that tACS can induce sustained after-effects, which emphasizes the potential to induce long-term neurophysiological changes, essential for therapeutic applications. In the first part of this review, we discuss how tACS after-effects could be mediated by four non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), where the timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes strengthens or weakens synaptic connections. Second, spike-phase coupling and oscillation phase as mediators of plasticity. Third, homeostatic plasticity, emphasizing the importance of neural activity to operate within dynamic physiological ranges. Fourth, state-dependent plasticity, which highlights the importance of the current brain state in modulatory effects of tACS. In the second part of this review, we discuss tACS applications in clinical trials targeting neurological and psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Evidence suggests that repeated tACS sessions, optimized for individual oscillatory frequencies and combined with behavioral interventions, may result in lasting effects and enhance therapeutic outcomes. However, critical challenges remain, including the need for personalized dosing, improved current modeling, and systematic investigation of long-term effects. In conclusion, this review highlights the mechanisms and translational potential of tACS, emphasizing the importance of bridging basic neuroscience and clinical research to optimize its use as a therapeutic tool.",Front Hum Neurosci
40054297,Conjugation with the XJB peptide enhanced neuroprotective effect of honokiol via SIRT3 modulation.,"Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and energy conversion. Dysfunctional mitochondria have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), making mitochondrial improvement a promising therapeutic approach. SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase, modulates mitochondrial function by deacetylating associated proteins. This study aimed to enhance the activity of honokiol, a natural SIRT3 modulator, and improve mitochondrial function for neuroprotective activity, using mitochondria targeting strategy. We synthesized mitochondrial targeting peptide conjugates using XJB as a carrier and found that honokiol conjugates exhibited lower toxicity and higher activity on neuronal injury models in vitro and in vivo (Zebrafish model) at lower concentrations compared to honokiol. The neuroprotective mechanism may involve the activation of cellular autophagy-related pathways, promotion of SIRT3 pathway activation, and up-regulation of mitochondrial fusion-associated protein Mfn-1 expression under damaged conditions. This study offers a promising approach for developing anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) natural product derivatives based on SIRT3 regulation.",Eur J Med Chem
40042673,Stable EEG Spatiospectral Patterns Estimated in Individuals by Group Information Guided NMF.,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations occur across a wide range of spatial and spectral scales, and analysis of neural rhythmic variability have attracted recent attention as markers of development, intelligence, cognitive states and neural disorders. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG) spectral analysis. However, existing group NMF methods have not explicitly optimized the individual-level EEG components derived from group-level components. To preserve EEG characteristics at the individual level while establishing correspondence of patterns across participants, we present a novel framework for obtaining subject-specific EEG components, which we term group-information guided NMF (GIGNMF). In this framework, group information captured by standard NMF at the group level is utilized as guidance to compute individual subject-specific components through a multi-objective optimization strategy. Specifically, we propose a three-stage framework: first, group-level consensus EEG patterns are derived using standard group NMF tools; second, an optimal procedure is implemented to determine the number of components; and finally, the group-level EEG patterns serve as references in a new one-unit NMF employing a multi-objective optimization solver. We test the performance of the algorithm on both synthetic signals and real EEG recordings obtained from Alzheimer's disease data. Our results highlight the feasibility of using GIGNMF to identify EEG spatiotemporal patterns and present novel individual electrophysiological characteristics that enhance our understanding of cognitive function and contribute to clinical neuropathological diagnosis.",Brain Topogr
40060041,Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Confers Neuroprotection and Restores Microglial Homeostasis in a Tauopathy Mouse Model.,"BACKGROUND: The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are derivatives of the arachidonic acid metabolism with anti-inflammatory activities. However, their efficacy is limited due to the rapid hydrolasis by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Accordingly, inhibition of sEH has been shown to stabilize the EETs and dampen neuroinflammation in Aβ mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of the sEH-EET signaling pathway in other cell types of the CNS and in other neurodegenerative conditions are less understood.
METHODS: Here we examined the mechanisms and the functional role of the sEH-EET axis in tauopathy by treating the PS19 mice with a small molecule sEH inhibitor TPPU and by crossing the PS19 mice with Ephx2 (gene encoding sEH) knockout mice, followed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), biochemical and immunohistochemical characterization, and behavioral analysis. We also tested the effect of the sEH-EET pathway in primary microglia cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons that develop seeding-induced Tau inclusions.
RESULTS: We show that sEH inhibition improved cognitive function, rescued neuronal cell loss, and reduced Tau pathology and microglia reactivity. snRNA-seq revealed that TPPU treatment resulted in the upregulation of actin cytoskeleton and excitatory synaptic pathway genes. Treating the human iPSC-derived neurons with TPPU led to enhanced synaptic density without affecting Tau accumulation, indicating a cell-autonomous effect of sEH blockade in neuroprotection. Further, sEH inhibition reversed disease-associated and interferon-response microglia states in PS19 mice and EET supplementation enhanced Tau phagocytosis and clearance in primary microglia cultures.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that sEH blockade or EET augmentation confer therapeutic benefit against neurodegenerative tauopathies through parallel targeting of neuronal and microglial pathways.",Res Sq
40114204,Neonatal maternal separation causes depressive-like behavior and potentiates memory impairment induced by amyloid-β oligomers in adult mice.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory decline and mood alterations. A growing body of evidence implicates stress and other social determinants of health as potential contributors to the progressive cerebral alterations that culminate in AD. In the current study, we investigated the impact of neonatal maternal separation (MS) on the susceptibility of male and female mice to AD-associated memory impairments and depressive-like behavior in adulthood, and on brain levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotransmitters.
METHODOLOGY: Male and female Swiss mice were exposed to MS for 180 min daily from post-natal day 1 to 10. Seventy days post-MS, mice received an intracerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), and memory and mood were evaluated. Levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, serotonin, dopamine, and related metabolites were determined in the cortex and hippocampus.
RESULTS: Previous exposure to MS alone did not cause memory impairments in adult mice. Interestingly, however, MS increased the susceptibility of adult male mice to memory impairment and depressive-like behavior induced by AβOs, and potentiated the inhibitory impact of AβOs on memory in adult females. Females were more susceptible to depressive-like behavior caused by a low dose of AβOs, regardless of MS. No changes in IL-1β were found. A decrease in TNF-α was selectively found in females exposed to MS that received an infusion of 1 pmol AβOs. MS led to an increase in serotonin (5-HT) in the hippocampus of male mice, without influencing the levels of the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA. Changes in serotonin turnover were predominantly observed in the cortex of female mice. No changes in dopamine or its metabolites were induced by MS or AβOs in male or female mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal MS enhances the susceptibility of adult mice to AD-associated cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior in a sex-specific manner. This suggests that early life stress may play a role in the development of AD.",Behav Brain Funct
40023897,Natural disaster-induced dementia and cognitive decline: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Recently, some studies have noted a negative cognitive impact on individuals in the aftermath of large-scale natural disasters; however, the causal relationship between disasters and cognitive/neurodegenerative effects remains widely unexplored. This review analyzes the impact of natural disasters on the development of cognitive decline (CD), all-cause dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in disaster-affected individuals. Studies reported from their inception to August 2023 were obtained via public online databases. All data presented in this review was derived from precalculated study results, data presented within/alongside articles, or statistics calculated using data obtained by contacting the articles' authors for ancillary information. Data from 28 studies, representing 4,606,561 individuals, 158,994 CD events, 179,694 dementia events, and 47,193 AD events was included for analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates showed that natural disasters significantly increased the risk of CD (OR: 1.25, CI: 1.20-1.30), all-cause dementia (OR: 1.07, CI: 1.05-1.08), and AD (OR: 1.07, CI: 1.05-1.10) in disaster victims as opposed to less- or non-impacted individuals. The greatest effects were noted following hurricanes, earthquakes with tsunamis, and heat waves. The findings from this meta-analysis indicate that natural disasters are significantly associated with the development of CD, all-cause dementia, and AD.",Soc Sci Med
39994231,Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience. We propose a systemic ""bioenergetic capacity"", the individual ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions. Using fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker presentations of AD. Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. The estimated treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD. Furthermore, monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be achieved using existing clinical assays.",Nat Commun
40058438,Kai-Xin-San polysaccharides exert therapeutic effects on D-gal and Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced AD rats by regulating gut microbiota and metabolic profile.,"Metabolic abnormalities and gut microbiota imbalance are intricately linked to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a traditional herbal formula known for its therapeutic effects on AD. Our previous research indicated that Kai-Xin-San polysaccharide (KXS-P) exhibits a significant therapeutic impact on AD, but the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, untargeted fecal metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate the potential mechanisms by which KXS-P acts against AD. Key metabolites and gut microbial species were identified using multivariate analysis and a comprehensive examination of intestinal microecology. Our findings revealed that KXS-P improves lipid metabolism in AD rats by modulating a series of lipid molecules and bile acid levels. Additionally, KXS-P regulated gut microbiota composition and restored the symbiotic relationships within the gut microbiome. Notably, the anti-inflammatory effect of KXS-P may be related to its regulation of specific lipotypes levels and the abundance of Romboutsia, Bifidobacterium and Alloprevotella. KXS-P demonstrates the ability to alleviate symptoms of AD rats through multiple mechanisms: ① Improving lipid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis; ② Reducing neuronal and inflammatory damage; ③ Regulating the composition and symbiotic relationships of gut microbiota to preserve intestinal microecological balance.",Int J Biol Macromol
40153574,Inflammatory Bridges: Interconnections Between Alzheimer's Disease and Bone Health.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly and is characterized by complex pathogenesis. Within the unified framework of the ANT, the introduction of B (the disruption of the blood-brain barrier) facilitates communication between the brain and the periphery through the blood-brain barrier. In this context, inflammatory factors act as a bridge, and the neuroinflammation hypothesis is gaining increasing acceptance. This hypothesis involves the abnormal activation of microglia, the release of inflammatory mediators, and damage to astrocytes, which leads to blood-brain barrier impairment and subsequently triggers systemic inflammation. Bone health is associated with conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontitis. This hypothesis establishes a link between Alzheimer's disease and bone health. The present article aims to construct an inflammatory bridge between brain and bone health by summarizing the shared mechanisms between the two, specifically focusing on age-related NLRP3-induced pyroptosis, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, macrophage autophagy and lysosomal function, and calcium ion dysregulation. Additionally, it reviews the latest therapeutic approaches to explore potential clinical treatments related to the connection between Alzheimer's disease and bone health through these shared mechanisms.",Aging Dis
40104800,In-Silico Screening-Based Discovery of New Natural eEF2K Inhibitors with Neuritogenic Activity.,"Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), an atypical Ser/Thr-protein kinase that regulates neuronal protein synthesis homeostasis via an inhibitory phosphorylation of eEF2, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we employed molecular docking with an in-house natural product library of 4270 compounds, containing 2177 novel compounds and 603 new structural frameworks, to identify eEF2K inhibitors. Following virtual screening, 25 natural products were selected for in-vitro evaluation of eEF2 phosphorylation inhibition as well as protein synthesis promotion. Our findings identified that compounds 17 and 23 potently suppress eEF2K activity, increase protein synthesis, and concurrently induce neuritogenesis. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that 17 and 23 may stably bind to the eEF2K protein. Our findings highlighted 17 and 23 as new natural eEF2K inhibitors and promising candidates for promoting neural differentiation, providing potential therapeutic leads for the treatment of AD.",ACS Med Chem Lett
39979805,Interaction of genetic variants and methylation in transcript-level expression regulation in Alzheimer's disease by multi-omics data analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant public health problem and major cause of dementia. Not only genetic but epigenetic factors contribute to complex and heterogeneous molecular mechanisms underlying AD risk; in particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation can lead to dysregulation of gene expression in the AD brain. Each of these regulators has been independently studied well in AD progression, however, their interactive roles, particularly when they are located differently, still remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the interplay between SNPs and DNA methylation in regulating transcript expression levels in the AD brain through an integrative analysis of whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and methylation data measured from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
RESULTS: We identified 179 SNP-methylation combination pairs that showed statistically significant interactions associated with the expression of 67 transcripts (63 unique genes), enriched in functional pathways, including immune-related and post-synaptic assembly pathways. Particularly, a number of HLA family genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-K, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DMA) were observed as having expression changes associated with the interplay.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings especially implicate immune-related pathways as targets of these regulatory interactions. SNP-methylation interactions may thus contribute to the molecular complexity underlying immune-related pathogenies in AD patients. Our study provides a new molecular knowledge in the context of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic regulations, in that it concerns transcript expression status in AD.",BMC Genomics
40126149,Berberine Exerts Neuroprotective Effects in Alzheimer's Disease by Switching Microglia M1/M2 Polarization Through PI3K-AKT Signaling.,"Berberine (BBR), a small molecule protoberberine isoquinoline alkaloid, is easy to cross the blood-brain barrier and is a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explored the role and molecular mechanism of BBR in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to determine AD pathology-associated gene modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were also identified. GO and KEGG analyses were performed for gene function and signaling pathway annotation. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay was applied to analyze cell viability. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining assay was conducted to measure the levels of polarization markers. The production of inflammatory cytokines was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected using a ROS detection kit and a MMP Detection Kit (JC-1), respectively. AD pathology-associated DEGs were applied for GO function annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis, and the results uncovered that AD pathology was related to immune and inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure induced the M1 phenotype of microglia, and BBR suppressed LPS-induced M1 polarization and induced microglia toward M2 polarization. Through co-culture of microglia and neuronal cells, we found that BBR exerted a neuro-protective role by attenuating the injury of LPS-induced HMC3 on SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanically, BBR switched the M1/M2 phenotypes of microglia by activating PI3K-AKT signaling. In summary, BBR protected neuronal cells from activated microglia-mediated neuro-inflammation by switching the M1/M2 polarization in LPS-induced microglia via activating PI3K-AKT signaling.

40108988,Relationships between hypometabolism and both β-amyloid and tau PET in corticobasal syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology causes corticobasal syndrome (CBS) in 21%-50% of patients. Studies have assessed hypometabolism in CBS according to β-amyloid (A) positron emission tomography (PET), but the understanding of the association of both AD-tau (T) and A with hypometabolism is incomplete.
METHODS: Thirty-three CBS patients and 45 controls underwent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), flortaucipir, and Pittsburgh compound-B PET and were classified as A± and T±. FDG-PET uptake was extracted for 12 regions-of-interest in dominant (most affected) and non-dominant hemispheres and compared across A/T groups.
RESULTS: A+T+ patients had greater hypometabolism in temporo-parieto-occipital cortices than A+T- and A-T- groups, with no differences observed between the A+T- and A-T- groups. FDG asymmetry was more accentuated in A+T+ patients. Medial temporal and basal ganglia metabolism were similar across AT groups.
DISCUSSION: Amyloid and tau positivity contribute synergistically to hypometabolism and asymmetry in temporo-parieto-occipital cortices in CBS, with AD-like patterns of hypometabolism observed only in A+T+ patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid (A) and tau PET (T) status can be used to stratify CBS patients. A+T+ CBS patients show more hypometabolism in temporo-parieto-occipital cortices. Medial temporal metabolism (typical AD pattern) is similar across AT groups. Parieto-occipital cortices should be assessed when investigating AT pathology in CBS. Amyloid and tau positivity contribute synergistically to hypometabolism and asymmetry in CBS.",Alzheimers Dement
40138433,Lifespan of male and female APP/PS1 and APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately affects women, yet most preclinical research studies are male-centric. We performed lifespan analyses of male and female AD mouse models (APP/PS1 and APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup>) and their shared genetic background control (C57BL/6). Survival curves support significant sex differences between genotypes. Minimal longevity revealed increased age in male APP/PS1, and decreased age in male APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mice. Maximal longevity revealed an increased average age in males. Furthermore, median lifespan differed between sex and genotype. This study supports dimorphic survival in two mouse models of AD, emphasizing the need to examine mechanisms and treatments in both sexes.",J Alzheimers Dis

40141059,Glycosylation Regulation by TMEM230 in Aging and Autoimmunity.,"Aging is often a choice between developing cancer or autoimmune disorders, often due in part to loss of self-tolerance or loss of immunological recognition of rogue-acting tumor cells. Self-tolerance and cell recognition by the immune system are processes very much dependent on the specific signatures of glycans and glycosylated factors present on the cell plasma membrane or in the stromal components of tissue. Glycosylated factors are generated in nearly innumerable variations in nature, allowing for the immensely diverse role of these factors in aging and flexibility necessary for cellular interactions in tissue functionality. In previous studies, we showed that differential expression of TMEM230, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein was associated with specific signatures of enzymes regulating glycan synthesis and processing and glycosylation in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue using single-cell transcript sequencing. In this current study, we characterize the genes and pathways co-modulated in all cell types of the synovial tissue with the enzymes regulating glycan synthesis and processing, as well as glycosylation. Genes and biological and molecular pathways associated with hallmarks of aging were in mitochondria-dependent oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species synthesis, ER-dependent stress and unfolded protein response, DNA repair (UV response and P53 signaling pathways), and senescence, glycolysis and apoptosis regulation through PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling have been shown to play important roles in aging or neurodegeneration (such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease). We propose that the downregulation of TMEM230 and RNASET2 may represent a paradigm for the study of age-dependent autoimmune disorders due to their role in regulating glycosylation, unfolded protein response, and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling.",Int J Mol Sci
40066595,Prevalence of malnutrition in patients with Alzheimer's disease - A systematic review. The call for consistent nutritional assessment methods.,"OBJECTIVES: epidemiological data show growing numbers of patients with Alzheimer´s disease. Cognitive decline and progressive swallowing impairment lead to a significant deterioration of the nutrition status in this population. Early detection and treatment of malnutrition is important for the prognosis of the disease.
METHOD: a systematic review was conducted. Four databases such as Cochrane, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched by two independent researchers. The inclusion criteria encompass adult patients with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, studies with screening tools for nutritional assessment such as Mini-Nutritional Assessment and body mass index. Patients without diagnosis or with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease were excluded. Finally, 36 studies with 5293 participants were included to the systematic review. PRISMA protocol was followed when writing this article. Critical Appraisal tools for use in JBI Systematic Reviews were used for quality assessment.
RESULTS: 36 studies were included in this systematic review. More than half of the respondents were from Europe. According to MNA 33.97 % of participants were at risk of malnutrition, 3.74 % malnourished and more than 62 % had proper nutritional status. According to the BMI, nearly 50 % of patients were overweight or obese, 4.22 % had BMI < BMI < 18,49 kg/m2. Risk of malnutrition and malnutrition was diagnosed in 53.8 % and 8.2 % of patients assessed with Mini-Nutritional Assessment - Short Form.
CONCLUSION: the risk of malnutrition in AD is high, however, significant differences between studies can be observed due to methodological differences. Large epidemiological studies are needed with unified nutritional assessment methods for patients with Alzheimer's disease.",Nutr Hosp
40044002,Radix Hedysari Polysaccharides modulate the gut-brain axis and improve cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice.,"OBJECTIVE: Radix Hedysari Polysaccharides (RHP) are the principal bioactive constituents of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Radix Hedysari. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of RHP in both cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: HT22 cells subjected to Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>35</sub>-induced cytotoxicity were pretreated with RHP, followed by assessments of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial superoxide (mSOX) levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were orally administered RHP for 12 weeks. Behavioral assays were conducted to assess cognitive function, while metabolomic and proteomic analyses were performed to examine serum metabolic alterations and hippocampal protein expression profiles. Additionally, neuronal autophagy and gut barrier integrity were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and biomarker quantification.
RESULTS: RHP treatment significantly attenuated Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>35</sub>-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells by reducing ROS and mSOX production while preserving ΔΨm. In SAMP8 mice, RHP improved cognitive performance, preserved hippocampal mitochondrial ultrastructure, and enhanced neuronal autophagic activity. Moreover, RHP modulated serum metabolic pathways and alleviated gut barrier dysfunction, suggesting a role in gut-brain axis regulation.
CONCLUSION: RHP ameliorates cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice, potentially through its modulation of systemic metabolism, mitigation of neuronal mitochondrial damage, and restoration of gut barrier integrity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of RHP in AD intervention and warrant further investigation into its mechanistic underpinnings.",Int J Biol Macromol
40075143,NLRP3 inflammasome in neuroinflammation and central nervous system diseases.,"Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important intracellular multiprotein complex composed of the innate immune receptor NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC, and the protease caspase-1. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can induce pyroptosis and the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, thus playing a central role in immune and inflammatory responses. Recent studies have revealed that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in the brain to induce neuroinflammation, leading to further neuronal damage and functional impairment, and contributes to the pathological process of various neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In this review, we summarize the important role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and the pathological course of CNS diseases and discuss potential approaches to target the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of CNS diseases.",Cell Mol Immunol
40124046,"Synthesis, Pharmacological Evaluation, and Molecular Modeling of Phthalimide Derivatives as Monoamine Oxidase and Cholinesterase Dual Inhibitors.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dementia and cognitive decline, associated with synaptic loss and degeneration of cholinergic neurons. New multitarget inhibitors for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes are emerging as a potential treatment strategy for AD. Herein, we synthesized a series of N-benzyl-substituted biaryl phthalimide derivatives (3a-3m) encompassing potentially therapeutically active arenes/heteroarenes to serve as multitarget compounds for treating AD. To improve their binding affinity as well as inhibitory activity against ChE and MAO target proteins, comparable molecular structures were synthesized bearing electron-donating, electron-withdrawing, heterocyclic, and fluorinated moieties for a comprehensive SAR. In vitro evaluation of synthesized compounds against cholinesterases (AChE/BChE) and monoamine oxidases (MAO-A/MAO-B) revealed that compound 3e had good potency against AChE (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.24 μM) and BChE (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.29 μM), while compound 3f had the highest inhibition of MAO-B (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.09 μM). Selected compounds (3e,f) showed no cytotoxicity against the neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) and normal human embryonic HEK-293 cells. Moreover, they showed high blood-brain barrier penetration (PAMPA assay) and reversible MAO-B inhibitory activity (ex vivo). In molecular docking studies, compounds 3e and 3f displayed the highest binding affinity with ChEs and MAO-B, respectively. In silico ADMET studies and MD simulation studies were also carried out for the most potent derivatives (3e and 3f), suggesting their strong potential as anti-Alzheimer agents.",ACS Omega
40008191,Feasibility of F-18 radiolabeled brain-penetrable bi-specific antibody radioligands for in vivo PET imaging of tauopathy.,"PET imaging offers promise for earlier detection and prognostication of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, antibody-based constructs that penetrate the CNS via the transferrin receptor (TfR) have improved tau-selectivity, something that currently limits small molecule tau PET radiotracers. However, it remains unclear if the slow pharmacokinetics of these constructs (MW &gt;50 kDa) limit target binding detection within the time window available for an F-18 based radiotracer. We synthesized three radio-probes by conjugating [<sup>18</sup>F]SFB with individual bi-specific antibody constructs: 1) a full-size IgG tau antibody conjugated with a TfR fragment (TAUb), 2) a tau-scFv bispecific antibody (TAUs), and 3) an Aβ-scFv bispecific antibody (Aβs). We scanned a series of sex- and age-matched wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice with tauopathy (PS19). Each paired study consisted of three sets of PET/CT scans: an initial low dose dynamic scan followed by two static scans at 8 h and 12 h after injection of a high dose of the same probe. For TAUs probes, the whole brain uptake was higher in PS19 mice (0.0684 ± 0.0273% ID cc<sup>-1</sup>, n = 5) compared to WT (0.0513 ± 0.0197% ID cc<sup>-1</sup>, n = 4) though the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.56). Regional quantification analysis provides supporting evidence that TAUs displayed higher specific binding over Aβs in brain regions of PS19 mice. There was net accumulation of all three probes between 8 h and 12 h, suggesting that F-18 radiolabeled bi-specific antibody constructs may not adequately quantitate deposition of tau aggregates within the available time window for F-18, limited by slow pharmacokinetics and lack of a suitable reference region.",RSC Med Chem
39994172,Alzheimer's disease with depression: clinical characteristics and potential mechanisms involving orexin and brain atrophy.,"This study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics and alteration of orexinergic level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the volumes of brain grey and white matters, and investigate the roles of orexinergic level on the association between brain atrophy and depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The demographic variables of 156 participants were collected. Orexinergic level in CSF and the volumes of brain grey and white matters were evaluated. The correlations of orexinergic level in CSF with depression and brain volume in AD patients were analyzed. The mediating effect of orexinergic level in CSF on the association between brain atrophy and depression in AD patients was investigated. The joint predictive value of orexinergic level in CSF and brain volume for depression in AD patients was established. AD with depression patients showed significantly elevated levels of orexin A and orexin B in CSF; orexin A level in CSF was positively correlated with HAMD score in AD patients. The elevated orexin A level in CSF mediated 49.6% of total association between the decreased grey matter volume of right dorsal medial thalamic nucleus and depression, and 50.3% of total association between the reduced white matter volume of left amygdala and depression. Combinations of above parameters could predict depression in AD patients with a significantly high area under the curve (AUC = 0.841). Therefore, the elevated orexin A level in CSF mediates its effect on the atrophy of the right dorsal medial thalamic nucleus and the white matter of the left amygdala, eventually alleviating depression in AD.",Transl Psychiatry
40131110,"""Fill States"": PET-derived Markers of the Spatial Extent of Alzheimer Disease Pathology.","Background Alzheimer disease (AD) progression can be monitored by tracking intensity changes in PET standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. The spatial extent (""fill state"") of these three hallmark pathologic abnormalities may serve as critical pathophysiologic information, pending further investigation. Purpose To examine the clinical utility and increase the accessibility of PET-derived fill states. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of two prospective studies used data from two independent cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Tau Propagation over Time study (T-POT). Each cohort comprised amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals (controls) and patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or probable-AD dementia. Fill states of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration were computed as the percentages of significantly abnormal voxels relative to controls across PET scans. Fill states and SUV ratios were compared across stages (Kruskal-Wallis H test, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) and tested for association with the severity of cognitive impairment (Spearman correlation, multivariate regression analysis). Additionally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to estimate fill states from patients' PET scans without requiring controls. Results The ADNI cohort included 324 individuals (mean age, 72 years ± 6.8 [SD]; 173 [53%] female), and the T-POT cohort comprised 99 individuals (mean age, 66 years ± 8.7; 63 [64%] female). Higher fill states were associated with higher stages of cognitive impairment (P &lt; .001), and tau and neurodegeneration fill states showed higher diagnostic performance for cognitive impairment compared with SUV ratio (P &lt; .05) across cohorts. Similarly, all fill states were negatively correlated with cognitive performance (P &lt; .001) and uniquely characterized the degree of cognitive impairment even after adjustment for SUV ratio (P &lt; .05). The CNN estimated amyloid and tau accurately, but not neurodegeneration fill states. Conclusion Fill states provided reliable markers of AD progression, potentially improving early detection, staging, and monitoring of AD in clinical practice and trials beyond SUV ratio.

40043618,"MPO and its role in cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders: An update.","Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme that contains a heme group, found mostly in neutrophils and in small amounts in monocytes and plays a major role in their anti-microbial activity. However, excessive levels of MPO have been linked to various disorders and identified as a major cause of tissue destruction. Inhibiting its activity can reduce the severity and extent of tissue damage. Over activity of MPO during chronic inflammation has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis by inducing a hyper-mutagenic environment through oxidant interaction with DNA, causing DNA modification. Vascular endothelium is one of the most important targets of MPO and high levels have been associated with increased rates of cardiomyopathy, ischemic stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it may be considered a therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. MPO also participates in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, an increase in MPO levels has been observed in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's, Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, active MPO is mostly found in the location of beta amyloids and microglia. Therefore, targeting MPO may be a potential treatment and prevention strategy for neurological disorders. This review will discuss MPO's physiological and pathological role in cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun

Indian medicinal herbs notably, Withania somnifera, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, and Clitoria ternatea are traditionally utilized for their memory-enhancing properties.
OBJECTIVE: We computationally investigated the therapeutic potential of four nootropic herbs by uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying their treatment for AD.
METHODS: Cheminformatics, pharmacokinetics, and system pharmacology studies were carried out to predict the phytocompounds drug-like properties, protein targets, targets functional association and enrichment analysis. A comparative study was performed with phytocompounds and FDA-approved drugs. Investigation on the expression of protein targets in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of the AD brain was performed. Network was constructed to depict the interaction between phytocompounds, drugs, and molecular targets.
RESULTS: Through comparative analysis, we found that the phytocompounds shared common targets with both FDA drugs and drugs under clinical trials. We identified potential active compounds notably, Withaferin A, Withanolide-D, Withanolide-E, Withanolide-G, and Humulene epoxide II, that can combat AD. Interestingly, the enzyme inhibition scores of the identified drugs were much higher than FDA-approved drugs. In addition, regulatory proteins such as AβPP, acetylcholinesterase, BACE1, and PTPN1 were the targets of 8, 16, 9, and 22 phytocompounds, respectively. Nonetheless, AR and CYP19A, were the primary targets of most phytocompounds.

METHODS: Participants (n = 278) were AD patients' offspring from the Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention study. Cognitively unimpaired-decliners (CU-D) were based on a linear regression model. In a subsample with MRI (n = 220), we examined relationships of CU-D with white matter (WM) microstructure (fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and cortical volume in brain regions commonly affected in AD.
RESULTS: CU-D participants had lower FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) (p = < 0.001) and higher MD in the SLF (p = < 0.001), and cingulum adjacent to the corpus callosum (p = < 0.001) and genu (p = 0.006) compared to cognitively unimpaired-stable (CU-S) participants.

40086421,Sex and APOE4-specific links between cardiometabolic risk factors and white matter alterations in individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early detection of pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered significant attention in the last few decades as interventions aiming to prevent progression will likely be most effective when initiated early. White matter (WM) alterations are among the earliest changes in AD, yet limited work has comprehensively characterized the effects of AD risk factors on WM. In older adults with a family history of AD, we investigated the sex-specific and APOE genotype-related relationships between WM microstructure and risk factors. Multiple MRI-derived metrics were integrated using a multivariate approach based on the Mahalanobis distance (D2). To uncover the specific biological underpinnings of these WM alterations, we then extracted the contribution of each MRI feature to D2 in significant clusters. Lastly, the links between WM D2 and cognition were explored. WM D2 in several regions was associated with high systolic blood pressure, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin, and low cholesterol, in both males and females. APOE4 + displayed a distinct risk pattern, with LDL-cholesterol having a detrimental effect only in carriers, and this pattern was linked to immediate memory performance. Myelination was the main mechanism underlying WM alterations. Our findings reveal that combined exposure to multiple cardiometabolic risk factors negatively impacts microstructural health, which may subsequently affect cognition. Notably, APOE4 carriers exhibited a different risk pattern, especially in the role of LDL, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms in this group.",Neurobiol Aging
40168720,"Glycosyl terpenoid-rich fraction of TeMac™ attenuates oxidative stress, inhibits cholinesterases enzyme activities, and protects brain against scopolamine-induced histopathological alterations in rats.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commonly diagnosed form of senile dementia, with limited therapeutic options. Neuronal damage is caused by factors secreted by inflammatory cells but also, the lack of antioxidants to prevent oxidative stress and help maintain neuronal integrity, which is crucial for cognition and memory are mediators of AD. Terminalia macroptera barks contain glycosyl terpenoids, known for their strong antioxidant properties. This study investigated the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of the glycosylic terpenoid-rich fraction of Terminalia macroptera (GT-TeMac™) in scopolamine-treated rats.
METHODS: Glycosylic terpenoids were identified by LC-MS and antiradical activity tests (DPPH and ORAC) were performed. Cholinergic cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress were induced in male wistar rats, by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg BW/day) for seven consecutive days. GT-TeMac™ at 100 mg/kg and Donepezil at 5 mg/kg body weight were administered orally 60 min after scopolamine. After treatment, rat were sacrificed and brains were collected for the evaluation of cholinergic enzyme activity, oxidative stress markers and histopathological analysis. In vitro study was carried out to assess the ability of GT-TeMac™ to scavenge free radicals and suppress H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced ROS production in SK-N-SH cells. In addition, the ability of GT-TeMac™ to restore cell viability reduced by acrolein was performed.
RESULTS: Chebuloside II, Sericoside, 24-deoxysericoside, arjunglucoside 1 and 23-galloylarjunolic acid 28-O-glucopyranosylester were identified by LC-MS. GT-TeMac™ has a SC<sub>50</sub> of 9.54 μg/mL and an ORAC value of 1130 µM Trolox equivalent per mg of GT-TeMac™. The administration of GT-TeMac™ protected against cognitive decline in AD by inhibiting cholinesterase metabolism, modulating oxidative stress parameters and protecting hippocampal areas. Additionally, GT-TeMac™ absorbed and eliminated ROS produced by hydrogen peroxide in SKNSH cells and restored cell viability reduced by acrolein.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the active ingredients in GT-TeMac™ are promising drug candidates for the treatment of cognitive disorders associated with oxidative stress in AD.",Biomed Pharmacother
40022984,Exploring the neurodegenerative potential of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances through an adverse outcome pathway network.,"While emerging evidence links per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to neurotoxicity, their potential role in neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Moreover, existing neurodegeneration-related adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) available on AOP-Wiki have not yet been integrated into a unified network. To address these gaps, this study aims to develop the first neurodegeneration-related AOP network and utilize it to explore the possible contributions of long-chain legacy PFAS to neurodegeneration, specifically concerning Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A total of 74 AOPs were screened from AOP-Wiki, of which 13 neurodegeneration-related AOPs met the eligibility criteria and were incorporated into a network. We analyzed the resulting AOP network using topological parameters such as in-degree, out-degree, eccentricity, and betweenness centrality. To elucidate the mechanistic contributions of PFAS exposure to neurodegenerative pathways, we integrated evidence linking PFAS exposure to key events (KEs) within the network. The results highlighted increased intracellular calcium as the network hub with the highest connectivity followed by critical KEs such as neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) overactivation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Consistent with toxicological evidence, the pathways highlighted by the AOP network indicate that PFAS may adversely affect neurotransmitter systems, particularly through NMDA-R overactivation, leading to excitotoxicity. This may result in calcium dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory-oxidative cascades, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death. By providing a mechanistic basis for understanding the neurodegenerative potential of PFAS, this study offers a crucial framework for assessing the risks associated with these chemicals which may inform future regulatory measures and public health strategies. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm the mechanistic contributions of PFAS exposure in neurodegeneration, particularly in animal models or human populations.",Sci Total Environ

We included 159 individuals (92 with MCI and 67 healthy controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and extracted their demographics, CSF biomarkers, and DTI metrics. We compared the biomarkers (CSF biomarkers and DTI markers in 57 white matter tracts) between the two study groups using a general linear model, adjusting for age, sex, and handedness. CSF biomarker levels showed a statistically significant difference between the two study groups. Also, diffusion properties of left Cingulum and left Uncinate fasciculus in both groups were statistically different. Additionally, we explored possible associations between CSF and DTI markers in the MCI group. Our results indicated several statistically significant associations between DTI metrics and CSF biomarkers within specific white matter tracts. These findings underscore the complexity of imaging and molecular markers associated with MCI.",J Clin Neurosci

However, its direct role in AD pathogenesis remains unexplored. Methods: We utilized the Cre/LoxP system to diminish NF-α1/CPE expression, and employed AAV-mediated overexpression of NF-α1/CPE. Results: NF-α1/CPE expression was significantly down-regulated in advanced stages of AD and with age in 5xFAD mice. Reduced NF-α1/CPE levels in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice increased plaque burden, microglial cell count, disrupted synaptogenesis, and intensified cognitive impairments at 5 and 7 months. However, by 9 months, no further progression of detrimental effects was observed. Overexpression of NF-α1/CPE markedly decreased amyloid plaque accumulation, mitigated spatial memory deficits, and normalized hippocampal synaptogenesis and microglial anomalies across early and late stages of the disease. Conclusion: NF-α1/CPE is a critical regulator of AD pathogenesis, offering promising therapeutic potential for reducing amyloid beta deposition and toxicity in AD.",Theranostics
40095208,Intranasal Delivery of Lithium Salt Suppresses Inflammatory Pyroptosis in the Brain and Ameliorates Memory Loss and Depression-like Behavior in 5XFAD Mice.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease (AD) and has no treatment that can cure or halt the disease progression. This study explored the therapeutic potential of lithium salt dissolved in Ryanodex formulation vehicle (RFV) and delivered to the brain by intranasal application. We first compared lithium concentrations in the brain and blood of wild-type mice following intranasal or oral administration of lithium chloride (LiCl) dissolved in either RFV or water. The beneficial and side effects of intranasal versus oral LiCl in RFV in these mice were assessed and potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of anti-inflammation and anti-pyroptosis in the brains were also investigated in both wild-type and 5XFAD Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mice brains.
METHODS: For the study of brain versus blood lithium concentrations, wild-type (WT) B6SJLF1/J mice at 2 months of age were treated with intranasal or oral LiCl (3 mmol/kg) dissolved in RFV or in water. Brain and blood lithium concentrations were measured at various times after drugs administration. Brain/blood lithium concentration ratios were then determined. For studying therapeutic efficacy versus side effects and their underlying mechanisms, 5XFAD and WT B6SJLF1/J mice were treated with intranasal LiCl (3 mmol/kg) daily, Monday to Friday each week, in RFV beginning at 2 or 9 months of age with a 12-week treatment duration. Animal behaviors were assessed for depression (tail suspension), cognition (fear conditioning and Y maze), olfaction (buried food test), and motor functions (rotarod) at the age of 5 and 12 months. Blood and brain tissue were harvested from these mice at 13 months. Blood biomarkers for the functions of thyroid (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) and kidney (creatinine) were measured using ELISA. Changes in protein expression levels of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels type 1 InsP<sub>3</sub> receptors (InsP<sub>3</sub>R-1), malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified proteins and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), pyroptosis regulatory proteins (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal of Gasdermin D (GSDMD)), cytotoxic (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α) and cytoprotective (IL-10) cytokines and synapse proteins (PSD-95, synapsin-1) were determined using immunoblotting. Mouse body weights were monitored regularly.
RESULTS: Compared to oral LiCl in RFV nanoparticles, intranasal treatment of WT mice with LiCl in RFV markedly decreased blood concentrations at the time range of 30-120 min. The ratio of brain/blood lithium concentration after intranasal lithium chloride in RFV significantly increased, in comparison to those after oral administration lithium chloride in RFV or intranasal administration of lithium chloride in water. Intranasal lithium chloride in RFV inhibited both memory loss and depressive behavior in adult and aged 5XFAD mice. Additionally intranasal treatment of aged 5XFAD mice with LiCl in RFV effectively suppressed the increases in InsP<sub>3</sub>R-1, intracellular oxidative stress markers (4-HNE-bound and MDA-modified proteins), pyroptosis activation proteins (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal GSDMD) and cytotoxic cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), but reversed the down-regulation of cytoprotective cytokine IL-10. Intranasal LiCl in RFV also alleviated the loss of the postsynaptic synapse proteins PSD-95, but not synapsin-1, in aged 5XFAD mice. Blood level of the kidney function marker creatinine was significantly increased in 5XFAD than in WT mice in an age-dependent manner and this elevation was abolished by intranasal delivery of LiCl in RFV. Intranasal LiCl in RFV for 12 weeks in both WT or 5XFAD mice did not affect blood biomarkers for thyroid function, nor did it affect smell or muscle function or body weight.
CONCLUSION: Intranasal administration of LiCl in RFV significantly decreased lithium blood concentrations and increased brain/blood lithium concentration ratio, in comparison to its oral administration. Intranasal administration of LiCl in RFV robustly protected against both memory loss and depressive-like behavior, while had no side effects concerning thyroid and kidney toxicity in 5XFAD mice. These lithium-induced beneficial effects were strongly associated with lithium's suppression of InsP<sub>3</sub>R-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel receptor increase, pathological neuroinflammation and activation of the pyroptosis pathway, as well as the loss of the synaptic protein PSD-95. Intranasal delivery of lithium salt in RFV could become an effective and potent inhibitor of pathological inflammation/pyroptosis in the CNS and serve as a new treatment for both AD-associated dementia and depression with minimal unwanted side effects including peripheral organ toxicity.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol
40040240,Adapting the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised with Semantic Cues: Assessing diagnostic utility in a Spanish clinical population.,"Background: The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) is widely used for assessing episodic memory. In this study, we evaluated the HVLT-R with Semantic Cues (HVLT-R-SC), an adapted version incorporating semantic cues to improve diagnostic utility. The assessment was conducted in a Spanish cohort comprising cognitively unimpaired controls, individuals with multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (md-aMCI), and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: 684 participants (333 controls, 141 md-aMCI, and 210 early AD) completed the HVLT-R-SC. Effect sizes were calculated to quantify group differences, while Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the test's reliability. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess discriminatory power, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizing classification accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, and efficacy percentages were reported, with optimized cutoff points determined. Odds ratios quantified the association between HVLT-R-SC performance and diagnostic group classifications. Results: Significant differences were observed across all HVLT-R-SC indices among the groups. Total Delayed Recall with and without Semantic Cues exhibited the largest effect size (η<sup>2</sup> = 0.69), with Total Delayed Recall with Semantic Cues demonstrating the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.90 for differentiating md-aMCI from controls and 0.99 for distinguishing early AD from controls). Optimal cutoffs for Total Delayed Recall with Semantic Cues were 5 words for md-aMCI (sensitivity = 74%, specificity = 90%, efficacy = 85.44%) and 4 words for early AD (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 97%, efficacy = 95.21%). Significant associations were observed between HVLT-R-SC performance and diagnostic classification, with an odds ratio of 26.04 for md-aMCI and 362.50 for early AD. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95), indicating strong reliability of the HVLT-R-SC. Conclusions: The HVLT-R-SC demonstrated strong reliability and excellent diagnostic performance in identifying memory impairments. The inclusion of semantic cues improved diagnostic accuracy, provided clinically actionable cutoff points, and enhanced the test's utility, particularly for detecting md-aMCI and early AD.",Clin Neuropsychol
40041300,Thalamic nuclei segmentation from T1-weighted MRI: Unifying and benchmarking state-of-the-art methods.,"The thalamus and its constituent nuclei are critical for a broad range of cognitive, linguistic, and sensorimotor processes, and are implicated in many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. However, the functional involvement and specificity of thalamic nuclei in human neuroimaging work is underappreciated and not well studied due, in part, to technical challenges of accurately identifying and segmenting nuclei. This challenge is further exacerbated by a lack of common nomenclature for comparing segmentation methods. Here, we use data from healthy young (Human Connectome Project, n = 100) and older healthy adults, plus those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, n = 540), to benchmark four state-of-the-art thalamic segmentation methods for T1 MRI (FreeSurfer, histogram-based polynomial synthesis [HIPS]-THOMAS, synthesized contrast segmentation [SCS]-convolutional neural network [CNN], and T1-THOMAS) under a single segmentation framework. Segmentations were compared using overlap and dissimilarity metrics to the Morel stereotaxic atlas, a widely accepted thalamic atlas. We also quantified each method's estimation of thalamic nuclear degeneration across Alzheimer's disease progression, and how accurately early and late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease could be distinguished from healthy controls. We show that the HIPS-THOMAS approach produced the most effective segmentations of individual thalamic nuclei relative to the Morel atlas, and was also most accurate in discriminating healthy controls from those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using individual nucleus volumes. This latter result was different when using whole thalamus volumes, where the SCS-CNN approach was the most accurate in classifying healthy controls. This work is the first to systematically compare the efficacy of anatomical thalamic segmentation approaches under a unified nomenclature. We also provide recommendations of which segmentation method to use for studying the functional relevance of specific thalamic nuclei, based on their overlap and dissimilarity with the Morel atlas.",Imaging Neurosci (Camb)
40081986,Development and evaluation of a healthcare decision-making intervention for African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads: a mixed-methods study protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a higher proportion of African American care partners due to African American older adults having more than twice the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared with non-Hispanic white older adults in the USA. African American adult daughters are the largest group of care partners of African American persons living with ADRD. Within this role, they are faced with navigating multiple health-related decisions to optimise the quality of life of their parent with ADRD, which can negatively influence their own quality of life. This study is guided by three conceptual frameworks: National Institute on Aging's Health Disparities Research Framework, Black Family Socio-Ecological Context Model and Superwoman Schema. The purpose of this study was to develop a structured culturally responsive prototype intervention that will improve the healthcare decision-making self-efficacy and quality of life of African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads. The prototype intervention will be piloted in a single-group clinical trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be conducted in two phases using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, wherein qualitative data collection follows quantitative data collection to explain the findings. In the first phase, the quantitative data collection will examine the behavioural, sociocultural and environmental lifecourse influences on healthcare decision-making self-efficacy and the quality of life of 70 African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads (ie, persons living with ADRD and their adult daughter care partners). The qualitative data collection will consist of a nested sample of 15 dementia dyads and focus on the decision-making processes that affect current and future healthcare use for the parents living with ADRD. Further, this study will explore how these processes influence the quality of life of both members. In phase 2, integrated findings from phase 1 will provide the basis for the development of the prototype intervention using design thinking and intervention mapping with key informants and community advisory board oversight. Once the prototype intervention is developed, a clinical trial will be conducted. This trial will enrol a new sample of 20 African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads using a pretest-post-test design.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The first phase of the study has been approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05139290). This study will contribute to the development of a structured culturally responsive prototype intervention for African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads. The findings will determine whether a larger randomised controlled trial is warranted. Results of the research will be disseminated in both academic and community settings.

40034360,Blood RNA transcripts show changes in inflammation and lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial function in mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal immunity in the periphery has been reported in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, blood transcriptome analyses of patients with AD, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and heathy controls were performed to elucidate immune-related pathophysiology.
METHODS: The sample included 63 participants from a complete enumeration study of elderly people in Nakayama town (the Nakayama Study), who were over 65 years of age, diagnosed as (1) healthy controls (N = 21, mean age: 83.8 years), (2) having MCI due to AD (N = 20, mean age: 82.6 years), or (3) having AD (N = 21, mean age: 84.2 years). Every participant underwent blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and questionnaires about lifestyle and cognitive function. With transcriptome analysis, differential gene expressions in the blood of the three groups were evaluated by gene ontology, pathway enrichment, and ingenuity pathway analyses, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed.
RESULTS: Neutrophil extracellular trap signaling was increased, and lipid metabolism (FXR/RXR activation, triacylglycerol degradation) was decreased in AD, whereas MCI showed protective responses via decreased neutrophil extracellular trap signaling and mitochondrial functions such as upregulation of the sirtuin pathway and downregulation of oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings and consistent with other published studies, immune cells appear to have important roles in the pathogenesis of AD, and the transcriptome in blood may be useful as a biomarker for diagnosis via monitoring immunity in MCI and AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40156913,Multi-omic analysis of meningeal cerebral amyloid angiopathy reveals enrichment of unsubstituted glucosamine and extracellular proteins.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease in which amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in cerebral and leptomeningeal vessel walls, predisposing vessels to micro- and macro-hemorrhages. The vessel walls contain distinct proteins and heparan sulfate (HS), yet how vascular proteins and HS jointly associate with Aβ is unknown. We conducted the first multi-omics study to systematically characterize the proteins as well as the HS abundance, sulfation level, and disaccharide composition of leptomeninges from 23 moderate to severe CAA cases and controls. We then analyzed the associations between Aβ and other proteins, HS, and apolipoprotein E genotype. We found an increase in a minor HS disaccharide containing unsubstituted glucosamine, as well as 6-O sulfated disaccharides; Aβ40 levels positively correlated with unsubstituted glucosamine. There was also an increase in extracellular proteins derived from brain parenchyma or plasma, including olfactomedin-like protein 3, fibrinogen, serum amyloid protein, apolipoprotein E, and secreted frizzled related protein-3. Our findings of vascular HS and protein alterations specific to CAA-affected leptomeningeal vessels provide molecular insight into the extracellular remodeling that co-occurs with Aβ deposits and may indicate a basis for antemortem diagnostic assay development and therapeutic strategies to impede Aβ-HS interactions.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol
40120689,Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mediated mRNA delivery in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and the impairment of cellular functions. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a promising therapy for treating NDD, as it can encode missing or dysfunctional proteins and anti-inflammatory cytokines or neuroprotective proteins to halt the progression of these diseases. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a significant challenge due to the limited penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer an efficient solution by encapsulating and protecting mRNA, facilitating transfection and intracellular delivery. This review discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury, and Friedreich's ataxia. Additionally, it explores the potential of LNP-mediated mRNA delivery as a therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Various approaches to overcoming BBB-related challenges and enhancing the delivery and efficacy of mRNA-LNPs are discussed, including non-invasive methods with strong potential for clinical translation. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-guided mRNA and LNP design, targeted delivery, gene editing, and CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA-LNPs could significantly transform the treatment landscape for NDD, paving the way for future clinical applications.",J Control Release
40078451,The Correlation Between RIN3 Gene Methylation and Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer's disease. Many individuals with PD experience cognitive impairment, significantly threatening both their physical and mental well-being. Research has shown that abnormal DNA methylation is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The RIN3 gene, which encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, plays a role in inhibiting amyloid-beta formation and affects protein endocytosis, both of which are linked to cognitive impairment. However, the potential connection between RIN3 gene methylation and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease has not yet been explored. This study aims to explore whether the methylation status of the RIN3 gene is connected to cognitive decline in Parkinson's patients, thereby shedding light on the gene's crucial role in the disease's development and identifying potential targets for diagnosing and treating cognitive impairment in this context.
PURPOSE: This study aims to explore whether the methylation status of the RIN3 gene is associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and to further clarify the gene's significant role in the disease's pathogenesis.
METHODS: This study involved 50 control subjects and 51 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, who were assessed using a cognitive scale. Additionally, DNA methylation in whole blood was analyzed. The research compared RIN3 methylation levels between the PD group and the normal control group (NC), as well as between the subgroups of PD-Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI), PD-Normal Cognition (PD-NC), and the control group.
RESULTS: The DNA methylation level of the RIN3 gene in the whole blood of patients with PD was lower than that in healthy controls (22.3%vs.23.6%, P=0.009). Moreover, individuals with PD-MCI had significantly lower RIN3 methylation levels than both the control group (21.3%vs.23.6%, P<0.001) and those in the PD-NC group (21.3%vs.23.3%, P=0.001).
CONCLUSION: RIN3 methylation is associated with PD-MCI. With appropriate lifestyle changes and clinical interventions, methylation may influence disease progression, suggesting that RIN3 gene methylation could serve as a predictor for the development of PD-MCI.",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat
40087396,Endothelial TDP-43 depletion disrupts core blood-brain barrier pathways in neurodegeneration.,"Endothelial cells (ECs) help maintain the blood-brain barrier but deteriorate in many neurodegenerative disorders. Here we show, using a specialized method to isolate EC and microglial nuclei from postmortem human cortex (92 donors, 50 male and 42 female, aged 20-98 years), that intranuclear cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes enables simultaneous profiling of nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts at a single-nucleus resolution. We identify a disease-associated subset of capillary ECs in Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. These capillaries exhibit reduced nuclear β-catenin and β-catenin-downstream genes, along with elevated TNF/NF-κB markers. Notably, these transcriptional changes correlate with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein also depleted in neuronal nuclei. TDP-43 disruption in human and mouse ECs replicates these alterations, suggesting that TDP-43 deficiency in ECs is an important factor contributing to blood-brain barrier breakdown in neurodegenerative diseases.",Nat Neurosci
40118731,Sample size estimates for biomarker-based outcome measures in clinical trials in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD)-modifying therapies are approved for treatment of early-symptomatic AD. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a unique opportunity to test therapies in presymptomatic individuals.
METHODS: Using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), sample sizes for clinical trials were estimated for various cognitive, imaging, and CSF outcomes. Sample sizes were computed for detecting a reduction of either absolute levels of AD-related pathology (amyloid, tau) or change over time in neurodegeneration (atrophy, hypometabolism, cognitive change).
RESULTS: Biomarkers measuring amyloid and tau pathology had required sample sizes below 200 participants per arm (examples CSF Aβ42/40: 47[95 %CI 25,104], cortical PIB 49[28,99], CSF p-tau181 74[48,125]) for a four-year trial in presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0) to have 80 % power (5 % statistical significance) to detect a 25 % reduction in absolute levels of pathology, allowing 40 % dropout. For cognitive, MRI, and FDG, it was more appropriate to detect a 50 % reduction in rate of change. Sample sizes ranged from 250 to 900 (examples hippocampal volume: 338[131,2096], cognitive composite: 326[157,1074]). MRI, FDG and cognitive outcomes had lower sample sizes when including indivduals with mild impairment (CDR=0.5 and 1) as well as presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0).
DISCUSSION: Despite the rarity of ADAD, presymptomatic clinical trials with feasible sample sizes given the number of cases appear possible.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40114424,Associations between the logical memory test story recall metrics and plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in individuals free of dementia.,"Objective: Blood-based biomarkers are valued for their lower cost and less invasive nature, though issues with widespread implementation and accessibility remain. Process-based scores from story recall have been shown to detect neuronal network disturbances typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology more effectively than traditional metrics. This study examined the associations between process-based scores and concurrent plasma AD biomarkers in older adults without dementia, while also comparing them to traditional metrics. Additionally, it also investigated the diagnostic utility of these metrics in detecting plasma p-tau217 positivity. Methods: Data from 416 participants (mean age = 66.6 ± 7) free of dementia were extracted from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Logical Memory Test (LMT) and plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau231, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, GFAP and NfL levels were analyzed. Bayesian regression models assessed associations between plasma biomarkers and both process-based and traditional LMT scores, controlling for the covariates. Results: The best-fitting model for plasma p-tau217 included Total ratio (Tr) and Immediate recall (BF10=573), but Tr showed stronger evidence of association (mean coefficient = 0.208; BFinclusion=14.4) than Immediate recall (mean coefficient=-0.007; BFinclusion=1.7). Tr was also the best predictor of plasma p-tau181 (mean coefficient = 0.144; BF10=10.5) and GFAP (mean coefficient = 0.141; BF10=5.8), outperforming traditional LMT scores. No memory scores were associated with plasma p-tau231 or Aβ42/40 ratio levels. Tr score was the strongest single predictor of p-tau217 positivity (BF<sub>10</sub>=38). Conclusions: These findings suggest that process-based memory scores might be useful in enhancing the detection of neuronal network disturbances associated with AD pathology, especially in settings where biomarker testing is unavailable.",Clin Neuropsychol
40080233,The Potential of cfDNA as Biomarker: Opportunities and Challenges for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the progressive and gradual degeneration of neurons. The prevalence and rates of these disorders rise significantly with age. As life spans continue to increase in many countries, the number of cases is expected to grow in the foreseeable future. Early and precise diagnosis, along with appropriate surveillance, continues to pose a challenge. The high heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases calls for more accurate and definitive biomarkers to improve clinical therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), including fragmented DNA released into bodily fluids via apoptosis, necrosis, or active secretion, has emerged as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for various disorders including neurodegenerative diseases. cfDNA can serve as an indicator of ongoing cellular damage and mortality, including neuronal loss, and may provide valuable insights into disease processes, progression, and therapeutic responses. This review will first cover the key aspects of cfDNA and then examine recent advances in its potential use as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders.",J Mol Neurosci
39986219,Neddylation inhibition affects cell proliferation and steroidogenesis in sheep follicular granulosa cells.,"Neddylation is a biological process that covalently links neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to its substrate. Its main function is to activate the cullin ubiquitin junction complex, thereby promoting substrate protein degradation. The research of neddylation mainly focus on cell senescence, Alzheimer's disease progression, and tumor treatment. However, the neddylation mechanism underlying follicular granulosa cells (GCs) proliferation and steroidogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to reveal the functions of neddylation in sheep follicular GCs. Here, immunohistochemistry results revealed that NEDD8 was expressed in sheep follicular GCs. The neddylation-specific inhibitor MLN4924 and NEDD8 small interfering (si) RNA (si-NEDD8) were used to inhibit neddylation, significantly attenuating sheep follicular GC proliferation. The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) showed that cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) and steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) were significantly downregulated via the inhibition of neddylation. Additionally, qRT-PCR results showed that CYP11A1, StAR and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) mRNA abundance decreased significantly following the addition of various MLN4924 doses and si-NEDD8, however, CYP19A1 mRNA levels did not significantly differ. Western blotting results showed that inhibition of neddylation also significantly decreased the expression of CYP11A1, 3β-HSD, cytochrome P450 19A1 (CYP19A1), StAR, and androgen receptor (AR). The current study revealed that the inhibition of neddylation affects sheep follicular GC function by inhibiting proliferation and the enzymes involved in synthesis in sheep.",Theriogenology
40051009,TREM2 risk variants and associated endophenotypes in alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Rare variants of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) gene are strong risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and drugs targeting the TREM2 protein are being developed. However, it is unknown what the effect of TREM2 variants is on the AD phenotype.
METHODS: Here we studied a full range of clinical and biomarker measures in a large cohort of TREM2 variant carriers (n = 123, 7.8%, i.e., R62H n = 66, R47H n = 26, T96K n = 16, other TREM2 variants n = 17) compared to confirmed non-carriers (n = 1,459) with biomarker confirmed symptomatic AD from Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Secondly, we explored whether specific TREM2 variants were associated with distinct clinical measures compared to the reference group, i.e. non-carriers, within the same cohort.
RESULTS: TREM2 variant carriers (64 ± 7 years, 54% female) did not show distinct clinical measures of AD at presentation compared to AD patients not carrying a TREM2 variant (64 ± 7 years, 52% female). We observed no differences in MMSE, neuropsychological domains (except less impaired visuospatial functioning in TREM2 carriers), MRI scores, CSF biomarkers, EEG, structural MRI (41 ROIs) and Tau-PET scans of four carriers (R62H, R47H, G58A, D87N). Carriers did show faster cognitive decline (MMSE points per year 0.6 ± 0.3, P <sub>fdr</sub> = 0.099) compared to non-carriers. Notably, both R47H and T96K carriers exhibited faster cognitive decline (P &lt; 0.05), and R47H carriers even showed an increased rate of death after diagnosis (P = 0.034). In contrast to the shared cognitive decline, these variants showed different results for other measures at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that while carriers of TREM2 risk variants cannot be distinguished based on clinical presentation at baseline compared to non-carriers, they do exhibit a faster global cognitive decline. Variant-specific analyses indicate that especially R47H and T96K carriers drive this association. These results highlight the importance of considering variant-specific effects for understanding the role of TREM2 biology in AD. The rich phenotype information can inform clinical stage drug development.",Alzheimers Res Ther
39995945,Microvascular dysfunction in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease using intravital microscopy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurocognitive disorder. Early theories of AD sought to identify a single unifying explanation underlying AD pathogenesis; however, evolving evidence suggests it is a multifactorial, systemic disease, involving multiple systems. Of note, vascular dysfunction, encompassing both cerebral and peripheral circulation, has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. This pilot study used intravital microscopy to assess differences in responsiveness of gluteal muscle arterioles between a transgenic AD mouse model (APP/PS1; Tg) and wild-type (C57BL/6; WT) mice to further elucidate the role of vascular dysfunction in AD. Arteriole diameters were measured in response to acetylcholine (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M), phenylephrine (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M), histamine (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> M) and compound 48/80 (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-3</sup> M). Tg mice demonstrated a trend toward reduced vasodilatory response to acetylcholine with a significant difference at 10<sup>-5</sup> M (36.91 vs. 69.55%: p = 0.0107) when compared to WT. No significant differences were observed with histamine, compound 48/80 or phenylephrine; however, a trend toward reduced vasoconstriction to phenylephrine was observed in Tg mice at higher concentrations. Mean net diameter change (resting to maximum) also differed significantly (p = 0.0365) between WT (19.11 μm) and Tg mice (11.13 μm). These findings suggest reduced vascular responsiveness may contribute to the systemic vascular deficits previously observed in AD models. Future research using diverse models and broader variables could further elucidate peripheral vascular dysfunction's role in AD pathogenesis, including its impact on motor symptoms and disease progression. Such insights may inform the development of vascular-targeted therapeutic strategies.",Front Aging Neurosci
40145464,Heterogeneous brain abnormalities in subjective cognitive decline converge on a common network and their transcriptional signature.,"INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is increasingly recognized as closely related to future Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous neuroimaging findings in SCD are inconsistent. We tested whether the various findings localize to a common brain network.
METHODS: Using a novel coordinate network mapping approach, we delineated common brain damage networks that were functionally connected to reported neuroimaging findings. We then decoded these common networks using microscale transcriptomic and chemo-architectures and psychological processes.
RESULTS: We enrolled 45 studies comprising 2453 SCD patients and 3017 healthy controls. The identified SCD networks were largely localized in the somatosensory network (SMN) and default mode network (DMN). Both were robust to perturbations of analyzed parameters and in an independent validation dataset. Neurobiology correlation analyses identified some key biological pathways and neurotransmitters linked to these networks.
DISCUSSION: Our findings reconcile heterogeneous neuroimaging abnormalities in SCD and provide a richer neurobiological underpinning, which has implications for understanding patients with SCD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The heterogeneous neuroimaging findings on SCD were reconciled in a coordinate network mapping framework. The SCD-related functional network involves changes in the DMN, while the SCD-related structural network has changes mainly in primary sensory areas. The identified genes in the functional network were predominantly enriched in biological processes related to synaptic structure, calcium ion binding, and cellular metabolism. An ALE meta-analysis was conducted for comparison.",Alzheimers Dement

40162582,Visual Monitoring of Biomolecular Self-Assembly Dynamics and Imaging of Protein Aggregates by Distinct Emission of a Unique Hydrophobic Carbon Dot.,"Here, we report a novel and unique application of a special hydrophobic carbon dot (HCD) to monitor biomolecular self-assembly, along with the detection of metastable intermediates and self-aggregates. We exploited the restricted rotation of the S-S bond of the HCD synthesized from dithiosalicylic acid and melamine to illuminate different emission behaviors during the self-assembly of amino acids and proteins. The HCD that exhibits blue emission in amino acid droplets or protein aggregates dynamically changes its emission from blue to red over the time course of the amino acid self-assembly process. This unique and distinct change in emission can be visualized by the naked eye under a UV lamp. The ability of HCD to distinguish the biomolecular self-aggregated structures and monitor the self-assembly dynamics can be utilized for the visual detection of uncontrolled aggregation of proteins and peptides related to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",J Phys Chem Lett
40116426,Activatable Photoacoustic Probe for Imaging Infection: Gold Nanorod Dissociation In Vivo Reports Bacterial Protease Activity.,"We present a strategy for constructing activatable photoacoustic imaging (PAI) probes for in vivo enzyme activity measurements, based on a dissociation strategy previously applied to in vitro sensing. Unlike conventional nanoparticle aggregation strategies, dissociation minimizes false positives and functions effectively in complex biological environments. Overcoming the challenge of dissociating nanostructure aggregates, which arises from the strong van der Waals forces at short distances, we demonstrate the controlled assembly and dissociation of citrate-capped gold nanorods (AuNRs-citrate) using a diarginine peptide additive and a thiolated polyethylene glycol (HS-PEG-OMe), respectively. This assembly dissociation mechanism enables precise control of the optical and photoacoustic (PA) properties of AuNRs in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Building on these findings, we engineered an enzyme-sensitive PAI probe (AuNRs@RgpB) composed of AuNR assemblies and a PEG-peptide conjugate with a protease-specific cleavage sequence. The probe detects Arg-specific gingipain (RgpB), a protease expressed by Porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease and Alzheimer's disease. Proteolytic cleavage of the peptide sequence triggers AuNR dissociation, resulting in enhanced PA signal output. The probe was designed to be injected intrathecally for preclinical trials to image gingipains and investigate the value of gingipain inhibitors developed for Alzheimer's disease. The probe's performance was characterized in vitro using UV-vis spectroscopy and PAI, achieving detection limits of 5 and 20 nM, respectively. In vivo studies involved intracranial injection of AuNRs@RgpB into RgpB-containing murine models, with PA monitoring over time. RgpB activity produced a four-fold PA signal increase within 2 h, while P. gingivalis-infected mice showed similar signal enhancement. Specificity was confirmed by negligible responses to Fusobacterium nucleatum, a non-RgpB-producing bacterium. Additionally, the system demonstrated utility in drug development by successfully monitoring the inhibition of RgpB activity using RgpB inhibitors (leupeptin and KYT-1) in vivo models. Beyond its immediate application to RgpB detection, this modular approach to plasmonic-based sensing holds significant potential for detecting other proteases, advancing both nanotechnology and protease-targeted diagnostics.",ACS Nano
40118328,Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders: Focus on antisense oligonucleotides.,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specifically bind to target RNA sequences and regulate protein expression through various mechanisms. ASOs are a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The ASO field is a growing area of drug development that focuses on targeting the root cause of diseases at the RNA level, providing a promising alternative to therapies that target downstream processes. Addressing challenges related to off-target effects and inadequate biological activity is essential to successfully develop ASO-based therapies. Researchers have investigated various chemical modifications and delivery strategies to overcome these challenges. This review discusses oligonucleotide-based therapies, particularly ASOs. We discuss the chemical modifications and mechanisms of action of ASOs. Additionally, we recap the results of preclinical and clinical studies testing different ASOs in various neurodegenerative disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, ASO drugs show promise as a therapeutic option for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",Eur J Pharmacol

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of long-term nonfatal exposure to Deltamethrin in spreading this disease. To this end, a range of aspects of brain damage were discussed in rats administered deltamethrin in oral doses of 0.65 mg/kg b.w. and 1.3 mg/kg b.w. for 30 days. The activation of beta-amyloid, the primary component of plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and the NG2, a type 1 transmembrane protein, was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot methods in rat brain. In addition, the expression level of the APP, GFAP, NfL, TNF-alpha, CXCL9, CCL5, and IL-1 alpha genes in deltamethrin-exposed brain tissue was measured using qRT-PCR. In addition, levels of pTau181 and Abeta42 were measured with ELISA. A strong positive immunohistochemical reaction for beta-amyloid was detected in the deltamethrin-exposed brain tissues. A decrease in NG2 immunofluorescence positivity was found in the application groups compared to the control group. It was demonstrated that deltamethrin exposure significantly up-regulated the expressions of APP, GFAP, NfL, TNF-alpha, CXCL9, CCL5, and IL-1 alpha genes, also significantly higher the levels of pTau181 and Abeta42 (pg/ml) in rat brain tissues. This study provides scientific evidence that exposure to chronic doses of deltamethrin may play a positive role in the development of diseases such as Alzheimer's. Future studies should investigate similar projects and expand knowledge on the topic.",Exp Neurol
39989286,"Associations of hippocampal volumes, brain hypometabolism, and plasma NfL with amyloid, tau, and cognitive decline.","INTRODUCTION: Various indicators of neurodegeneration (N) are used in the assessment of neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The heterogeneity of such indicators is less clear.
METHODS: A total of 416 individuals with different cognitive statuses were recruited for this study. Differential associations of hippocampal volume (HV), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs), and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels with amyloid beta (Aβ)-tau pathology and cognitive impairment were examined.
RESULTS: HV decreased early during the high Aβ burden but tau-negative stage. FDG PET SUVRs and plasma NfL levels notably changed at tau-positive stages. HV and plasma NfL correlated with cognitive scores in the early to middle stages, while FDG PET SUVRs aligned with cognitive decline from the middle to late stages. Hippocampal atrophy and inferior parietal hypometabolism increased the risk of cognitive impairment in A+T+, while adding NfL+ had no additional impact within the distinct A/T groups.
DISCUSSION: Different indicators of N have varying relationships to AD pathology and cognitive impairment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hippocampal atrophy emerges early with a high amyloid beta burden and exacerbates during the tau-positive phase. Brain hypometabolism and elevated plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels appear mainly in tau-positive stages. Hippocampal volume and plasma NfL levels correlate with cognitive decline in the early to middle stages, while 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography standardized uptake value ratios in the middle to late stages. Hippocampal atrophy and inferior parietal hypometabolism raise the risk of cognitive impairment in amyloid/tau-positive individuals while adding NfL+ shows no additional effect.",Alzheimers Dement
40132562,"Alzheimer's disease, β-amyloid peptides and ubiquitin-proteasome system: nutritherapeutic insights.","BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's disease - an age-related neurodegenerative disorder leading to a progressive cognitive impairment - is characterized by an intracerebral accumulation of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, followed by the appearance of abnormally ubiquitinylated neurofibrillary tangles - a process associated with a chronic inflammation. The systematic presence of ubiquitinylated inclusions reflects a decrease in the proteasome activity due to (and contributing to) the presence of Aβ oligomers - a central dysfunction in the etiology of the disease.
SUMMARY: The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system opens new therapeutic perspectives for both prevention and treatment. In particular, the potential for synergistic strategies combining diet-derived proteasome activators, immunoproteasome inhibitors and modulators of β-amyloid peptide aggregation to prevent delay or even reverse the disease progression over time is currently arousing growing interest.
KEY MESSAGES: In that perspective, and in the light of the recent advances in the understanding of the key molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, the present review highlights the mechanisms of action and the preventive and therapeutic potential of some diet-derived bioactive compounds and other natural substances of interest.

40154861,Amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways of amyloid precursor protein processing in oligodendrocytes.,"Excessive accumulation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) species in the brain is a major pathological process triggering neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies indicate that both neurons and glial cells, including oligodendrocyte lineages (OLs), contribute to brain homeostasis and affect AD pathology; however, the roles of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in AD remain to be fully elucidated. This study examined Aβ production and related protein expression in primary cultured OLs. Primary cultured OLs produced Aβ40 and Aβ42 and expressed amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase (PS1) as well as α-secretase (ADAM10). OLGs express APP770 in addition to APP695. Treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor reduced Aβ40 and Aβ42 production levels derived from OPCs/OLGs and suppressed OPC differentiation. Additionally, conditioned media from OLGs improved neuronal cell viability under oxidative stress and contained higher levels of sAPPα compared to OPCs. The neuroprotective effect of OLG was diminished by a sAPPα inhibitor, suggesting that OLG-derived sAPPα protects neurons under oxidative stress. These findings revealed that OLs produce pathogenic Aβ40/42 via the amyloidogenic pathway and secrete neuroprotective sAPPα via the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Elucidating the pathological shift from beneficial non-amyloidogenic to harmful amyloidogenic processes in OLs during AD onset and progression would provide crucial insights into novel therapeutic approaches.",Brain Res
40095620,Effect of TNF-α blockers on reducing the risk of dementia in rheumatoid arthritis: a nationwide cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share characteristics of chronic inflammation and immune system dysregulation. RA patients are known to have an increased risk of dementia, yet studies on the association between tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α blocker use and dementia risk in RA patients are lacking. This population-based cohort study aimed to investigate whether TNF-α blocker use is associated with a reduced risk of dementia in RA patients.
METHODS: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified RA patients treated with TNF-α blockers (etanercept, adalimumab and golimumab) and matched them 1:4 with RA patients receiving conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). A stratified Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare dementia risk between these groups.
RESULTS: Among 3.987 RA patients using TNF-α blockers and 20,689 RA patients not using TNF-α blockers (comparison group), no significant difference in dementia risk was initially observed. However, upon further analysis stratified by TNF-α blocker exposure, RA patients with long-term (>180 cumulative defined daily dose [cDDD]) TNF-α blocker use had a significantly lower risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=0.578, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.342-0.977), after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Moreover, higher cumulative doses (>1036 cDDD) of TNF-α blockers were associated with a further reduced risk of dementia (aHR=0.387, 95% CI=0.188-0.793).
CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cohort study suggests that long-term and higher cumulative doses of TNF-α blockers may be associated with a lower risk of dementia in patients with RA.",Clin Exp Rheumatol

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective potential of GA on learning and memory in a rat model of scopolamine-induced cholinergic dysfunction. Additionally, the roles of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation were examined. Rats were divided into six groups: Control, scopolamine (2 mg/kg/day), scopolamine plus 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of GA, and scopolamine plus 2 mg/kg of donepezil (DN, administered once daily). Behavioral performance was evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Passive Avoidance Test. Biochemical parameters were assessed to determine oxidative stress, and gene expression analyses were conducted to explore neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. The behavioral tests revealed that both GA and DN treatments improved the rats' performance in the MWM, as evidenced by their ability to locate the platform and spend more time in the target area. Additionally, GA administration increased the latency of entering the dark compartment and extended the time spent in the light compartment while reducing the frequency of dark compartment entries in the Passive Avoidance Test. Furthermore, GA exhibited antioxidant, anti-acetylcholinesterase, and anti-inflammatory effects, as indicated by the modulation of malondialdehyde levels, thiol content, superoxide dismutase activity, acetylcholinesterase activity, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the potential therapeutic benefits of GA in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its ability to enhance memory function and mitigate oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase activity, and inflammation.",Inflammopharmacology

However, the specific roles of different cathepsins in AD remain unclear.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the genetic associations and potential causal relationships between cathepsins and AD, using Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore their roles as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.MethodsA two-sample MR analysis was conducted using genome-wide association study data for AD and cathepsins. Genetic variants associated with cathepsin expression were used as instrumental variables. Forward MR assessed the causal effect of cathepsins on AD, while reverse MR explored the impact of AD on cathepsin levels. Colocalization analysis was performed to identify shared genetic variants between cathepsins and AD.ResultsCathepsin H was significantly associated with an increased risk of AD (p = 0.0034, OR = 1.04), with consistent results across multiple MR methods.

39980634,Blood-based biomarkers in mild behavioral impairment: an updated overview.,"Identifying individuals at-risk for dementia is one of the critical objectives of current research efforts, highlighting the need for simple, cost-effective, and minimally invasive biomarkers. Mild behavioral impairment (MBI), characterized by the emergence of persistent neuropsychiatric manifestations in older adults, has attracted increasing attention as a potential early indicator of cognitive decline and dementia. A growing number of studies have recently begun to explore the relationship between MBI and several blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, neurodegeneration, as well as systemic metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation. In this context, MBI has been associated with lower plasma Aβ42/Αβ40 ratio, higher plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), increased neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, as well as disturbances in metabolic markers, including homocysteine, insulin and ferritin, suggesting a multifaceted neurobiological basis for this syndrome. These findings offer insights into the underlying pathophysiology of MBI, and connection between neuropsychiatric symptoms and progression of AD. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and critically discuss the emerging literature evidence linking MBI to blood-based biomarkers, hoping to shed more light on MBI's pathophysiology, its connection to AD-related neurobiology, as well as its potential practical utility for predicting cognitive impairment, guiding early interventions and managing the risk for dementia.",Front Neurol
40117973,Delving into the crucial role of the initial structure in the dynamic and self-assembly of amyloid beta.,"Alzheimer's disease involves the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) monomers that form oligomers and fibrils in the brain. Studying the Aβ monomer is critical for understanding Aβ assembly and peptide behavior and has implications for drug design. Choosing a starting structure with a higher aggregation tendency for cost-effective MD studies and drug design is crucial. Previous studies have utilized distinct initial conformations, leading to varying results. Hence, this study was conducted to compare different initial conformations using the same MD simulation protocol to investigate the behavior and oligomerization propensity of different starting structures of Aβ during 1μs. The behavior of the monomers and their self-assembly systems were studied thoroughly, and the results revealed that highly helical Aβ monomers which used as starting structures retain high helix content during the simulation, and their tautomerization states did not cause significant changes in the structure. On the other hand, the Aβ extended and S-shaped monomers displayed the fingerprints of the fibril structure, which is believed to be more favorable for self-assembly. Self-assembly behaviors were seen for three S-shaped and three Aβ extended peptides. However, both conformations did not show stable β-sheet intermolecular interaction. For the Aβ16-22 monomer as a fragment of the Aβ that can assemble into fibrils, the impacts of capping and uncapping on the initial structure were also investigated. The results displayed that capped and uncapped structures can form oligomers with β-sheet at termini. However, in the capped state, β-sheet interactions were more stable and remained relatively longer than uncapped.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun
40076979,Differential Transcriptional Programs Reveal Modular Network Rearrangements Associated with Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, genetically heterogeneous disorder. The diverse phenotypes associated with AD result from interactions between genetic and environmental factors, influencing multiple biological pathways throughout disease progression. Network-based approaches offer a way to assess phenotype-specific states. In this study, we calculated key network metrics to characterize the network transcriptional structure and organization in LOAD, focusing on genes and pathways implicated in AD pathology within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Our findings revealed disease-specific coexpression markers associated with diverse metabolic functions. Additionally, significant differences were observed at both the mesoscopic and local levels between AD and control networks, along with a restructuring of gene coexpression and biological functions into distinct transcriptional modules. These results show the molecular reorganization of the transcriptional program occurring in LOAD, highlighting specific adaptations that may contribute to or result from cellular responses to pathological stressors. Our findings may support the development of a unified model for the causal mechanisms of AD, suggesting that its diverse manifestations arise from multiple pathways working together to produce the disease's complex clinical patho-phenotype.",Int J Mol Sci
40003952,L-Lactate Administration Improved Synaptic Plasticity and Cognition in Early 3xTg-AD Mice.,"Synaptic plasticity impairment and behavioral deficits constitute classical pathological hallmarks in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests these synaptic dysfunctions may stem from metabolic dysregulation, particularly impaired aerobic glycolysis. As a key product of astrocyte-mediated aerobic glycolysis, lactate serves dual roles as both an energy substrate and a signaling molecule, playing a critical regulatory role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. This study investigated whether exogenous L-lactate supplementation could ameliorate synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in early-stage AD models. Our findings reveal significant reductions in hippocampal lactate levels in experimental AD mice. Systemic administration of L-lactate (200 mg/kg) effectively restored physiological lactate concentrations in both hippocampal tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Chronic L-lactate treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory performance in behavioral assessments. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that either acute bath application of L-lactate (2 mM) to hippocampal slices or chronic intraperitoneal administration enhanced high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude in 3xTg-AD mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that L-lactate treatment enhanced synaptic density and improved morphological features of hippocampal synapses. At the molecular level, L-lactate administration upregulated synaptic marker synaptophysin (SYP) expression while downregulating activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (ARC) levels in AD mice. These multimodal findings demonstrate that exogenous L-lactate supplementation effectively restores synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in early-stage 3xTg-AD mice through concurrent improvements at behavioral, structural, and molecular levels.",Int J Mol Sci

39989313,Evaluation of the Ability of Wasp Venom Bioinspired Peptides (Fraternine-10 and Octovespin) in the Disaggregation and Anti-Aggregation of Amyloid-β Fibrils.,"Many neurodegenerative diseases are directly related to the formation of toxic protein aggregates, such as Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ). In this context, protein fibrils are the hallmark of these neurodegenerative diseases. In this sense, developing compounds capable of preventing or reducing the formation of protein aggregation in the brain can be of fundamental importance for the curative treatment of these diseases. Animals' venom compounds are known to be selected for nervous system targets, therefore, they are considered an interesting platform for developing pharmacological tools. This work presents a study of the ligands Octovespin (bioinspired by the wasp venom Polybia occidentalis) and Fraternine-10 (bioinspired by the wasp venom Parachartergus fraternus) concerning the disaggregation and anti-aggregation of fibrils of Aβ(17-42) sheets. First, we performed in silico calculations using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations with 200 ns. The results indicate that Octovespin and Fraternine-10 interact with the Aβ protein fibrils throughout all simulation time. The RMSD, RMSF, number of hydrogen and radius of gyration values and the interactions with amino acids responsible for fibril aggregation demonstrate that both Octovespin and Fraternine-10 have a significant disaggregation potential, which corroborates the in vitro and in vivo experimental observations. Furthermore, experimental data of Fraternine-10 demonstrated an anti-aggregation effect, indicating that it can promote fibril disaggregation and prevent them from aggregating again to form oligomers. However, in vivo data of Fraternine-10 did not show improvement. Even though in vivo results were not promising, the in vitro and in silico discoveries qualify these molecules as potential sources for developing new candidates to become medicines against Alzheimer's disease.",Proteins

In chemical reaction network modeling, this synergy proves valuable, addressing the high computational costs of detailed mechanistic models while leveraging the predictive power of machine learning. This study applies this fusion to the biomedical challenge of Aβ fibril aggregation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease. Central to the research is the introduction of an automatic reaction order model reduction framework, designed to optimize reduced-order kinetic models. This framework represents a shift in model construction, automatically determining the appropriate level of detail for reaction network modeling. The proposed approach significantly improves simulation efficiency and accuracy, particularly in systems like Aβ aggregation, where precise modeling of nucleation and growth kinetics can reveal potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, the automatic model reduction technique has the potential to generalize to other network models. The methodology offers a scalable and adaptable tool for applications beyond biomedical research. Its ability to dynamically adjust model complexity based on system-specific needs ensures that models remain both computationally feasible and scientifically relevant, accommodating new data and evolving understandings of complex phenomena.",Sci Rep
40121165,Phenotypic alterations in peripheral blood B Lymphocytes of patients with Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Dysfunction of humoral immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The distribution of B lymphocyte subsets and their clinical relevance in AD remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution of peripheral blood B lymphocyte subsets and their relevance with cognition and biomarkers in AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated the immunophenotype of peripheral B lymphocytes in 27 AD patients confirmed by PET-Amyloid scan and 32 cognitively normal controls.
RESULTS: The phenotype of B lymphocytes is altered in AD patients. AD patients exhibit a decrease in both the numbers and proportions of switched memory (SwM) B cells and double-negative (DN) B cells. The proportion of unswitched memory (USwM) B cells was increased after in vitro stimulation. Additionally, B cells that produce proinflammatory cytokines including GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and TNF-α are increased, while those that produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are decreased in AD patients after in vitro stimulation. These alterations in B cell populations were linked to cognitive functions and biomarkers, including Aβ42/40 and pTau181, in AD patients.
DISCUSSION: This study reveals an altered B-lymphocyte phenotype in AD patients, marked by functional and compositional dysregulation. Further research incorporating mechanistic, longitudinal, and functional studies is needed to determine whether these immune perturbations directly contribute to AD pathogenesis or arise as secondary effects of neurodegeneration.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40149759,Cortico-Cortical Paired Associative Stimulation (ccPAS) in Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease: A Quali-Quantitative Approach to Potential Therapeutic Mechanisms and Applications.,"Background/Objectives: Cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose a major challenge for the ageing population, with impaired synaptic plasticity playing a central role in their pathophysiology. This article explores the hypothesis that cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can restore synaptic function by targeting impaired spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a key mechanism disrupted in AD. Methods: We reviewed existing studies investigating the effects of ccPAS on neuroplasticity in both ageing and AD populations. Results: Findings suggest age-specific effects, with ccPAS improving motor performance in young adults but showing limited efficacy in older adults, likely due to age-related declines in synaptic plasticity and cortical excitability. In AD, ccPAS studies reveal significant impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity, while long-term depression (LTD)-like mechanisms appear relatively preserved, emphasising the need for targeted neuromodulation approaches. Conclusions: Despite promising preliminary results, evidence remains limited and largely focused on motor function, with the impact of ccPAS on cognitive domains still underexplored. To bridge this gap, future research should focus on larger and more diverse cohorts to optimise ccPAS protocols for ageing and AD populations and investigate its potential for enhancing cognitive function. By refining stimulation parameters and integrating neuroimageing-based personalisation strategies, ccPAS may represent a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating neuroplasticity deficits in ageing and neurodegenerative conditions.",Brain Sci
40133248,"Decreased practice effects in cognitively unimpaired amyloid betapositive individuals: a multicenter, longitudinal, cohort study.","INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine whether cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid- beta-positive (Aβ+) individuals display decreased practice effects on serial neuropsychological testing.
METHODS: We included 209 CU participants from three research centers, 157 Aβ- controls and 52 Aβ+ individuals. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline and annually during a 2-year follow-up. We used linear mixed-effects models to analyze cognitive change over time between the two groups, including time from baseline, amyloid status, their interaction, age, sex, and years of education as fixed effects and the intercept and time as random effects.
RESULTS: The Aβ+ group showed reduced practice effects in verbal learning (β = -1.14, SE = 0.40, p = 0.0046) and memory function (β = -0.56, SE = 0.19, p = 0.0035), as well as in language tasks (β = -0.59, SE = 0.19, p = 0.0027).
DISCUSSION: Individuals with normal cognition who are in the Alzheimer's continuum show decreased practice effects over annual neuropsychological testing. Our findings could have implications for the design and interpretation of primary prevention trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: This was a multicenter study on practice effects in asymptomatic Aβ+ individuals. We used LME models to analyze cognitive trajectories across multiple domains. Practice-effects reductions might be an indicator of subtle cognitive decline. Implications on clinical and research settings within the AD field are discussed.",Alzheimers Dement

Secondary outcomes included quality of life, sleep quality, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden (Barthel Index, Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PDQI), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)].
RESULTS: DBS patients showed significantly greater improvements in MMSE, MoCA, FIM, and ZBI scores than controls, suggesting improved cognitive function and quality of life, and reduced caregiver burden (p < 0.05). Notably, DBS significantly reduced HAM-A, HAM-D, and PSQI scores, and improved NPI scores more than controls, indicating significant amelioration of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a safe and reversible treatment that potentially enhances cognitive function and quality of life in severe AD patients and alleviates caregiver burden. For the first time, we report that DBS also improves neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders, highlighting its clinical potential in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40102200,Acute Restraint Stress Induces Long-Lasting Synaptic Enhancement by Inhibiting AMPK Activation in AD Model Mice.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a gradual synaptic loss. The progression of AD severely affects late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP), which is essential for long-term memory consolidation.
AIM: We have previously demonstrated the beneficial effects of acute restraint stress (ARS) on hippocampal LTP in AD mouse models. This study aimed to verify the effects and potential mechanisms of ARS on the maintenance of hippocampal L-LTP in two AD mouse models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 5xFAD and Tg2576 mice underwent a 30-min body immobilization protocol to induce ARS, followed by electrophysiological recordings of L-LTP (> 3 h) in the CA1 region of thehippocampus.
RESULTS: The ARS-exposed group exhibited significantly enhanced L-LTP compared to the control group. Maintenance of L-LTP requires new protein synthesis and signaling via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Our findings revealed that ARS increased hippocampal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and reduced AMPK activity. Inactivation of AMPK and subsequent activation of the mTOR pathway were strongly associated with the ARS-facilitated enhancement of L-LTP. Furthermore, our experiments using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin demonstrated that it effectively prevented the enhancement of L-LTP following ARS, underscoring the pivotal role of mTOR in this process.
CONCLUSION: ARS may significantly modify AMPK activation and mTOR regulation in L-LTP, potentially triggering the mechanisms of long-term memory consolidation in AD mouse model mice. Identifying these underlying mechanisms could help promote the development of novel pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of AD.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40032156,Astrocytic GluN2A alleviates sleep deprivation-induced elevation of Aβ through regulating neprilysin and AQP4 via the calcineurin/NFAT pathway.,"Sleep disorders can increase amyloid beta (Aβ) burden in the brain and are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The precise mechanism by which sleep disturbances elevate Aβ levels is unclear. Our previous study has demonstrated that knocking down encoding gene Grin2a of astrocytic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors GluN2A subunit could aggravate sleep deprivation (SD)-induced elevation of Aβ, indicating a protective role of astrocytic GluN2A in SD; but the underlying mechanism needs to be further elucidated. In our present study, using rat models of SD combined with specific astrocytic Grin2a knockdown or overexpression in the hippocampus, and a cell model of primary cultured hippocampal astrocytes, we reveal a novel mechanism that astrocytic GluN2A alleviates SD-induced increases in Aβ. We demonstrated that astrocytic GluN2A mainly affected Aβ degradation and clearance through regulating degradation enzyme neprilysin and Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), via the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Our study provides supportive evidence for the novel role and mechanism of astrocytic GluN2A in Aβ elimination, which would contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for Aβ-related diseases such as AD.",Prog Neurobiol
40099354,Why is it Difficult to Recruit/Retain Asian American Family Caregivers in a Virtual Intervention?,"BACKGROUND: Virtual interventions using computers and mobile devices have increasingly been developed and tested among racial and ethnic minorities in recent years. Yet, few virtual interventions have been developed for Asian American midlife women who are family caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, little is known about the feasibility of recruiting this specific group of racial/ethnic minority midlife women to a virtual intervention study.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to discuss practical issues in recruiting and retaining this specific group of racial/ethnic minority midlife women for a virtual intervention study.
METHODS: The ongoing parent study is to develop and test a preliminary version of a virtual intervention for this specific population. During the research process, the research team had regular meetings to have discussions on recruitment and retention issues and each team member wrote research diaries. A content analysis was conducted with the written records including the research team's research diaries and meeting minutes.
RESULTS: The issues were: (1) an extremely small pool of Asian American midlife women who were family caregivers of persons living with AD; (2) competitions with other studies, (3) practicality of inclusion/exclusion criteria, (4) lack of time and interests in research participation, and (5) negative perception of small monetary incentives.
CONCLUSION: Future researchers need to consider the unique cultural and social dynamics of this specific population, foster trusted connections with the communities before initiating the study, and obtain feedback from potential gatekeepers and the communities in advance.",West J Nurs Res
40059628,"Design, synthesis, biological evaluation, and X-ray single crystal structure of novel computer-aided-drug-designbased α-mangostin derivatives: Multifunctional ligands against Alzheimer's disease.","Multifunctional ligand design strategy may be a promising approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). α-Mangostin (α-M), a natural small molecule with anti-AD properties, was used as the lead compound for the design and synthesis of six α-M derivatives (1-6) with the help of computer-aided-drug-design (CADD). Both theoretical calculations and experimental results suggested that 1-6 might serve as promising selective butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors and amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation inhibitors. Meanwhile, experimental results confirmed the high selectivity of the derivatives, in which 1 had the best inhibitory activity and selectivity on BuChE (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.016 µM, SI = 700.63). The experimental results also showed that 1-6 could act as copper chelators and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers. Furthermore, in vivo experiments with Caenorhabditis elegans also showed that 1 could scavenge ROS and inhibit Aβ aggregation. Notably, single crystals of 1, 4, and the 4-Cu(II) complex were prepared for the first time, which provided a reliable structural basis for analyzing the structure-activity relationship. The dimethylamino derivatives (1, 4) of α-M showed the best activities and were expected to become promising candidate drugs for multifunctional anti-AD.",Arch Pharm (Weinheim)
40063368,The temporal organization and quality of life story memories in Alzheimer disease and healthy controls.,"OBJECTIVE: Autobiographical memory has been studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by asking for a specified number of memories from a few defined life periods. The present study tests whether a retrograde temporal gradient and a change in the quality of memory specificity is confirmed when using a temporally less restrained access to autobiographical memory. Also, we intended to explore the temporal macrostructure of entire life narratives in AD and to study in more detail the distribution of memories across the past life and the narrativity of memory reports.
METHOD: Twenty-one elderly adults with mild to moderate AD (Mage = 79.0; M Mini-Mental State Exam = 20.6) were compared with 20 healthy controls (Mage = 76.15, M Mini-Mental State Exam = 29.2). Participants were ethnic Germans from a rural southwestern area of Germany. They provided five most important memories and then told their entire life for up to 15 min. Life narratives were divided into temporal-thematic segments, which were dated and coded for memory specificity as well as for proportion of narrative clauses (narrativity).
RESULTS: Life narratives in AD were shorter and contained proportionally fewer specific memories and fewer narrative clauses. These differences regarded the remembered period from between mid-30s to the recent past, for which also far fewer memories were produced. Life narratives were less chronological.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining a sense of self-sameness in AD relies less and less on life narratives but more on single-event narratives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",Neuropsychology
40164279,A review: From old drugs to new solutions: The role of repositioning in alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Drug repositioning or drug reprofiling, involves identifying novel indications for approved and previously abandoned drugs in the treatment of other diseases. The traditional drug discovery process is tedious, time-consuming, risky, and challenging. Fortunately, the inception of the drug repositioning concept has expedited the process by using compounds with established safety profiles in humans, and thereby significantly reducing costs. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the brain with limited and less effective therapeutic interventions. Researchers have attempted to identify potential treatment of AD from existing drug however, the success of drug repositioning strategy in AD remains uncertain. This article briefly discusses the importance and effectiveness of drug repositioning strategies, the major obstacles in the development of drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD), approaches to address these challenges, and the role of machine learning in identifying early markers of AD for improved management.",Neuroscience
39984462,Early Alzheimer's Disease with frequent neuritic plaques harbors neocortical tau seeds distinct from primary age-related tauopathy.,"Tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques are required for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and closely track with cognitive impairment, yet cognitively normal aged individuals frequently exhibit NFTs arising from tau seed accumulation. This may suggest that not all tau species are equally pathogenic and raises the question of whether unidentified tau modifications augment tau seeding activity and neurodegeneration in AD. We investigated how biochemical modifications of tau relate to clinicopathological outcomes in a cohort of 38 patients with Braak-matched AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) or primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a 3R/4R tauopathy with identical tau filament core structure to ADNC but with little to no Aβ deposition. We comprehensively measured tau histologic density, seeding activity using real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) seed amplification assays, and select post-translational modifications (PTMs) (i.e. pT217, pS202/T205, & C-terminal epitopes) in hippocampus and neocortex. Even in cases without overt neocortical tau neuropathology, substantial hippocampal and neocortical tau seeding occurred in both PART and ADNC and predicted region-specific cognitive performance and longitudinal decline. Notably, tau seeding and PTM profiles were associated with Aβ neuritic plaque density and differentiated ADNC from PART in neocortex. Our data indicate that tau seed modifications meaningfully relate to disease trajectory, potentially explaining the more severe cognitive dysfunction observed in late-stage AD versus PART.",Nat Commun
40136780,Risk Assessment Profiles for Caregiver Burden in Family Caregivers of Persons Living with Alzheimer's Disease: An Exploratory Study with Machine Learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) places a profound global challenge, driven by its escalating prevalence and the multifaceted strain it places on individuals, families, and societies. Family caregivers (FCs), who are pivotal in supporting family members with AD, frequently endure substantial emotional, physical, and psychological demands. To better understand the determinants of family caregiving strain, this study employed machine learning (ML) to develop predictive models identifying factors that contribute to caregiver burden over time. Participants were evaluated across sociodemographic clinical, psychophysiological, and psychological domains at baseline (T1; N = 130), six months (T2; N = 114), and twelve months (T3; N = 92). Results revealed three distinct risk profiles, with the first focusing on T2 data, highlighting the importance of distress, forgiveness, age, and heart rate variability. The second profile integrated T1 and T2 data, emphasizing additional factors like family stress. The third profile combined T1 and T2 data with sociodemographic and clinical features, underscoring the importance of both assessment moments on distress at T2 and forgiveness at T1 and T2, as well as family stress at T1. By employing computational methods, this research uncovers nuanced patterns in caregiver burden that conventional statistical approaches might overlook. Key drivers include psychological factors (distress, forgiveness), physiological markers (heart rate variability), contextual stressors (familial dynamics, sociodemographic disparities). The insights revealed enable early identification of FCs at higher risk of burden, paving the way for personalized interventions. Such strategies are urgently needed as AD rates rise globally, underscoring the imperative to safeguard both patients and the caregivers who support them.",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ

Among flavonoids, 3',4',5,7-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF), a structural analog of luteolin, has gained attention for its favorable pharmacokinetics and potential neuroprotective properties. Despite the significant neuroprotective effects and favorable pharmacokinetics of TMF, its efficacy and mechanism of action in AD remain unclear. This study explored TMF's pharmacological effects in AD models, highlighting its ability to improve memory and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. TMF reduced Aβ plaques, NFTs formation, and glial activation while suppressing neuroinflammation through the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. Further analysis in LPS-induced BV2 cells revealed TMF's ability to reduce microglial activation. These findings highlight the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of TMF, suggesting its potential as a treatment for AD.",Mar Drugs
40057772,"Diabetes status, duration, and risk of dementia among ischemic stroke patients.","BACKGROUND: The influence of duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the likelihood of developing new-onset dementia in post-stroke population is not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the duration of T2DM and the risk of developing dementia in the post-stroke population.
METHODS: Leveraging the Korean National Health Insurance Database, this study included 118,790 individuals with a history of stroke but no previous dementia diagnosis. We classified diabetes status into five categories: normoglycemia, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), newly diagnosed T2DM, and established T2DM with durations of less than 5 years and 5 years or more. The primary endpoint was the incidence of all-cause dementia.
RESULTS: Among 118,790 participants (average age 64.26 ± 9.95 years, 48% male), 16.7% developed dementia during an average follow-up of 7.3 ± 2.3 years. Participants with a history of T2DM for less than five years at cohort entry had a 26.7% higher risk of developing all-cause dementia compared to those with normoglycemia. Those with T2DM for five years or longer had a 46.7% increased risk, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.466 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.408-1.527). Specifically, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) rose by 43.4% and 51.4%, respectively, for individuals with T2DM lasting more than five years (aHR 1.434, 95% CI 1.366-1.505; aHR 1.514, 95% CI 1.365-1.679, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated a significant association between an extended duration of T2DM and an increased risk of developing all-cause dementia, including AD and VaD in post-stroke population. These results emphasize proactive dementia prevention approaches in stroke survivors, particularly those with longstanding T2DM.",Alzheimers Res Ther
40107929,"Neuroimaging of psychosis, agitation, and affective disturbance in Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVES: This study identifies neuropsychiatric syndromes and investigates their relationship with neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography data were collected for 281, 68, and 180 patients with AD, DLB, and MCI, respectively, from three Japanese institutions. Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used for exploratory factor analysis in each group. Statistical Parametric Mapping was exploited to reveal the relationships between each factor score and cerebral volume or perfusion with age, sex, dementia severity, and the other factor scores as covariates.
RESULTS: Three factors (psychosis, agitation, and affective disturbance) were extracted for AD. For DLB, nighttime behavior and aberrant motor behavior were extracted as independent symptoms with the same three factors. Four factors (psychosis, agitation, anxiety, and apathy) were extracted for MCI. A positive relationship between agitation and cerebral volume in the left middle frontal gyri and left caudate was observed in AD. In DLB, agitation was positively correlated with cerebral perfusion in the left dominant regions, including the middle frontal gyri and caudate. Psychosis and perfusion were negatively correlated in the left extent regions, including the temporo-parieto-occipital lobe, insula, and inferior frontal gyri in DLB. Psychosis was significantly associated with lower perfusion in the bilateral occipital lobes, whereas apathy was significantly correlated with a lower volume of the right dominant bilateral frontal lobes in MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Three neuropsychiatric syndromes - psychosis, agitation, and affective disturbance - may heterogeneously associate with AD, DLB, and MCI.",Int Psychogeriatr
40005231,Promising Natural Remedies for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.,"This study examines the intricacies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), its origins, and the potential advantages of various herbal extracts and natural compounds for enhancing memory and cognitive performance. Future studies into AD treatments are encouraged by the review's demonstration of the effectiveness of phytoconstituents that were extracted from a number of plants. In addition to having many beneficial effects, such as improved cholinergic and cognitive function, herbal medicines are also much less harmful, more readily available, and easier to use than other treatments. They also pass without difficulty through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study focused on natural substances and their effects on AD by using academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2024. According to the literature review, 66 phytoconstituents that were isolated from 21 distinct plants have shown efficacy, which could be encouraging for future research on AD therapies. Since most clinical trials produce contradictory results, the study suggests that larger-scale studies with longer treatment durations are necessary to validate or refute the therapeutic efficacy of herbal AD treatments.",Molecules
40122271,Exosome-based therapeutics: Advancing drug delivery for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders include Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, cause gradual neuronal loss, protein misfolding, and accumulation, resulting in severe cognitive and movement deficits. Despite substantial study, therapeutic interventions are hampered by the blood-brain barrier, which prevents medication distribution to the central nervous system. Traditional pharmaceutical methods, such as small compounds, peptides, and inhibitors, have shown minimal effectiveness in addressing this obstacle. Exosomes are nanoscale membrane-bound vesicles that are primarily engaged in intercellular communication. They have the inherent capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier, which allows them to be used as medication delivery vehicles for brain illness therapy. Exosomes may be derived from a variety of cells like microglia, astrocytes identified according to origin, increasing their flexibility as drug delivery vehicles. Advanced engineering approaches optimise exosomes for tailored distribution across the blood-brain barrier, paving the path for novel neurodegenerative disease treatments. This review discusses the promise of exosome-based drug delivery, focussing on their composition, biogenesis, engineering, and applications in treating central nervous system illnesses, eventually overcoming the unmet hurdles of crossing the blood-brain barrier.",Mol Cell Neurosci
39976515,TREM2 in Regulating Macrophage Inflammatory Responses and Disease Pathogenesis.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a cell surface receptor belonging to the TREM family that is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells such as granulocytes, monocytes, osteocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Although much of the functionality of TREM2 is not well understood at the molecular level, it is well established that TREM2 plays a significant role in the regulation of a broad definition of macrophage inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of TREM2 has been implicated in a large number of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Nasu-Hakola disease, bone-related diseases, and atherosclerosis. The TREM2 gene is highly conserved evolutionarily and at the level of controlling its expression. The function of TREM2 is highly conserved across the broad definition of macrophages, including microglia, osteoclasts, and vascular macrophages. This genetic and physiological ""niche conservatism"" strongly suggests its pivotal role in regulating inflammatory responses. This mini-review summarizes our current understanding of the structure, expression, and function of TREM2 in the pathogenesis of macrophage-mediated diseases.",Crit Rev Immunol
40134954,Unveiling the Therapeutic Potential of Banxia Xiexin Decoction in Alzheimer's Disease: Insights From Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with various pathological states for which there is no effective treatment. First documented in the Eastern Han Dynasty's medical classic, ""Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases"" (200-210 Anno Domini), Banxia Xiexin Decoction (BXD) stands as a quintessential approach to treating spleen ailments. Recent studies have shown BXD's effectiveness in mitigating memory impairment associated with AD. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying BXD's action against AD require further exploration.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the important components of BXD in exerting anti-AD effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms using network pharmacology, metabolomics analysis, and in vitro and in vivo validation strategies. Initially, candidates for BXD's application in AD therapy were identified through extensive database searches, followed by an analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI). To elucidate BXD's therapeutic pathways in AD, we engaged in Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) assessments. Further, we delved into BXD's primary constituents through ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with Q Exactive mass spectrometry and molecular docking techniques. Finally, AD-associated Aβ<sub>42</sub>-SY5Y cells and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice models were utilized to further determine the activity and mechanisms of BXD through various molecular or phenotypic assays and metabolomics analysis.
RESULTS: Our findings identified the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as central to BXD's effects. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found the activity of BXD against AD to be mediated by the suppression of neuroinflammation and apoptosis, accompanied by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Finally, we observed robust changes in metabolite levels in the plasma of BXD-treated APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: Through systematic data analysis and experimental validation, the therapeutic advantages and fundamental molecular mechanisms of BXD in treating AD were revealed. These findings underscore the promising prospects and compelling potential of BXD, which targets the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inflammation, apoptosis, as a therapeutic strategy for improving AD.",Drug Des Devel Ther
39988890,Generation of an Inducible Destabilized-Domain Cre Mouse Line to Target Disease Associated Microglia.,"The function of microglia during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be investigated using mouse models that enable genetic manipulation of microglial subpopulations in a temporal manner. We developed mouse lines that express either Cre recombinase (Cre) for constitutive targeting, or destabilized-domain Cre recombinase (DD-Cre) for inducible targeting from the Cst7 locus (Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup>) to specifically manipulate disease associated microglia (DAM) and crossed with Ai14 tdTomato cre-reporter line mice. Cst7<sup>Cre</sup> was found to target all brain resident myeloid cells, due to transient developmental expression of Cst7, but no expression was found in the inducible Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup> mice. Further crossing of this line with 5xFAD mice combined with dietary administration of trimethoprim to induce DD-Cre activity produces long-term labeling in DAM without evidence of leakiness, with tdTomato-expression restricted to cells surrounding plaques. Using this model, we found that DAMs are a subset of plaque-associated microglia (PAMs) and their transition to DAM increases with age and disease stage. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that tdTomato+ cells show higher expression of disease and inflammatory genes compared to other microglial populations, including non-labeled PAMs. These models allow either complete cre-loxP targeting of all brain myeloid cells (Cst7<sup>Cre</sup>), or inducible targeting of DAMs, without leakiness (Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup>).",Glia
40081274,Inspired by pathogenic mechanisms: A novel gradual multi-modal fusion framework for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its progression involves complex pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, disturbed by gene variants, the regulation of gene expression ultimately changes brain structure, resulting in the progression of brain diseases. However, the existing works rarely take these mechanisms into account when designing their diagnosis methods. Therefore, we propose a novel gradual multi-modal fusion framework to fuse representative data from each stage of disease progression in hybrid feature space, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene expression (GE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, to integrate genetic sequence and expression data, we design a SNP-GE fusion module, which performs multi-modal fusion to obtain genetic embedding by considering the relation between SNP and GE. Compared with SNP-GE fusion, representation of genetic embedding and MRI have more obvious heterogeneity, especially correlation with disease. Therefore, we propose to align the manifold of genetic and imaging representations, which can explore the high-order relationship between imaging and genetic data in the presence of modal heterogeneity. Our proposed framework was validated using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and achieved diagnosis accuracy of 76.88%, 72.84%, 87.72%, and 95.00% for distinguishing MCI from control normal, lately MCI from early MCI, MCI from AD, and AD from control normal, respectively. Additionally, our proposed framework helps to identify some multi-modal biomarkers related to MCI progression. In summary, our proposed framework is effective not only for MCI diagnosis but also for guiding the further development of genetic and imaging-based brain studies.

This study integrated and analyzed the relevant literature from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) on the application of AI in Alzheimer's disease (AD), covering publications from 2004 to 2023.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the key research hotspots and trends of the application of AI in AD over the past 20 years through a bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: Using the Web of Science Core Collection database, we conducted a comprehensive visual analysis of literature on AI and AD published between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2023. The study utilized Excel, Scimago Graphica, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace software to visualize trends in annual publications and the distribution of research by countries, institutions, journals, references, authors, and keywords related to this topic.
RESULTS: A total of 2,316 papers were obtained through the research process, with a significant increase in publications observed since 2018, signaling notable growth in this field. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom made notable contributions to this research area. The University of London led in institutional productivity with 80 publications, followed by the University of California System with 74 publications. Regarding total publications, the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease was the most prolific while Neuroimage ranked as the most cited journal. Shen Dinggang was the top author in both total publications and average citations. Analysis of reference and keyword highlighted research hotspots, including the identification of various stages of AD, early diagnostic screening, risk prediction, and prediction of disease progression. The ""task analysis"" keyword emerged as a research frontier from 2021 to 2023.
CONCLUSION: Research on AI applications in AD holds significant potential for practical advancements, attracting increasing attention from scholars. Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as a key research focus for AD diagnosis. Future research will explore AI methods, particularly task analysis, emphasizing integrating multimodal data and utilizing deep neural networks. These approaches aim to identify emerging risk factors, such as environmental influences on AD onset, predict disease progression with high accuracy, and support the development of prevention strategies. Ultimately, AI-driven innovations will transform AD management from a progressive, incurable state to a more manageable and potentially reversible condition, thereby improving healthcare, rehabilitation, and long-term care solutions.",Front Neurosci
40018519,Deciphering novel mitochondrial signatures: multi-omics analysis uncovers cross-disease markers and oligodendrocyte pathways in Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM) are severe neurological disorders that pose significant global healthcare challenges. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction, remain poorly understood. A major limitation in current studies is the lack of cell-specific markers that effectively represent mitochondrial dynamics in AD and GBM.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data using 10 machine learning algorithms to identify mitochondria-associated cell-specific markers. We validated these markers through the integration of gene expression and methylation data across diverse cell types. Our dataset comprised single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from AD patients, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from GBM patients, and additional DNA methylation and transcriptomic data from the ROSMAP, ADNI, TCGA, and CGGA cohorts.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified four significant cross-disease mitochondrial markers: EFHD1, SASH1, FAM110B, and SLC25A18. These markers showed both shared and unique expression profiles in AD and GBM, suggesting a common mitochondrial mechanism contributing to both diseases. Additionally, oligodendrocytes and their interactions with astrocytes were implicated in disease progression, particularly through the APP signaling pathway. Key hub genes, such as HS6ST3 and TUBB2B, were identified across different cellular subpopulations, highlighting a cell-specific co-expression network linked to mitochondrial function.",Front Aging Neurosci
40057236,Alzheimer's disease prediction using 3D-CNNs: Intelligent processing of neuroimaging data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurological illness that demolishes memory and brain functioning. This disease affects an individual's capacity to work, think, and behave. The proportion of individuals suffering from AD is rapidly increasing. It flatters a leading cause of disability and impacts millions of people worldwide. Early detection reduces disease expansion, provides more effective therapies, and leads to better results. However, predicting AD at an early stage is complex since its clinical symptoms match with normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and neurodegenerative disorders. Prior studies indicate that early diagnosis is improved by the utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, MRI data is scarce, noisy, and extremely diverse among scanners and patient populations. The 2D CNNs analyze 3D data slices separately, resulting in a loss of inter-slice information and contextual coherence required to detect subtle and diffuse brain alterations. This study offered a novel 3Dimensional-Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and intelligent preprocessing pipeline for AD prediction. This work uses an intelligent frame selection and 3D dilated convolutions mechanism to recognize the most informative slices associated with AD disease. This enabled the model to capture subtle and diffuse structural changes across the brain visible in MRI scans. The proposed model examined brain structures by recognizing small volumetric changes associated with AD and acquiring spatial hierarchies within MRI data. After conducting various experiments, we observed that the proposed 3D-CNNs are highly proficient in capturing early brain changes. To validate the model's performance, a benchmark dataset called AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is used and achieves a maximum accuracy of 92.89 %, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",SLAS Technol
40062260,Predicting amyloid proteins using attention-based long short-term memory.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorders that mostly occur when people get old. It can be recognized by severe memory impairment in the late stage, affecting cognitive function and general daily living. Reliable evidence confirms that the enhanced symptoms of AD are linked to the accumulation of amyloid proteins. The dense population of amyloid proteins forms insoluble fibrillar structures, causing significant pathological impacts in various tissues. Understanding amyloid protein's mechanisms and identifying them at an early stage plays an essential role in treating AD as well as prevalent amyloid-related diseases. Recently, although several machine learning methods proposed for amyloid protein identification have shown promising results, most of them have not yet fully exploited the sequence information of the amyloid proteins. In this study, we develop a computational model for in silico identification of amyloid proteins using bidirectional long short-term memory in combination with an attention mechanism. In the testing phase, our findings showed that the model developed by our proposed method outperformed those developed by state-of-the-art methods with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9126.",PeerJ Comput Sci
40143051,Targeting Neuroinflammation in Central Nervous System Diseases by Oral Delivery of Lipid Nanoparticles.,"Neuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is a primary characteristic of CNS diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and mental disorders. The excessive activation of immune cells results in the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently induce neuronal death and accelerate the progression of neurodegeneration. Therefore, mitigating excessive neuroinflammation has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of CNS diseases. Despite advancements in drug discovery and the development of novel therapeutics, the effective delivery of these agents to the CNS remains a serious challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This underscores the need to develop a novel drug delivery system. Recent studies have identified oral lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a promising approach to efficiently deliver drugs across the BBB and treat neurological diseases. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the recent advancements in the development of LNPs designed for the controlled delivery and therapeutic modulation of CNS diseases through oral administration. Furthermore, this review addresses the mechanisms by which these LNPs overcome biological barriers and evaluate their clinical implications and therapeutic efficacy in the context of oral drug delivery systems. Specifically, it focuses on LNP formulations that facilitate oral administration, exploring their potential to enhance bioavailability, improve targeting precision, and alleviate or manage the symptoms associated with a range of CNS diseases.",Pharmaceutics
39986483,Hallmarks of aging and Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis: Paving the route for new therapeutic targets.,"Aging is the leading risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Understanding the intricate interplay between biological aging and the AD pathophysiology may help to discover innovative treatments. The relationship between aging and core pathways of AD pathogenesis (amyloidopathy and tauopathy) have been extensively studied in preclinical models. However, the potential discordance between preclinical models and human pathology could represent a limitation in the identification of new therapeutic targets. This narrative review aims to gather the evidence currently available on the associations of β-Amyloid and Tau pathology with the hallmarks of aging in human studies. Briefly, our review suggests that while several hallmarks exhibit a robust association with AD pathogenesis (e.g., epigenetic alterations, chronic inflammation, dysbiosis), others (e.g., telomere attrition, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion) demonstrate either no relationship or weak associations. This is often due to limitations such as small sample sizes and study designs, being either cross-sectional or with short follow-up intervals, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Distinct hallmarks play varying roles in different stages of AD pathology, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies with longer follow-up periods. Considering the intricate interconnections across the hallmarks of aging, future research on AD pathology should focus on multiple hallmarks simultaneously.",Ageing Res Rev
40151908,Gamma oscillation modulation for cognitive impairment: A systematic review.,"BackgroundGamma oscillation modulation has emerged as a potential non-invasive treatment to counteract cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), gamma sensory stimulation (GSS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) show promise in supporting specific cognitive functions.ObjectiveTo review and evaluate the efficacy of gamma oscillation modulation techniques in benefiting cognitive functions among individuals with AD and MCI.MethodsA systematic review was conducted, analyzing studies from 2015 to 2023 across databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria focused on studies involving tACS, GSS, or TMS applied to older adults with MCI or AD. A total of 438 articles were screened, of which 10 met the eligibility criteria.ResultsFindings suggest that gamma tACS, especially targeting the precuneus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, benefits episodic memory and cognitive performance. GSS also showed potential in supporting memory and attention, while TMS exhibited inconsistent but promising results when applied to the angular gyrus. However, heterogeneity in study designs and small sample sizes limit the generalizability of these outcomes.ConclusionsGamma oscillation modulation offers potential cognitive benefits for patients with AD and MCI, particularly in memory support. Further studies with larger samples and well-designed protocols are needed to confirm its therapeutic efficacy and optimize intervention parameters.",J Alzheimers Dis
40129526,Trends in mortality due to ischemic heart diseases among patients with Alzheimer's disease in the United States from 1999 to 2020.,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart diseases (IHD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) significantly contribute to mortality in aging population. Understanding mortality trends where these conditions overlap is crucial for developing targeted interventions for vulnerable populations.
METHODS: We analyzed CDC WONDER mortality data from 1999 to 2020 for individuals aged ≥45 years. IHD and AD mortality were identified using ICD-10 codes I20-I25 and G30, respectively. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 were calculated, and trends were analyzed by gender, race, region, place of death and state. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate annual percentage changes (APC) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 171,080 deaths were attributed to IHD in individuals with AD from 1999 to 2020. The AAMR decreased from 10.6 in 1999 to 4.1 in 2020, with a significant decline between 2004 and 2014 (APC: -7.73; 95 % CI: -8.42 to -7.24). Females exhibited higher overall AAMR compared to males (Females: 6.8 vs. Males: 6.4). Individuals of Non-Hispanic (NH) White ancestry had the highest AAMR (6.8), followed by those of NH Black (6.5) and Hispanic ancestry (5.9). The West region reported the highest AAMR at 7.9, while the Midwest had the lowest at 6.3. Oklahoma recorded the highest state-level AAMR (10.9), while Utah had the lowest (3.2).
CONCLUSIONS: IHD mortality in individuals with AD declined significantly, with disparities by gender, race, and geography. These findings underscore the need for tailored public health approaches to address the evolving burden of IHD in AD patients.",Int J Cardiol Cardiovasc Risk Prev
40156268,Multi-omics delineate growth factor network underlying exercise effects in an Alzheimer's mouse model.,"INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise is a primary defense against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We conducted single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) on the hippocampus of mice carrying mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup>) following prolonged voluntary wheel-running exercise.
RESULTS: Exercise mitigates amyloid-induced changes in transcriptome and chromatin accessibility through cell type-specific regulatory networks converging on growth factor signaling, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The beneficial effects of exercise on neurocognition can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and its downstream PI3K signaling. Exercise leads to elevated levels of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), and intranasal administration of HB-EGF enhances memory function in sedentary APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice.
DISCUSSION: These findings offer a panoramic delineation of cell type-specific hippocampal transcriptional networks activated by exercise and suggest EGFR signaling as a druggable contributor to exercise-induced memory enhancement to combat AD-related cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq analysis of APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice after prolonged wheel-running. Exercise counteracts amyloid-induced transcriptomic and accessibility changes. Networks converge on the activation of EGFR and insulin signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and PI3K blocked cognitive benefits of exercise. Intranasal HB-EGF administration enhances memory in sedentary APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice.",Alzheimers Dement
39979198,The gut-organ axis: Clinical aspects and immune mechanisms.,"The gut-brain axis exemplifies the bidirectional connection between the intestines and the brain, as evidenced by the impact of severe stress on gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain and diarrhea, and conversely, the influence of abdominal discomfort on mood. Clinical observations support the notion of the gut-brain connection, including an increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with depression and anxiety, as well as the association of changes in the gut microbiota with neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. The gut and brain communicate via complex mechanisms involving inflammatory cytokines, immune cells, autonomic nerves, and gut microbiota, which contribute to the pathogenesis in certain gut and brain diseases. Two primary pathways mediate the bidirectional information exchange between the intestinal tract and the brain: signal transduction through bloodstream factors, such as bacterial metabolites and inflammatory cytokines, and neural pathways, such as neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines within the autonomic nervous system through the interaction between the nerve cells and beyond. In recent years, the basic mechanisms of the pathophysiology of the gut-brain axis have been gradually elucidated. Beyond the gut-brain interaction, emerging evidence suggests the influence of the gut extends to other organs, such as the liver and lungs, through intricate inter-organ communication pathways. An increasing number of reports on this clinical and basic cross-organ interactions underscore the potential for better understanding and novel therapeutic strategies targeting inter-organs networks. Further clarification of interactions between multiorgans premises transformative insights into cross-organ therapeutic strategies.",Allergol Int
40092812,Development and Optimization of Piracetam and Shatavarin IV-Loaded Nanoemulsion for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy: In Silico and Experimental Analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge due to cognitive decline resulting from nerve cell degeneration. Shatavarin IV, a prominent bioactive compound fromAsparagus racemosus and Piracetam, has been investigated for its neuroprotective potential. This study examines the molecular docking, formulation, and characterization of a nanoemulsion containing Piracetam and Shatavarin IV for treating AD. The in silico study demonstrated that Shatavarin IV exhibited strong binding affinities with multiple AD-related targets, including TNF-α (-7.29 kcal/mol), the GSK-3 axin complex (-9.6785 kcal/mol), amyloid-β (-6.8326 kcal/mol), and GSK-3 β (-8.8243 kcal/mol). The extraction of Shatavarin IV from Asparagus racemosus roots yielded 401.1 ± 2.3 mg with a purity of 66%, as confirmed by HPTLC. A combination index study revealed a synergistic effect with a CI value of 0.10843 at a 1:1 ratio of Piracetam and Shatavarin IV. The nanoemulsion was optimized using a Box-Behnken design, with oil concentration, surfactant mixture (S <sub>mix</sub>), and sonication time as key factors. The optimized formulation exhibited a particle size of 183.6 nm and a PDI of 0.194. Characterization techniques, including TEM and DSC, confirmed the uniformity, stability, and incorporation of the drugs in the nanoemulsion. The in vitro drug release study revealed a significantly higher release profile (84.30 ± 1.03% in 24 h) for the nanoemulsion than the drug suspension. Ex vivo studies demonstrated a superior permeability rate for the nanoemulsion (56.35 ± 1.19%) compared to the conventional suspension. Additionally, the nanoemulsion showed enhanced antioxidant activity compared with the pure extract. Stability studies indicated that the formulation remained stable with only minor changes in particle size, PDI, and zeta potential over time. This nanoemulsion presents a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",ACS Omega
40058668,Voluntary wheel exercise improves learning and memory impairment caused by hippocampal Hb-α deficiency by reducing microglial activation and reversing synaptic damage.,"Decreased hemoglobin (Hb) levels in peripheral blood may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hb-α is a monomeric form of Hb that exists in the central nervous system. Our previous RNA sequencing results revealed a decrease in the expression of the Hb-α gene in the hippocampus of AD model mice. However, the effects of Hb-α deficiency in the hippocampus on cognitive function and the underlying mechanism are unclear. Running exercise has been shown to improve cognition, but whether it can reverse the damage caused by Hb-α deficiency in the hippocampus needs to be further researched. In the present study, Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses revealed that lower levels of mean corpuscular Hb and Hemoglobin alpha 1 (HBA1) increased the risk of developing AD. When an adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to knock down hippocampal Hb-α, the learning and memory ability of the resulting model mice decreased, similar to that of AD model mice. Moreover, the expression levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and their receptor (RAGE) were upregulated, microglia were activated, and the number of engulfed synapses increased, which damaged the number and structure of hippocampal synapses in the model mice. However, four weeks of voluntary wheel exercise effectively improved these conditions. In addition, we found that voluntary wheel exercise may compensate for Hb-α protein deficiency in the hippocampus by increasing the expression levels of Hb-α protein in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and other brain regions without altering Hb-α mRNA in the hippocampus of model mice. These results highlight the key role of Hb-α in hippocampal synaptic damage, elucidate the mechanism by which running exercise improves cognition by connecting the peripheral circulation and central nervous system through Hb-α, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Brain Behav Immun
40090538,The neuroprotective role of Humanin in Alzheimer's disease: The molecular effects.,"Humanin (HN) is an endogenous micropeptide also known as a mitochondria-derived peptide. It has a neuroprotective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases by improving hippocampal acetylcholine and attenuating the development of oxidative stress and associated neurotoxicity. HN protects the neuron from the toxic effects of amyloid beta (Aβ). HN is regarded as a biomarker of mitochondrial stress. Interestingly, aging reduces brain expression of HN, leading to cognitive impairment and elevating the risk of neurodegeneration, including AD. However, in old subjects and AD patients, circulating HN levels increase as a compensatory mechanism to reduce neurodegeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Conversely, other studies demonstrated a reduction in circulating HN levels in AD. These findings indicated controversial points regarding the precise mechanistic role of HN in AD. Therefore, the aim of this review was to discuss the exact role of HN in AD neuropathology and also to discuss the molecular mechanisms of HN in AD.",Eur J Pharmacol
40043053,Human CD33 deficiency is associated with mild alteration of circulating white blood cell counts.,"The single pass transmembrane protein CD33 is enriched in phagocytic and hematopoietic cell types, such as monocytes. CD33 is thought to be associated with immune cell function, susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease, and rare leukemias. Antagonism or genetic ablation of CD33 has been proposed to treat Alzheimer's disease, hematological cancers, and as a selection mechanism for enriching genetically altered blood cells. To understand the impact of chronic CD33 loss or ablation, we describe individuals who we confirmed to be missing CD33 due to germline loss of function variants. Through PheWAS-based approaches using existing whole exome biobanks and bespoke phenotyping using recall-by-genotype (RBG) studies, we show that CD33 loss of function alters circulating white blood cell counts and distributions, albeit mildly and with no overt clinical pathology. These findings indicate that chronic CD33 antagonism/ablation is likely to be safe in humans.",PLoS Genet
40020826,Comparation of brain-targeting chitosan/sodium tripolyphosphate and ovalbumin/sodium carboxymethylcellulose nanoparticles on dihydromyricetin delivery and cognitive impairment in obesity-related Alzheimer's disease.,"The brain-gut axis plays an important role in regulating cognitive ability in obesity-related Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between the barrier penetration ability of the DMY nanodelivery system in vivo and the regulation of the gut-brain axis to alleviate cognitive impairment. Brain-targeted peptide (TGN: TGNYKALHPHNG) and DMY loaded chitosan (CS)/sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles (TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs) and ovalbumin (OVA)/sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) nanoparticles (TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs) were prepared. TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs demonstrated superior mucus penetration and BBB targeting ability compared to TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs, while the latter showed notable intestinal accumulation. TGN-DMY-CS/TPP-NPs treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Alistipes and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and TGN-DMY-OVA/CMC-NPs treatment obviously enhanced the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. Furthermore, both nanoparticles alleviated lipid metabolism disorder, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the liver, reduced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic plasticity in obesity-related AD mice. Despite different mucus penetration and biodistribution, their similar efficacy in improving obesity-related AD is attributed to the gut-brain bidirectional connection.",Int J Biol Macromol
40142943,Trojan Horse Delivery Strategies of Natural Medicine Monomers: Challenges and Limitations in Improving Brain Targeting.,"Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, significantly impact patients' quality of life and impose substantial economic burdens on society. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the effective delivery of most therapeutic drugs, especially natural products, despite their potential therapeutic effects. The Trojan Horse strategy, using nanotechnology to disguise drugs as ""cargo"", enables them to bypass the BBB, enhancing targeting and therapeutic efficacy. This review explores the applications of natural products in the treatment of CNS diseases, discusses the challenges posed by the BBB, and analyzes the advantages and limitations of the Trojan Horse strategy. Despite the existing technical challenges, future research is expected to enhance the application of natural drugs in CNS treatment by integrating nanotechnology, improving delivery mechanisms, and optimizing targeting characteristics.",Pharmaceutics
40026845,A comprehensive analysis of MAPT-related genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease.,"Despite some research into the correlation between microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) rs2471738 and the risk of AD, the findings remain inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the association between MAPT rs2471738 and the susceptibility to AD, as well as potential molecular mechanisms involved. We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Embase, Medline, and Web of Science to investigate the relationship between MAPT rs2471738 and the risk of AD. We employed meta-analysis and Expression Quantitative Trait Loci analysis to elucidate the association between MAPT rs2471738 and AD risk, as well as to uncover potential molecular mechanisms. Aggregated results suggest that the rs2471738T allele increases the risk of developing AD under the allelic model (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.26, I² = 64.9 %). Additionally, our findings indicate that the rs2471738CT+TT genotype escalates the risk of AD under the dominant model (OR = 1.23, 95 % CI = 1.07-1.41, I² = 79.2 %). Moreover, rs2471738 regulates the expression of MAPT in the human hippocampus (P = 0.04). Our result suggested that rs2471738 may potentially increase the risk of AD by modulating the expression of MAPT in human brain tissue.",IBRO Neurosci Rep
40149715,Ramp Sequence May Explain Synonymous Variant Association with Alzheimer's Disease in the Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha (PILRA).,"Background: The synonymous variant NC_000007.14:g.100373690T&gt;C (rs2405442:T&gt;C) in the Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha (PILRA) gene was previously associated with decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in genome-wide association studies, but its biological impact is largely unknown. Objective: We hypothesized that rs2405442:T&gt;C decreases mRNA and protein levels by destroying a ramp of slowly translated codons at the 5' end of PILRA. Methods: We assessed rs2405442:T&gt;C predicted effects on PILRA through quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. RESULTS: Both mRNA (p = 1.9184 × 10<sup>-13</sup>) and protein (p = 0.01296) levels significantly decreased in the mutant versus the wildtype in the direction that we predicted based on the destruction of a ramp sequence. Conclusions: We show that rs2405442:T&gt;C alone directly impacts PILRA mRNA and protein expression, and ramp sequences may play a role in regulating AD-associated genes without modifying the protein product.",Biomedicines
40153032,Investigation of cognitive functions in patients with rosacea: a case-control study.,"Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disease and the most prevalent cause of facial redness in adults. It is also associated with various systemic conditions. This study aimed to evaluate cognitive function in patients with rosacea and compare it to healthy controls. A total of 119 individuals, comprising 58 patients with rosacea and 61 controls, were enrolled between April 2023 and September 2024. The Trail Making Test (TMT) was administered to all the participants to assess their cognitive function. In rosacea patients, TMT Part A was 37.9 ± 4.38, and TMT Part B was 73.4 ± 13.28. In the control group, TMT Part A was 38.5 ± 4.86, and TMT Part B was 72.0 ± 9.34 (p = 0.57, p = 0.47, respectively). Based on rosacea severity, the patients were categorized as mild to moderate (n = 35) and severe to very severe (n = 23). There was no significant difference between these groups in TMT Part A and TMT Part B (p = 0.97, p = 0.24, respectively). In addition, according to the rosacea subtype, there was no difference between the groups in TMT Part A, TMT Part B, and years of education (p = 0.58, p = 0.89, and p = 0.20, respectively). Since rosacea may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and Parkinson's disease, TMT can be used to investigate cognitive functions.",Arch Dermatol Res
40156795,Cognitive And Neuroprotective Effects of Vernonia amygdalina in scopolamine-induced Memory impaired Rats.,"Cognitive impairment is largely associated with functional and structural loss in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, and scopolamine has been successfully used to mimic these deficits in rodents. The cost and side effects of drugs presently used for the treatment of AD-related cognitive impairment have prompted research into alternative products, especially natural ones with high antioxidant capacity, since oxidative stress is a major pathophysiology associated with AD. The current study evaluated the cognitive and neuroprotective effects of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Thirty-five male rats, randomly divided into seven groups (n = 5), were used. Group 1 served as the control and received distilled water. Groups 2 and 3 received Vernonia amygdalina, VA (50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively) per orally (p.o.). Group 4 received 1 mg/kg scopolamine SC (i.p.). Groups 5, 6, and 7 received pretreatment with either VA 50 mg/kg, VA 100 mg/kg, or Donepezil, DP (1 mg/kg), and then in combination with SC (1 mg/kg). The animals were subjected to memory tasks using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition tasks (NORT) and sacrificed on day 14, after which their brains were isolated for biochemical and histological studies. The study showed that during MWM and NORT, spatial and non-spatial recognition memories, which were respectively impaired in the SC group compared to the control group, were reversed in the VA pretreatment groups. Scopolamine injection caused significant decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase levels and an increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in group 4 compared with the control group. Pretreatments with either VA or DP, however, caused a significant increase in the SOD and catalase levels and a decrease in the MDA level compared with the SC group. Histological studies revealed that VA was more potent in protecting the brain against SC-induced neurodegeneration and morphological alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Findings of this study suggest that VA attenuates scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits via inhibition of oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration and enhancement of cognition in the brains of rats.",Niger J Physiol Sci
40056496,Biomarkers of cellular senescence predict risk of mild cognitive impairment: Results from the lifestyle interventions for elders (LIFE) study.,"OBJECTIVES: Cellular senescence, characterized by a marked and multifactorial senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), is a potential unifying mechanism of aging and chronic disease. Most studies of the SASP have focused on frailty and other functional outcomes. Senescent cells have been detected in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, but few studies have examined associations between plasma SASP markers and cognition. The objective of this study was to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma SASP markers and mild cognitive impairment among older adults at high risk of mobility disability.
DESIGN: The Lifestyle Interventions for Elders (LIFE) study was a randomized controlled trial of a group-based physical activity program compared to a ""successful aging"" health education program to assess effects on major mobility disability that was conducted from February 2010 to December 2013.
SETTING: Recruitment occurred at eight centers in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: We included 1,373 participants enrolled in the study with baseline measures of 27 biomarkers of cellular senescence and adjudication of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia at baseline and 24-month follow-up. At baseline, participants were aged 70-80, sedentary, and at high risk of mobility disability.
MEASUREMENTS: A neuropsychological assessment was administered at baseline and 24 months post-randomization. At both timepoints, a clinical adjudication committee determined whether individuals had a diagnosis of cognitively normal, MCI, or dementia; individuals with dementia at baseline were excluded. The concentrations of 26 of the 27 plasma proteins identified as components of the SASP were measured with commercially available Luminex xMAP multiplex magnetic bead-based immunoassays analyzed on the MAGPIX System while 1 protein (Activin A) was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of each senescence biomarker, in quartiles, with baseline or incident MCI. Models stratified by clinical site and adjusted for intervention assignment, age, gender, race, and education. Among 1,373 participants, 117 (8.5%) were diagnosed with MCI at baseline. Increasing quartiles of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was associated with higher odds of MCI compared to quartile 1 (Q2: OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.74-2.45; Q3: OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.80-2.59; Q4: OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.02-3.22). Additionally, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) quartiles 2-4 had lower odds of MCI compared to quartile 1 (Q2: OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.35-1.02; Q3: OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.33-0.98; Q4: OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.37-1.08). Of the 1,256 cognitively unimpaired participants at baseline, 141 (11.2%) were diagnosed with incident MCI or dementia at the 24-month follow-up. Compared to quartile 1, increasing baseline quartiles of MPO (Q2: OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.63-1.92; Q3: OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.80-2.33; Q4: OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.16-3.25) and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7, Q2: OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.47-1.62; Q3: OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.85-2.55; Q4: OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.28-3.65) were associated with increased odds of MCI or dementia at 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults at high risk of mobility disability, high plasma MPO was cross-sectionally and, along with MMP7, longitudinally associated with increased odds of MCI and dementia. In contrast, high MMP1 was cross-sectionally associated with reduced odds of MCI.",J Nutr Health Aging
39991517,Apolipoprotein E: A Potential Prognostic and Diagnostic Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is one of the strongest genetic determinants of the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may also increase the risk of cancer. However, its importance goes far beyond this. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the potential role and prognostic value of APOE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using bioinformatics and multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mIHC).
METHODS: Clinicopathologic samples from 90 hCC patients enrolled between April 2007 and June 2012 were included in this study. Researchers used tissue microarrays (HLiv180Su09) and multiple fluorescent immunohistochemical analyses to validate APOE protein expression and patient prognosis. Several online databases were used to investigate APOE expression and prognosis in HCC, followed by a comprehensive analysis of correlations between APOE and clinicopathologic features, immune cell infiltration levels, immune checkpoint genes, mutations, and functional enrichment analysis. The distribution of APOE in immune cell populations was also determined using a single-cell database.
RESULTS: APOE mRNA was significantly overexpressed in HCC at both transcriptional and translational levels. Survival analysis suggested that APOE might be a favorable prognostic indicator for HCC patients. In addition to its involvement in immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, genetic variation, immunomodulatory genes, and methylation alterations in HCC, enrichment analysis showed that APOE was involved in multiple cancer-related signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively examines the critical role of APOE in HCC and highlights its significant potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. This finding not only paves the way for new avenues of research in HCC, but also provides valuable insights into clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.",J Hepatocell Carcinoma
40120042,The HDL-Mimetic Peptide 4F Mitigates Vascular and Cortical Amyloid Pathology and Associated Neuroinflammation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Despite recent advances, more effective and safer treatment options for AD are needed. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral vasculature and is associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. CAA is also considered to underlie the main adverse effect of recently FDA-approved anti-Aβ immunotherapies, namely the amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Substantial evidence has shown that elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein component, APOA-I, are associated with reduced CAA and superior cognitive function. 4F is an APOA-I/HDL-mimetic peptide and its clinical safety and activity have been demonstrated in human trials for cardiovascular diseases. The present study investigates whether treatment with 4F modulates CAA and associated cognitive deficits and neuropathologies in the well-established Tg-SwDI mouse model of CAA/AD. Age/sex-matched Tg-SwDI mice received daily treatments of 4F or vehicle (PBS), respectively, by intraperitoneal injections for 12 weeks. The results showed that 4F treatment reduced overall Aβ plaque deposition and CAA, and attenuated CAA-associated microgliosis, without significantly affecting total levels of Aβ, astrocytosis, and behavioral function. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed a heightened inflammatory state in the brain of SwDI mice and that 4F treatment reversed the overactivation of vascular cells, in particular vascular smooth muscle cells, relieving cerebrovascular inflammation in CAA/AD mice. Our study provides experimental evidence for the therapeutic potential of 4F to mitigate CAA and associated pathologies in AD.",Mol Neurobiol
40005161,Untargeted Lipidomic Reveals Potential Biomarkers in Plasma Samples for the Discrimination of Patients Affected by Parkinson's Disease.,"Nowadays, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains essentially clinical, based on the subjective observations of clinicians. In addition, misdiagnosis with other neuro disorders, such as Alzheimer's (AD), can occur. Herein, an untargeted lipidomic analysis of 75 plasma samples was performed to identify lipid species capable of discriminating between these two neuro groups. Therefore, PLS-DA and OPLS-DA analysis revealed significant differences in patient profiles in the sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid categories. As a result, a putative lipid biomarker panel was developed, which included HexCer (40:1; O2) and PC (O-32:0), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 80, respectively. This panel was effective in discriminating between diseased and healthy subjects, but most importantly, it could discriminate between two neurodegenerative disorders that can present similar symptoms, namely PD and AD. Together, these findings suggest that the dysregulated metabolism of lipids plays a critical role in AD and PD pathology and may represent a valuable clinical tool for their diagnosis. Thus, further targeted studies are encouraged to better understand the underlying mechanisms of PD and confirm the diagnostic potency of the identified lipid metabolites.",Molecules

However, the role of these risk factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of mid-life 10-year ASCVD risk with late-life amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration [AT(N)] measures and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs).
METHODS: Participants enrolled in the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study between 2003-2005 (mid-life) and underwent brain MRI and PET scans in 2018-2022 (age >65 years, late-life) to detect and quantify amyloid (A, PiB-PET) and tau (T, Flortaucipir (FTP) PET) deposition, cortical thickness (N) and WMHs. Mid-life ASCVD risk was categorized as; borderline (5%-7.4%), intermediate (7.5%-<15%), or high (≥15%). Association of mid-life ASCVD risk HR (95% CI) was assessed using logistic and linear regressions with A, T, or N and chi square beta coefficients for WMH in late life.
RESULTS: Over a ∼16 years follow up, in 135 participants (mean age 73 years), mid-life ASCVD risk categories had a graded association with neurodegeneration (OR<sub>ASCVD high vs low risk%</sub> 6.98 [2.44-19.95]; p &lt; 0.05) driven primarily by self-identified Black race and age, while none with A and T. ASCVD risk score was also associated with WMHs ((β=0.42 ± 0.22; p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In this asymptomatic, diverse cohort, 10-year ASCVD risk was predictive of late-life neurodegeneration and WMHs but not amyloid or tau. Further mechanistic studies can elucidate whether midlife ASCVD risk factors associated neurodegeneration initiates brain vulnerability leading to AD in late life.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40134415,Early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease through data fusion of MRI and DTI images using the YOLOv11 neural network.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, affecting over 55 million people globally, with numbers expected to rise dramatically. Early detection and classification of AD are crucial for improving patient outcomes and slowing disease progression. However, conventional diagnostic approaches often fail to provide accurate classification in the early stages. This paper proposes a novel approach using advanced computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems and the YOLOv11 neural network for early detection and classification of AD. The YOLOv11 model leverages its advanced object detection capabilities to simultaneously localize and classify AD-related biomarkers by integrating multimodal data fusion of T2-weighted MRI and DTI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected and annotated based on known AD biomarkers, and the YOLOv11 model was trained to classify AD into four stages: Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The model achieved exceptional performance, with 93.6% precision, 91.6% recall, and 96.7% mAP50, demonstrating its ability to identify subtle biomarkers by combining MRI and DTI modalities. This work highlights the novelty of using YOLOv11 for simultaneous detection and classification, offering a promising strategy for early-stage AD diagnosis and classification.",Front Neurosci
40135662,Pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease: Contrasting the vulnerable locus coeruleus to the resilient substantia nigra.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) selectively affects certain brain regions, yet the mechanisms of selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. The neuromodulatory subcortical system, which includes nuclei exhibiting a range of vulnerability and resilience to AD-type degeneration, presents a framework for uncovering these mechanisms.
METHODS: We leveraged transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry in paired samples from human post mortem tissue representing a vulnerable and resilient region-the locus coeruleus (LC) and substantia nigra (SN). These regions have comparable anatomical features but distinct vulnerability to AD.
RESULTS: We identified significant differences in cholesterol homeostasis, antioxidant pathways, KRAS signaling, and estrogen signaling at a bulk transcriptomic level. Notably, evidence of sigma-2 receptor upregulation was detected in the LC.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight pathways differentiating the LC and SN, potentially explaining the LC's selective vulnerability in AD. Such pathways offer potential targets of disease-modifying therapies for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Intraindividual comparative RNAseq was used to study selective vulnerability. Metallothionein genes are significantly enriched in the substantia nigra. Cholesterol homeostatic genes are significantly enriched in the locus coeruleus. The locus coeruleus is likely more susceptible to toxic amyloid beta oligomers.",Alzheimers Dement
40087204,Traumatic Brain Injury and Gut Microbiome: The Role of the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Processes.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A deeper understanding of the communication network between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, termed the gut-brain axis (GBA), has revealed new potential targets for intervention to prevent the development of neurodegenerative disease associated with tramatic brain injury (TBI). This review aims to comprehensively examine the role of GBA post-traumatic brain injury (TBI).
RECENT FINDINGS: The GBA functions through neural, metabolic, immune, and endocrine systems, creating bidirectional signaling pathways that modulate brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract physiology. TBI perturbs these signaling pathways, producing pathophysiological feedback loops in the GBA leading to dysbiosis (i.e., a perturbed gut microbiome, impaired brain-blood barrier, impaired intestinal epithelial barrier (i.e., ""leaky gut""), and a maladaptive, systemic inflammatory response. Damage to the CNS associated with TBI leads to GI dysmotility, which promotes small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO has been associated with the early stages of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Many of the bacteria associated with this overgrowth promote inflammation and, in rodent models, have been shown to compromise the structural integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, causing malabsorption of essential nutrients and further exacerbating dysbiosis. TBI-induced pathophysiology is strongly associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, which represents a significant public health burden and challenge for patients and their families. A healthy gut microbiome has been shown to promote improved recovery from TBI and prevent the development of neurodegenerative disease, as well as other chronic complications. The role of the gut microbiome in brain health post-TBI demonstrates the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate TBI-associated comorbidities. Promising new evidence on prebiotics, probiotics, diet, and fecal microbiota transplantation may lead to new therapeutic options for improving the quality of life for patients with TBI. Still, many of these preliminary findings must be explored further in clinical settings. This review covers the current understanding of the GBA in the setting of TBI and how the gut microbiome may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment in this patient population.",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep
40118994,Classification method based on surf and sift features for alzheimer diagnosis using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementia in the elderly, poses a challenge for early diagnosis due to its progressive nature and hidden microstructural changes. While traditional T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> weighted MRI can assess macro-structural brain atrophy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) unveils these hidden microstructural alterations. This study explores the use of DTI data, specifically visual patterns in Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD) maps, to characterize AD progression. This paper proposes a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework employing SIFT and SURF descriptors and a bag-of-words approach to build AD-specific signatures for the hippocampus region, known to be heavily affected by the disease. These signatures are extracted from MD, FA, and RD maps and used to differentiate between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal controls (NC) in both multiclass and binary classification scenarios. Additionally, we investigate late fusion of visual map features for enhanced decision-making. The experiments were accomplished with a subset of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset formed of AD patients (n = 35), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) (n = 6), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) (n = 24) and cognitively healthy elderly Normal Controls (NC) (n = 31). Promising preliminary results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system as a useful tool to capture the AD leanness with achieving accuracies of 87.5%, 87.4%, 89%, and 95.2% for MD, FA, RD, and fusion of features respectively for the multiclass system using SIFT features. Using FA features for binary discrimination achieves 97.5%. Moreover, the fusion based on the decision level model reached an accuracy of 93.3% AD/MCI, 95.7% AD/NC, and 93.3% MCI/NC (96.2 ± 3.6 MCI vs. NC, 97.5 ± 5 AD vs. NC). Furthermore, fusion of features led to a noteworthy precision boost of 96%. These findings suggest that our DTI-based CAD framework holds promise as a reliable and accurate tool for capturing AD progression, paving the way for earlier diagnosis and potentially improved patient outcomes.",Sci Rep
40059211,Antiageing strategy for neurodegenerative diseases: from mechanisms to clinical advances.,"In the context of global ageing, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is increasing. However, the current symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies have achieved limited benefits for neurodegenerative diseases in clinical settings. Halting the progress of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline or even improving impaired cognition and function are the clinically meaningful goals of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Ageing is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases and their associated comorbidities, such as vascular pathologies, in elderly individuals. Thus, we aim to elucidate the role of ageing in neurodegenerative diseases from the perspective of a complex system, in which the brain is the core and peripheral organs and tissues form a holistic network to support brain functions. During ageing, the progressive deterioration of the structure and function of the entire body hampers its active and adaptive responses to various stimuli, thereby rendering individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, we propose that the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases should be grounded in holistic antiageing and rejuvenation means complemented by interventions targeting disease-specific pathogenic events. This integrated approach is a promising strategy to effectively prevent, pause or slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",Signal Transduct Target Ther
40167418,Cross-Interaction with Amyloid-β Drives Pathogenic Structural Transformation within the Amyloidogenic Core Region of TDP-43.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the world's most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized neuropathologically by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed by amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. Notably, a subset of AD patients also exhibits pathological aggregates composed of TAR DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43). Clinically, the presence of TDP-43 copathology in AD correlates with more severe cognitive decline and faster disease progression. While previous studies have shown that TDP-43 can exacerbate Aβ toxicity and modulate its assembly dynamics by delaying fibrillization and promoting oligomer formation, the impact of the Aβ interaction on the structural dynamics and aggregation of TDP-43 remains unclear. Here, we employed all-atom discrete molecular dynamics simulations to study the direct interaction between Aβ42, the more amyloidogenic isoform of Aβ, and the amyloidogenic core region (ACR) of TDP-43, which spans residues 311-360 and is critical for TDP-43 aggregation. We found that monomeric Aβ42 could strongly bind to the ACR, establishing sustained contact through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In contrast, simulation of ACR dimerization revealed a transient helix-helix interaction, experimentally known to drive the phase separation behavior of TDP-43. The binding of the ACR to an Aβ42 fibril seed resulted in significant structural transformation, with the complete unfolding of the helical region being observed. Furthermore, interaction with the Aβ42 fibril seed catalyzed the formation of a parallel, in-register intermolecular β-sheet between two ACR monomers. Collectively, our computational study provides important theoretical insights into TDP-43 pathology in AD, demonstrating that Aβ42, especially in its fibrillar form, may catalyze the pathogenic structural transformation within the TDP-43 ACR that initiates its aberrant aggregation.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40008329,Amyloid-β deposition predicts oscillatory slowing of magnetoencephalography signals and a reduction of functional connectivity over time in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"With the ongoing developments in the field of anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer's disease, it is crucial to better understand the longitudinal associations between amyloid-β deposition and altered network activity in the living human brain. We included 110 cognitively unimpaired individuals (67.9 ± 5.7 years), who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]flutemetamol (amyloid-β)-PET imaging and resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording at baseline and 4-year follow-up. We tested associations between baseline amyloid-β deposition and MEG measures (oscillatory power and functional connectivity). Next, we examined the relationship between baseline amyloid-β deposition and longitudinal MEG measures, as well as between baseline MEG measures and longitudinal amyloid-β deposition. Finally, we assessed associations between longitudinal changes in both amyloid-β deposition and MEG measures. Analyses were performed using linear mixed models corrected for age, sex and family. At baseline, amyloid-β deposition in orbitofrontal-posterior cingulate regions (i.e. early Alzheimer's disease regions) was associated with higher theta (4-8 Hz) power (β = 0.17, P &lt; 0.01) in- and lower functional connectivity [inverted Joint Permutation Entropy (JPE<sub>inv</sub>) theta, β = -0.24, P &lt; 0.001] of these regions, lower whole-brain beta (13-30 Hz) power (β = -0.13, P &lt; 0.05) and lower whole-brain functional connectivity (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.18, P &lt; 0.001). Whole-brain amyloid-β deposition was associated with higher whole-brain theta power (β = 0.17, P &lt; 0.05), lower whole-brain beta power (β = -0.13, P &lt; 0.05) and lower whole-brain functional connectivity (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.21, P &lt; 0.001). Baseline amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions also predicted future oscillatory slowing, reflected by increased theta power over time in early Alzheimer's disease regions and across the whole brain (β = 0.11, β = 0.08, P &lt; 0.001), as well as decreased whole-brain beta power over time (β = -0.04, P &lt; 0.05). Baseline amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions also predicted a reduction in functional connectivity between these regions and the rest of the brain over time (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.07, P &lt; 0.05). Baseline whole-brain amyloid-β deposition was associated with increased whole-brain theta power over time (β = 0.08, P &lt; 0.01). Baseline MEG measures were not associated with longitudinal amyloid-β deposition. Longitudinal changes in amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions were associated with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of early Alzheimer's disease regions (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.19, P &lt; 0.05) and the whole brain [corrected amplitude envelope correlations alpha (8-13 Hz), β = -0.22, P &lt; 0.05]. Finally, longitudinal changes in whole-brain amyloid-β deposition were associated with longitudinal changes in whole-brain relative theta power (β = 0.21, P &lt; 0.05). Disruptions of oscillatory power and functional connectivity appear to represent early functional consequences of emerging amyloid-β deposition in cognitively unimpaired individuals. These findings suggest a role for neurophysiology in monitoring disease progression and potential treatment effects in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun
40031689,A Dual-Modal Fusion Framework for Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Autobiographical Memory.,"This paper introduces a dual-modal early cognitive impairment detection system based on autobiographical memory (AM) tests, and our approach is to automatically extract pre-defined acoustic features and self-designed embeddings to enhance linguistic representation of the spontaneous speech data. By integrating dual-modal data, we effectively enrich the features that aid in model learning, especially addressing the subtle symptoms exhibited by individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage between healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To account for spontaneous speech's unstructured and implicit nature, two additional embeddings, namely, speaker embedding and conversation embedding, are introduced to augment the information available for model learning, thus enriching the feature set for improving the model accuracy. The proposed dual-modal approach is tested on a self-collected Chinese spontaneous speech dataset due to the limited unstructured speech open-access dataset for MCI detection. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through a series of experiments, including ablation studies, to determine the impact of each module on overall performance. The proposed system achieved an average accuracy of 78% in detecting MCI, demonstrating its comparative effectiveness. Enhancements in our system are achieved by integrating a directional encoder tailored to capture temporal information across sequential visits. This addition leads to a 3% increase in detection accuracy within a subset of participants who have undergone multiple AM test sessions. Implementing such a longitudinal approach in analyzing unstructured speech data for MCI detection taps into a relatively underexplored area of research, offering new insights.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40065353,Identification of enterotype for patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by behavioral and dysexecutive deficits. Its pathogenesis is closely associated with the intestinal flora. This study aimed to explore the enterotypes in AD by identifying key bacteria through machine learning and species co-occurrence network analysis.
METHODS: The collection of fecal samples from AD patients was followed by 16 S rRNA analysis using QIIME2. Enterotype clustering was conducted at the genus level, and deep neural network (DNN) classification models were developed for AD and healthy controls within each enterotype.
RESULTS: Analysis of three 16 S rRNA gut microbiome datasets identified three distinct enterotypes: Escherichia_Shigella (ET-E), Faecalibacterium (ET-F), and Bacteroides (ET-B). The ET-E is mainly characterized by the absence of Akkermansia in AD group. The Akkermansia was significantly positively correlated with Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group and negatively correlated with biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. The ET-F highly expressed Agathobacter, un_f__Lachnospiraceae, Lachnoclostridium, and low expressed Dorea in AD group. Among them, Agathobacter was significantly positively correlated with un_f__Lachnospiraceae, and un_f__Lachnospiraceae was significantly positively correlated with Lachnoclostridium. The Dorea was significantly negatively correlated with Lachnoclostridium. The AD from ET-B group had high expression of two beneficial bacteria, Butyricicoccus and Parabacteroides. The findings suggest that the ET-E enterotype may predispose individuals to AD, with Akkermansia identified as a potential risk factor. Conversely, the ET-B enterotype appears to be associated with milder symptoms, with Butyricicoccus and Parabacteroides potentially serving as protective factors. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the species characteristics and interactions within different enterotypes is essential for modulating the gut-brain axis and mitigating AD symptoms.",J Transl Med
40122583,A retrospective study on blood microbiota as a marker for cognitive decline: implications for detecting Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment in Republic of Korea.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between blood microbiota, specifically bacterial DNA, and cognitive decline in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The objective was to identify potential microbial signatures that could serve as biomarkers for cognitive deterioration.
METHODS: Forty-seven participants were recruited, including 13 with aMCI, 20 with SCD, and 14 normal cognition (NC). Blood samples were collected, and microbial DNA was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatics analyses-including α- and β-diversity measures and differential abundance testing (using edgeR)-were employed to assess microbial diversity and differences in bacterial composition among groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive impact of the microbiota on cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Microbial diversity differed significantly between groups, with NC exhibiting the highest α-diversity. Both the aMCI and SCD groups showed reduced diversity. Taxa such as Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Clostridia were significantly decreased in the aMCI group compared to NC (p<0.05). In contrast, Gammaproteobacteria increased significantly in the aMCI group compared to both NC and SCD, indicating progressive microbial changes from SCD to aMCI. No significant differences were found between the NC and SCD groups.
CONCLUSION: Distinct bacterial taxa-particularly the increase in Gammaproteobacteria along with decreases in Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Clostridia-are associated with the progression of cognitive decline. These findings suggest that blood microbiota could serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection of aMCI. However, the small sample size and the lack of control for confounding factors such as diet and medication limit the findings. Larger studies are needed to validate these results and further explore the role of microbiota in neurodegeneration.",Osong Public Health Res Perspect
39992729,"Integrative Study of Plantago lanceolata L.: Phytochemical Properties and Therapeutic Effects on Cancer, Diabetes, and Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease is linked with diabetes and cancer, emphasising the need for effective treatments. Plantago lanceolata, recognised as safe by various pharmacopeias, was investigated in this study for therapeutic potential. We examined the effects of its leaf extracts and sub-extracts (methanol, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol, aqueous) on AChE, BChE, α-amylase, α-glucosidase enzymes, as well as their impact on HDF-a and U87-MG cancer cells. The phytochemical characterisation was performed using ICP-MS and LC-MS/MS. Cytotoxic effects were evaluated on HDF-a and U87-MG cell lines, along with assessments for nuclear abnormalities. Na and K were detected in extracts, with isoleucine and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside being the most concentrated compounds. Extracts at concentrations exceeding 25 µg/mL significantly increased cytotoxicity in HDF-a cell lines compared to the control group, without inducing nuclear abnormalities. Methanol extract demonstrated moderate inhibition against AChE and BChE at concentrations of 100 µg/mL and 500 µg/mL, respectively. These findings suggest that extracts exhibit potential therapeutic effects.",Nat Prod Res
40011745,Cryo-EM structure of the human THIK-1 K2P K<sup>+</sup> channel reveals a lower Y gate regulated by lipids and anesthetics.,"THIK-1 (KCNK13) is a halothane-inhibited and anionic-lipid-activated two-pore domain (K2P) K<sup>+</sup> channel implicated in microglial activation and neuroinflammation, and a current target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease and amyothropic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, compared to other K2P channels, little is known about the structural and functional properties of THIK-1. Here we present a 3.16-Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of human THIK-1 that reveals several distinct features, in particular, a tyrosine in M4 that contributes to a lower 'Y gate' that opens upon activation by physiologically relevant G-protein-coupled receptor and lipid signaling pathways. We demonstrate that linoleic acid bound within a modulatory pocket adjacent to the filter influences channel activity, and that halothane inhibition involves a binding site within the inner cavity, both resulting in conformational changes to the Y gate. Finally, the extracellular cap domain contains positively charged residues that line the ion exit pathway and contribute to the distinct biophysical properties of this channel. Overall, our results provide structural insights into THIK-1 function and identify distinct regulatory sites that expand its potential as a drug target for the modulation of microglial function.",Nat Struct Mol Biol
40094036,A Transcriptomic Signature of Depressive Symptoms in Late Life.,"BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms in late life can impair daily function and accompany cognitive decline. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these changes in the brain remain poorly understood.
METHODS: Differential expression analysis was performed on bulk-tissue RNA sequencing data generated from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of elderly participants in ROS/MAP (Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; N = 998, mean age at death = 89.7 years). Bulk tissue RNA sequencing was analyzed against depressive symptoms measured prior to death, controlling for Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, medication status, and lifestyle factors. Sex-stratified models were also tested.
RESULTS: Increased abundance of the Prader-Willi syndrome-associated gene PWAR1 (corrected p = 5.47 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and CTDSPL2 (corrected p = .03) were associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms in the combined sample. An additional 14 genes showed suggestive associations, including several with known links to neuropsychiatric illness (e.g., ACVR2B-AS1, COL19A1). Functional enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of aerobic metabolism and upregulation of both amino acid catabolism and DNA modification processes. Differential expression signatures were poorly correlated between males and females (Pearson r = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.13), and only the male group showed independently significant differential expression. Little overlap was found with previously published analyses of major depressive disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Building on recently published single-nucleus profiling, we present the largest-ever study of transcriptomic correlates of depressive symptoms in late life, revealing new insights into sex-specific regulators. PWAR1 and CTDSPL2 were identified as putative markers of late-life depression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and warrant further study.",Biol Psychiatry Glob Open Sci
40076682,An Update of Salivary Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognition and behavior impairments. Diagnosing AD early is important for clinicians to slow down AD progression and preserve brain function. Biomarkers such as tau protein and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) are used to aid diagnosis as clinical diagnosis often lags. Additionally, biomarkers can be used to monitor AD status and evaluate AD treatment. Clinicians detect these AD biomarkers in the brain using positron emission tomography/computed tomography or in the cerebrospinal fluid using a lumbar puncture. However, these methods are expensive and invasive. In contrast, saliva collection is simple, inexpensive, non-invasive, stress-free, and repeatable. Moreover, damage to the brain parenchyma can impact the oral cavity and some pathogenic molecules could travel back and forth from the brain to the mouth. This has prompted researchers to explore biomarkers in the saliva. Therefore, this study provides an overview of the main finding of salivary biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Based on these available studies, Aβ, tau, cholinesterase enzyme activity, lactoferrin, melatonin, cortisol, proteomics, metabolomics, exosomes, and the microbiome were changed in AD patients' saliva when compared to controls. However, well-designed studies are essential to confirm the reliability and validity of these biomarkers in diagnosing and monitoring AD.",Int J Mol Sci
40100148,Association of low bone mineral density and dementia in older women: insights from the Longevity Improvement and Fair Evidence Study.,"BACKGROUND: Both osteoporosis and dementia have emerged as important public health challenges in Japan's aging population. This study aimed to investigate the impact of low bone mineral density (BMD) on the subsequent risk of dementia in older Japanese women aged ≥65 years, given the overlapping demographics of individuals affected by these two conditions.
METHODS: This cohort study was conducted using osteoporosis screening data and insurance claims data from a municipality. We identified 8618 women (median age: 73 years) who underwent osteoporosis screening between April 2019 and March 2021. Participants with a BMD <80% of the young adult mean were assigned to a low-BMD group (n = 2297), whereas those with a BMD ≥80% were assigned to a control group (n = 6321). The study outcomes were new-onset all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). To estimate the risk of low BMD on these outcomes, we constructed Cox proportional hazards models that adjusted for covariates (age, care needs, year of cohort entry, comorbidities and medications) using inverse probability of treatment weighting.
RESULTS: The low-BMD group had a significantly higher risk of developing both all-cause dementia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.58, 95% confidence interval: 1.20-2.08) and AD (1.61, 1.11-2.36) than the control group over approximately 30 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that low BMD is associated with medium-term onset of dementia. Osteoporosis screenings could be useful not only for the secondary prevention of osteoporosis, but also for the primary prevention of dementia.",Age Ageing
40128240,The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment.,"Cost-effective, noninvasive screening methods for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders remain an unmet need. The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset. To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment. The ABHT was self-administered among cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (n = 127), participants with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; n = 34), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 19). Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers. Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment. Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.",Sci Rep
40019132,Assessing Public Awareness of Neuropsychiatric and Cognitive Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia: A Cross-sectional Study.,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia; it is expected to see global cases tripling by 2050. This study evaluates public awareness of AD in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, highlighting the need to improve background knowledge of AD and assess the impact of public education on early detection and management.
METHODOLOGY: This study was a cross-sectional study that targeted the public in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. It was conducted between June 2024 and October 2024. Data were collected using an online questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS software.
RESULTS: Our study involved 814 participants. A significant majority (94.7%) believe that brain-stimulating activities can delay AD onset. However, misconceptions persist, with 49.1% incorrectly thinking that AD can affect those in their 30s or 40s, though 86.9% correctly recognize it primarily affects those over 65 years of age. Awareness of cardiovascular health factors as risks was noted by 68.9% of participants, and 60.2% believed environmental toxins could also be a factor. Key recognized symptoms included difficulty in remembering events (76.5%), planning daily activities (65.4%), handling finances (59.7%), and confusion about time and place (79.7%). Furthermore, 80.1% understood that those with AD might better recall older events. The study also found a reliance on informal information sources, with 51.8% of participants guessing answers about the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Many participants understand that brain-stimulating activities might delay Alzheimer's onset, but significant misconceptions regarding its typical age of onset persist. Education programs using reliable sources are crucial for improving community understanding and management of the disease.",Ann Afr Med
40035974,Development of novel melatonin-isatin hybrids as multifunctional agents for Alzheimer's disease.,"The development of multifunctional agents has been a heated area of research for AD treatment in recent years. In this work, a series of melatonin-isatin hybrids were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional agents for treating AD. In vitro studies indicated that most of the synthesized compounds displayed moderate to good MAO-B inhibition activities and good antioxidant activities. In particular, compounds IM-5 and IM-10 exhibited the best inhibitory activities with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 12.4 μM and 15.6 μM against MAO-B, and potent antioxidant activities with their ORAC-FL values of 4.6 and 5.2 at 5 μM, respectively. ThT assay revealed compounds IM-5 and IM-10 exhibited the optimal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> self-induced aggregation inhibitory activities with the inhibition ratio of 72.8% and 69.7% at 20 μM. In addition, compounds IM-5 and IM-10 exhibited low cytotoxicities and significant neuroprotective effects on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury. More importantly, compounds IM-5 and IM-10 could significantly ameliorate the memory impairment and cognition injury in scopolamine-induced mice. The SwissADME program was used to predict drug-like properties of compounds IM-5 and IM-10 which exhibited they had good pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking study further manifested that compounds IM-5 and IM-10 showed high hMAO-B inhibitory potency. In summary, all above results revealed compounds IM-5 and IM-10 might be promising multifunctional agents for AD treatment.",Mol Divers
40070694,Leveraging near-real-time patient and population data to incorporate fluctuating risk of severe COVID-19: development and prospective validation of a personalised risk prediction tool.,"BACKGROUND: Novel strategies that account for population-level changes in dominant variants, immunity, testing practices and changes in individual risk profiles are needed to identify patients who remain at high risk of severe COVID-19. The aim of this study was to develop and prospectively validate a tool to predict absolute risk of severe COVID-19 incorporating dynamic parameters at the patient and population levels that could be used to inform clinical care.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of vaccinated US Veterans with SARS-CoV-2 from July 1, 2021, through August 25, 2023 was created. Models were estimated using logistic-regression-based machine learning with backward selection and included a variable with fluctuating absolute risk of severe COVID-19 to account for temporal changes. Age, sex, vaccine type, fully boosted status, and prior infection before vaccination were included a priori. Variations in individual risk over time, e.g., due to receipt of immune suppressive medications, were also potentially included. The model was developed using data from July 1, 2021, through August 31, 2022 and prospectively validated on a subsequent second cohort (September 1, 2022, through August 25, 2023). Model performance was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration by Brier score. The final model was used to compare observed rates of severe disease to predicted rates among patients who received oral antivirals.
FINDINGS: 216,890 SARS-CoV-2 infections in Veterans not treated with oral antivirals were included (median age, 65; 88% male). The development cohort included 165,303 patients (66,121 in the training set, 49,591 in the tuning set, and 49,591 in the testing set) and the prospective validation cohort included 51,587 patients. The percentage of severe infections ranged from 5% to 25%. Model performance improved until 24 clinical predictor variables including age, co-morbidities, and immune-suppressive medications plus a 30-day rolling risk window were included (AUC in development cohort, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87-0.88), AUC in prospective validation, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84-0.85), Brier Score, 0.13). The most important variables for predicting severe disease included age, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, and anaemia. Glucocorticoid use during the one-month prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was the next most important predictor. Models that included a near-real time fluctuating population risk variable performed better than models stratified by circulating variant and models with dominant variant included as a predictor. Patients with predicted severe disease risk >3% who received oral antivirals had approximately 4-fold lower rates of severe COVID-19 untreated patients at a similar risk level.
INTERPRETATION: Our novel risk prediction tool uses a simple method to adjust for temporal changes and can be implemented to facilitate uptake of evidence-based therapies. The study provides proof-of-concept for leveraging real-time data to support risk prediction that incorporates changing population-level trends and variation patient-level risk.

40119597,Comparison of the neuropsychological-actuarial and clinical-consensus approaches to diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in an ethnically diverse sample.,"Objective: Some studies show using neuropsychological-actuarial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) criteria may produce lower reversion rates (i.e. reverting from a cognitive diagnosis to no diagnosis) and higher associations with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers compared to conventional methods, but this has not been evaluated in a Hispanic sample. This study evaluated neuropsychological-actuarial MCI criteria performance in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) cohort compared to clinical-consensus diagnosis. Method: Data from 2,110 TARCC participants (47% Hispanic) were utilized. McNemar tests evaluated the performance of neuropsychological-actuarial versus clinical-consensus criteria in those who remained stable or converted to dementia over 3 annual visits, stratified by ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic). Chi-square analysis was used to compare frequencies of APOE ε4 allele positivity by diagnostic method. Results: Significantly more Hispanic participants were diagnosed with MCI using neuropsychological-actuarial criteria than were non-Hispanics, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 195.3, p &lt; .001, ϕ = 0.32. Hispanic participants meeting neuropsychological-actuarial MCI criteria at baseline were more likely to revert at follow-up, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 10.04, p &lt; .01, ϕ = 0.10. No differences in reversion rate were found between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals with clinical-consensus MCI diagnoses, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.38, p = .60. There was no association between APOE ε4 allele positivity and neuropsychological-actuarial diagnosis, while there was an association for clinical-consensus diagnoses χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 15.1, p &lt; .001, ϕ = 0.09. Conclusions: In TARCC, the clinical-consensus MCI diagnostic method produced fewer cases of reversion compared to the neuropsychological-actuarial method, particularly in Hispanic participants. This is consistent with recent research investigating the use of the neuropsychological-actuarial method in African American/Black individuals. Caution is warranted when using neuropsychological-actuarial criteria among individuals with diverse backgrounds.",Clin Neuropsychol
40096060,Local genetic covariance analysis with lipid traits identifies novel loci for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"The genetic component of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), accounting for ~10% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, is largely unexplained. Recent studies suggest that EOAD may be enriched for variants acting in the lipid pathway. The current study examines the shared genetic heritability between EOAD and the lipid pathway using genome-wide multi-trait genetic covariance analyses. Summary statistics were obtained from the GWAS meta-analyses of EOAD by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (n=19,668) and five blood lipid traits by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (n=1,320,016). The significant results were compared between the EOAD and lipids GWAS and genetic covariance analyses were performed via SUPERGNOVA. Genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with top EOAD hits in identified regions of covariance with lipid traits were scored and ranked for causality by combining evidence from gene-based analysis, AD-risk scores incorporating transcriptomic and proteomic evidence, eQTL data, eQTL colocalization analyses, DNA methylation data, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Direct comparison of GWAS results showed 5 loci overlapping between EOAD and at least one lipid trait harboring APOE, TREM2, MS4A4E, LILRA5, and LRRC25. Local genetic covariance analyses identified 3 regions of covariance between EOAD and at least one lipid trait. Gene prioritization nominated 3 likely causative genes at these loci: ANKDD1B, CUZD1, and MS4A64.The current study identified genetic covariance between EOAD and lipids, providing further evidence of shared genetic architecture and mechanistic pathways between the two traits.",PLoS Genet
39994987,Transcranial electrical stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease: Current uses and challenges.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently rarely effective drug treatments available to halt or slow down its progression. With the aging of the world population, AD as the primary cause of dementia, is rapidly becoming one of the most expensive, lethal, and burdening diseases of this century. In recent years, the new method used to treat nervous system diseases including AD is transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) with non-invasive and for regulating the flexibility of neural circuits operation and behaviors. The rationale of tES for AD neuromodulation is derived from research on animal and clinical trials. In the present paper, we review the current uses of the tES including transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, and transcranial pulsed electrical stimulation in rehabilitation for AD's core clinical symptom with cognitive dysfunctions, as well as the relevant data from AD animal models have also been discussed. Finally, the regarding applied challenges of tES in AD therapy have been referred for further improvement.",J Alzheimers Dis

40110658,The impact of arteriolosclerosis on cognitive impairment in decedents without severe dementia from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), Lewy body disease (LBD), and vascular neuropathologies occur together. Previous studies have been limited by a large majority of participants with severe dementia or advanced stages of pathologies, which limits the detectability of cognitive effects from vascular neuropathologies.
METHODS: Using neuropathology data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we examined the association of vascular neuropathologies with cognitive scores in participants without severe dementia (N = 1526) using multivariable linear regression.
RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, education, LBD, and ADNC, arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower memory (β = -0.16 ± 0.06, p < 0.001), executive function (β = -0.25 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), and language scores (β = -0.20 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The effects of arteriolosclerosis remained when controlling for vascular risk factors.
DISCUSSION: Vascular neuropathologies exhibit distinct relationships with cognition. Arteriolosclerosis is an independent contributor to cognition. Further research should be conducted on whether arteriolosclerosis can serve as a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in early disease stages.
HIGHLIGHTS: In individuals who do not have severe dementia, vascular neuropathologies are common, and the combination of pathologies is heterogeneous in a convenience sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center that reported all the neuropathology data elements for this investigation. Arteriolosclerosis is associated with several cognitive domain scores, including memory, executive function, and language when controlling for the effects of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change and Lewy body disease. These results reinforce the importance of vascular pathology for cognition among people along the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.",Alzheimers Dement
39982692,Neuropsychology of Alzheimer's disease: From preclinical phase to dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by significant cognitive and functional decline, initially presenting with episodic memory impairment. A thorough neuropsychological assessment is essential for AD diagnosis, particularly in the early stages in which interventions may be more effective. This paper reviews the neuropsychology of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the cognitive progression of the disease. In the typical forms of AD, episodic memory appears to be the first and foremost affected cognitive domain. As AD progresses, cognitive impairments extend beyond memory to affect various domains such as attention, executive functions, language, and visuospatial abilities. Neuropsychiatric issues, such as depression and anxiety, which often accompany cognitive decline, are also common, especially at the advanced stages of the disease. While episodic memory impairment is the earliest and most prominent feature in typical AD cases, comprehensive assessments, including social cognition and neuropsychiatric evaluations, are crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.",Appl Neuropsychol Adult
40013094,Functional and effective EEG connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be best conceptualized as a disconnection syndrome, such that symptoms may be largely attributable to disrupted communication between brain regions, rather than to deterioration within discrete systems. EEG is uniquely capable of directly and non-invasively measuring neural activity with precise temporal resolution; connectivity quantifies the relationships between such signals in different brain regions. EEG research on connectivity in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often considered a prodromal phase of AD, has produced mixed results and has yet to be synthesized for comprehensive review. Thus, we performed a systematic review of EEG connectivity in MCI and AD participants compared with cognitively healthy older adult controls.
METHODS: We searched PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies in English on EEG, connectivity, and MCI/AD relative to controls. Of 1,344 initial matches, 124 articles were ultimately included in the systematic review.
RESULTS: The included studies primarily analyzed coherence, phase-locked, and graph theory metrics. The influence of factors such as demographics, design, and approach was integrated and discussed. An overarching pattern emerged of lower connectivity in both MCI and AD compared to healthy controls, which was most prominent in the alpha band, and most consistent in AD. In the minority of studies reporting greater connectivity, theta band was most commonly implicated in both AD and MCI, followed by alpha. The overall prevalence of alpha effects may indicate its potential to provide insight into nuanced changes associated with AD-related networks, with the caveat that most studies were during the resting state where alpha is the dominant frequency. When greater connectivity was reported in MCI, it was primarily during task engagement, suggesting compensatory resources may be employed. In AD, greater connectivity was most common during rest, suggesting compensatory resources during task engagement may already be exhausted.
CONCLUSION: The review highlighted EEG connectivity as a powerful tool to advance understanding of AD-related changes in brain communication. We address the need for including demographic and methodological details, using source space connectivity, and extending this work to cognitively healthy older adults with AD risk toward advancing early AD detection and intervention.",Front Aging Neurosci

Linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the association of CSF ApoE and C1q. The mediation model and structural equation model (SEM) were conducted to explore the associations of ApoE and C1q with AD biomarkers.ResultsMultiple linear regression showed that CSF ApoE was positively associated with CSF C1q in total participants and Alzheimer's continuum participants. Mediation analyses indicated that C1q mediated the associations of CSF ApoE with CSF T-tau, P-tau, sTREM2 and GFAP (mediation proportions range from 15.06 to 44.64%; all the p values < 0.05) but not with CSF amyloid-β and progranulin (PGRN). The SEM yielded similar results.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that C1q is linked to ApoE, and it mediates the associations of ApoE with T-tau, P-tau, sTREM2, GFAP, indicating C1q association with ApoE might be involved in AD progression.",J Alzheimers Dis
40108015,Mapping the impact of age and APOE risk factors for late onset Alzheimer's disease on long range brain connections through multiscale bundle analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease currently has no cure and is usually detected too late for interventions to be effective. In this study we have focused on cognitively normal subjects to study the impact of risk factors on their long-range brain connections. To detect vulnerable connections, we devised a multiscale, hierarchical method for spatial clustering of the whole brain tractogram and examined the impact of age and APOE allelic variation on cognitive abilities and bundle properties including texture e.g., mean fractional anisotropy, variability, and geometric properties including streamline length, volume, shape, as well as asymmetry. We found that the third level subdivision in the bundle hierarchy provided the most sensitive ability to detect age and genotype differences associated with risk factors. Our results indicate that frontal bundles were a major age predictor, while the occipital cortex and cerebellar connections were important risk predictors that were heavily genotype dependent, and showed accelerated decline in fractional anisotropy, shape similarity, and increased asymmetry. Cognitive metrics related to olfactory memory were mapped to bundles, providing possible early markers of neurodegeneration. In addition, physiological metrics associated with cardiovascular disease risk were associated with changes in white matter tracts. Our novel method for a data driven analysis of sensitive changes in tractography may differentiate populations at risk for AD and isolate specific vulnerable networks.",Brain Struct Funct
40098612,The multiple biological activities of hyperoside: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutic perspectives in neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases.,"In recent years, hyperoside (quercetin 3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside) has garnered significant attention due to its diverse biological effects, which include vasoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. Notably, hyperoside has shown remarkable potential in cancer therapy by targeting multiple mechanisms; it induces apoptosis, inhibits proliferation, blocks angiogenesis, and reduces the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Furthermore, hyperoside enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy by modulating key signaling pathways. Beyond neoplastic diseases, hyperoside also presents promising therapeutic applications in managing non-cancerous conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. This review comprehensively examines the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperoside's anti-cancer effects and highlights its role in the treatment of cancers, including lung and colorectal cancers. Additionally, it explores the latest research on hyperoside's potential in addressing non-neoplastic conditions, such as pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. By summarizing current findings, this review underscores the unique therapeutic value of hyperoside and its potential as a multifunctional treatment in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic contexts.",Front Pharmacol
40021093,Cognitive resilience in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanism and potential clinical intervention.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally recognized neurodegenerative disorder that severely impairs cognitive function and imposes substantial psychological and financial burdens on patients and their families. The hallmark pathological features of AD include progressive neurodegeneration, extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque accumulation, and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein tangles. However, recent studies have identified a subset of patients exhibiting cognitive resilience, characterized by a slower cognitive decline or the preservation of high cognitive function despite the presence of AD pathology. Cognitive resilience is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. In addition, cognitive resilience contributes to the new perspectives on the diagnosis and personalized treatment of AD. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of current studies on cognitive resilience in AD and to explore future research directions of AD diagnosis and treatment.",Ageing Res Rev
39992888,Indole-3-Propionic Acid Attenuates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Deficits by Inhibiting the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 Signaling Pathway.,"Cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are highly prevalent and place heavy burdens on society. Neuroinflammation is a driver of cognitive impairment, with no effective drugs. Indole 3-propionic acid (IPA) is a tryptophan metabolite mainly produced byClostridium sporogenes, which exhibits multiple functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties. However, the restorative effects and molecular mechanisms of IPA in cognitive impairment remain to be investigated. In this study, we found that IPA reduced LPS-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage in HT22 cells and decreased LPS-induced inflammation in BV2 cells. Besides, IPA promoted neurogenesis, inhibited glial cell activation, maintained the integrity of the BBB and intestinal barrier, and remodeled the gut microbiota, thereby alleviating memory impairment in LPS-induced cognitively impaired mice. At the mechanistic level, IPA inhibited the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway and thus ameliorated neuroinflammation. Interestingly, Colivelin TFA, an activator of JAK2-STAT3 signaling, partially reversed the neurorestorative effects of IPA. In conclusion, IPA ameliorates neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits via the inhibition of the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Thus, IPA may be a potential drug for the treatment of cognitive disorders.",J Agric Food Chem
40064559,Opposite causal effects of type 2 diabetes and metformin on Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is commonly co-morbid with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether T2D itself or the antidiabetic drug metformin contributes to the progression of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the overall and independent effects of T2D and metformin use on the risk of AD.
METHODS: Summary genome-wide association study datasets were utilized for the Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses, including ones for T2D (N = 455,017), metformin (N = 456,276), and AD (N = 453,733). Additionally, using the proportional imbalance method, we analyzed AD-related adverse drug events in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database (covering Q1 2004 to Q2 2024).
RESULTS: Our two-sample MR analysis indicated that T2D is not associated with the risk of AD (OR: 1.03, CI: 0.99-1.08, P = 0.128). However, while not statistically significant, genetic signature for metformin exposure demonstrated a trend toward an increased risk of AD (OR: 1.05, CI: 1.00-1.09, P = 0.053). Interestingly, in MVMR analysis, which evaluates independent effects of T2D and metformin exposure on T2D, we found a robust association of T2D with a decrease in the risk of AD (OR: 0.82, CI: 0.68-0.98, P = 0.031), while the use of metformin was associated with a higher risk of AD (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.06-1.50, P = 9.45E-3). In the FAERS database, a total of 228,283 metformin-related adverse event reports from 67,742 cases were found. For metformin as the target drug and AD as the target adverse event, signal analysis reported 29 cases of AD (ROR: 0.83, 95 % CI: 0.58-1.19, P = 0.3126).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the opposite independent causal effects of T2D and metformin exposure on AD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing AD risk when prescribing metformin to patients with T2D.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40133753,Advancements in Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras for Targeted Therapeutic Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins, which mislocalize and form neurofibrillary tangles, and the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These toxic protein aggregates contribute to synaptic impairment and neuronal dysfunction, underscoring the need for strategies aimed at effectively clearing or reducing these aggregates in the treatment of AD. In recent years, proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has emerged as a promising approach for selectively degrading dysfunctional proteins rather than merely inhibiting their function. This approach holds great potential for developing more effective interventions that could slow AD progression and improve patient outcomes. In this review, we first examine the pathological mechanisms underlying AD, focusing on abnormal protein degradation and accumulation. We then explore the evolution of PROTAC technology, its mechanisms of action, and the current status of drug development. Finally, we discuss the latest findings regarding the application of PROTACs in AD therapy, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of this technology. Although promising, further clinical research is necessary to fully assess the safety and efficacy of PROTAC-based therapies for AD treatment.",Mol Neurobiol
40104524,A Phase IIa clinical trial to evaluate the effects of anti-retroviral therapy in Alzheimer's disease (ART-AD).,"Retrotransposons constitute over 40% of the human genome. Studies in Drosophila, mice, cultured cells, and human brain show that retrotransposons are activated in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, and causally drive neurodegeneration. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3TC (lamivudine) reduces retrotransposon activation and suppresses tau neurotoxicity among model systems. This phase 2a open-label trial (Pilot Study to Investigate the Safety and Feasibility of Anti-Retroviral Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease, NCT04552795, registered 09/10/2020) followed 12 participants with early Alzheimer's disease (MMSE &gt; 24, CDR = 0.5) over 24 weeks to assess safety, tolerability, and feasibility of daily 300 mg 3TC treatment. The sample was well-educated (12-20 years) and culturally diverse (25% from underrepresented groups). In addition to a favorable safety profile and stable cognitive measures, notable significant changes in fluid-based biomarkers include reduction of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (P = 0.03) in CSF, suggestive of reduced neuroinflammation, and elevation of Aβ42/40 (P = 0.009) in plasma, suggestive of reduced plaque load in the brain. These results warrant further exploration in a larger, placebo-controlled trial.",NPJ Dement
40057150,Blocking the Dkk1-LRP6 interaction prevents acute amyloid-β-driven cognitive impairment.,"Synapse loss driven by amyloid-β (Aβ) is an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the mechanism by which Aβ drives synapse loss remain poorly understood data indicate that a disruption of Wnt signalling plays an important part. We have shown that Aβ exerts its effects on synapses through Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), a secreted protein that acts upon Wnt signalling via a direct interaction with the canonical Wnt pathway co-receptor proteins, LRP5 and LRP6, preventing their interaction with the receptor Frizzled. This antagonises canonical, Wnt/β-catenin, signalling and allows concomitant activation of non-canonical signalling pathways. We contend that it is the switch from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signalling activity that drives synapse loss and subsequent cognitive impairment in AD, driven by Aβ and mediated by Dkk1. Preventing the Dkk1-LRP5/6 interaction could protect synapses and cognition against Aβ by maintaining canonical Wnt signalling. To test this, we mapped the Dkk1-LRP6 interaction by peptide array and identified a small peptide able to disrupt the Dkk1-LRP6 interaction. This Dkk1-LRP6 'disruptor' peptide dose dependently restores canonical Wnt signalling in the presence of Dkk1; blocks Dkk1-driven dendritic spine loss in primary rat cortical cultures and the accompanying increase in endogenous Aβ production; and when administered intracerebroventricularly to a rat acute Aβ model, blocks Aβ-driven cognitive impairment. These data support our contention that the ability of Aβ to induce Dkk1 and the effects of Dkk1 on LRP6 are an important element in AD aetiopathology and establish Dkk1 as a therapeutic target for protecting synapse and cognition in AD.",Cell Signal
40140948,Neuronal CD47 induces behavioral alterations and ameliorates microglial synaptic pruning in wild-type and Alzheimer's mouse models.,"BACKGROUND: Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that play a crucial role in synapse pruning during the development and progression of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mechanistically, CD47 protein acts as a potent 'do not eat me' signal, protecting synapses from phagocytosis by microglia. However, the functional role of the upregulated neuronal CD47 signal under both physiological and pathological conditions remains unclear.
RESULTS: We utilized an adeno-associated virus gene expression system to induce neuron-specific overexpression of CD47 in wild-type and 5xFAD mice, assessing its effects on microglial synaptic phagocytosis and mouse behaviors. Our results indicate that neuronal CD47 induces ASD-like behaviors and synaptic pruning defects, while promoting behavioral disinhibition and improving memory in wild-type mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was employed to profile gene expression patterns in subpopulations of neurons and microglia. Notably, neuronal CD47 enhances synaptic pathways in neurons and particularly shifts microglial subpopulations from a disease-associated state to a homeostatic state. Additionally, neuronal CD47 reduces excessive microglial synaptic phagocytosis induced by Aβ pathology in 5xFAD mice.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that neuronal CD47 overexpression results in synaptic pruning defects and is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD, while also playing a beneficial role in mitigating excessive synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease.",Cell Biosci
40051819,Early detection of Alzheimer's disease using the MEMORIES mnemonic.,"The rising incidence and death rates linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlight an urgent issue. Genetic screening is celebrated as a significant advancement for its early detection capabilities, pinpointing those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. Yet, the limited availability of these technologies highlights a critical gap in widespread application. This review pivots to the potential of presymptomatic clinical assessments as a readily available, economical, and simple strategy for early detection. Traditionally, AD diagnosis relies on the late-stage identification of cognitive deterioration, functional impairments, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, coinciding with advanced brain degeneration. Conversely, emerging research identifies early indicators preceding significant degeneration, manifesting years before clinical symptoms. We introduce a mnemonic, MEMORIES, to categorize these prodromal: Metabolism changes, Eye/visual impairments, March (refer to gait disturbances), Olfactory dysfunction, Rhythm (blood pressure and heart rate), Insensitivity of the tongue, Ears (hearing loss), and Stool alterations. Recognizing these prodromal through clinical examinations provides a valuable strategy for initiating preventative actions against brain degeneration. This approach advocates for broadening the screening lens beyond genetic screening to encompass clinical evaluations, enhancing early detection and intervention opportunities for AD.",Chronic Dis Transl Med
40103931,Sex-related differences in genetically determined Alzheimer's disease.,"We reviewed the literature on sex differences in genetically determined Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), Down syndrome-associated AD (DSAD), and APOE4 homozygosity, particularly regarding disease penetrance, symptom onset and clinical progression, and trajectories for markers of amyloidosis (A), tau pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N). Data suggests that sex differences in disease penetrance, symptom onset, and AT(N) biomarker trajectories are typically subtle for genetically determined AD populations. Noteworthy exceptions, such as increased neurodegeneration in later stages of the disease in females while similar cognitive outcomes, suggest a potential differential cognitive reserve that warrants further investigation. Additionally, the interaction between APOE genotype and sex reveals complex and multifaceted effects in DSAD, with potential implications for ADAD that remain underexplored. The smaller sex differences observed compared to sporadic AD offer insights into the different underlying disease mechanisms in genetically determined AD populations. Future research should prioritize sex-specific investigations in genetically determined AD, focusing on refining methodologies. This includes prioritizing longitudinal designs, adjustment for key confounders, and adherence to sex-specific guidelines.",Front Aging Neurosci
40133772,Temporal-multimodal consistency alignment for Alzheimer's cognitive assessment prediction.,"BACKGROUND: As one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely impacts human thinking and behavior. Early and accurate prediction of cognitive decline is crucial for timely AD intervention. However, most existing prognostic methods hardly explore the underlying association among longitudinal data from different modalities in disease progression, thus the predictive ability of current models is still quite limited.
PURPOSE: We propose the unifying Multi-Modality fusion with DUal-gRanularity Alignment framework (MM-DURA) to simultaneously model longitudinal correlations and modalities interactions for cognitive assessment forecasting. Our proposed framework leverages temporal MRI scans, time-aligned clinical diagnostics, and genomic data as inputs to forecast multiple cognitive assessment scores.
METHODS: We propose a novel coarse-to-fine feature representation learning approach to ascertain the congruence between modalities at both the subject and visit granularities. This method ensures the alignment of multimodal data pertaining to individual subjects and captures the temporal progression of these modalities. Additionally, we design a hierarchical multimodality fusion (HMF) block that can effectively exploit the interrelationships and dependencies among modalities. Lastly, we employ an LSTM-based regression head with the fused multimodality embedding as input to forecast the future status of cognitive ability.
RESULTS: We validate our method on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and investigate the optimal hierarchical structure for modality fusion. The whole dataset includes 707 subjects participating in the ADNI1, ADNIGO, and ADNI2 studies. All subjects underwent longitudinal examinations with an average study period of approximately 14 months. The subject-level split for training, validation, and testing sets is 0.75:0.05:0.20. The proposed MM-DURA framework demonstrates superior performance, achieving remarkable RMSE values of 1.099 for CDRSB, 5.601 for ADAS-Cog, 2.051 for MMSE, 6.504 for RAVLT, and 3.447 for FAQ cognitive assessments forecasting. These results outperform all six comparison methods, including two state-of-the-art multimodal temporal modeling approaches. Comprehensive ablation experimental results affirm the effectiveness of longitudinal modeling with temporal-multimodal alignment, highlighting its clinical potential for cognitive assessment prediction. Visualizations of key brain regions and SNP significance analysis also provide substantial interpretability.
CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we proposed a novel framework that unifies multimodality fusion with dual-granularity alignment for cognitive assessment forecasting. Our approach utilizes a temporal-multimodal consistency alignment strategy, which effectively synchronizes various modalities within a unified latent space. Furthermore, the innovative HMF block we developed capitalizes on the inherent relationships and dependencies between modalities to optimize data integration. Extensive numerical results on five cognitive assessment scores, supported by detailed visualizations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods.

40087672,Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and its estimation with fluid and imaging biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by the extracellular deposition of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and the intraneuronal accumulation of abnormal phosphorylated tau (τ)-protein (p-τ). Most frequently, these hallmark lesions are accompanied by other co-pathologies in the brain that may contribute to cognitive impairment, such as vascular lesions, intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated transactive-response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and/or α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. To estimate the extent of these AD and co-pathologies in patients, several biomarkers have been developed. Specific tracers target and visualize Aβ plaques, p-τ and αSyn pathology or inflammation by positron emission tomography. In addition to these imaging biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-based biomarker assays reflecting AD-specific or non-specific processes are either already in clinical use or in development. In this review, we will introduce the pathological lesions of the AD brain, the related biomarkers, and discuss to what extent the respective biomarkers estimate the pathology determined at post-mortem histopathological analysis. It became evident that initial stages of Aβ plaque and p-τ pathology are not detected with the currently available biomarkers. Interestingly, p-τ pathology precedes Aβ deposition, especially in the beginning of the disease when biomarkers are unable to detect it. Later, Aβ takes the lead and accelerates p-τ pathology, fitting well with the known evolution of biomarker measures over time. Some co-pathologies still lack clinically established biomarkers today, such as TDP-43 pathology or cortical microinfarcts. In summary, specific biomarkers for AD-related pathologies allow accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on pathobiological parameters. Although current biomarkers are excellent measures for the respective pathologies, they fail to detect initial stages of the disease for which post-mortem analysis of the brain is still required. Accordingly, neuropathological studies remain essential to understand disease development especially in early stages. Moreover, there is an urgent need for biomarkers reflecting co-pathologies, such as limbic predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy-related pathology, which is known to modify the disease by interacting with p-τ. Novel biomarker approaches such as extracellular vesicle-based assays and cryptic RNA/peptides may help to better detect these co-pathologies in the future.",Mol Neurodegener
40145329,Updates and future perspectives on neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum and profoundly affect patients, caregivers, and health-care systems. This review synthesizes key research presented in the 2022 and 2023 Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Neuropsychiatric Syndromes-Professional Interest Area (NPS-PIA) Year-In-Reviews, emphasizing six critical areas: (1) diversity and disparities, (2) diagnostic frameworks, (3) neurobiology of NPS, (4) NPS as a disease marker, (5) the impact of COVID-19, and (6) interventions. NPS accelerates AD progression, increases functional decline, diminishes quality of life, and heightens caregiver burden and institutionalization rates. Current treatments primarily rely on psychotropics, which offer limited efficacy and raise safety concerns. This review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about recent NPS advancements while identifying gaps for future studies to improve outcomes for individuals with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Research in Alzheimer's disease-related neuropsychiatric symptoms has rapidly increased, indicating heightened interest. Key areas include: diversity, diagnostics, markers, COVID-19 impact, and treatments. A road map for future studies, based on the key areas of research, is provided. This road map includes considerations to improve study applicability and validity.",Alzheimers Dement
40113024,The value of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein as a biomarker of astrogliosis in different neurological diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) is a well-established biomarker of astrocytes and astrogliosis, a pathological response observed in various neurological diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of serum GFAP in Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) polyneuropathy.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study, including 498 participants (337 healthy controls and 161 patients with AD, MS, or ATTR amyloidosis). Serum GFAP levels were measured using the Lumipulse G1200 platform, and statistical analyses were performed to compare levels across disease groups and assess their diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: GFAP levels were significantly elevated in all neurological disease groups compared to age-matched controls, with the highest levels found in AD (79.4 pg/mL vs. 39.5 pg/mL, p = 2.55 × 10<sup>-12</sup>). ROC curve analysis revealed that GFAP had strong diagnostic performance for AD (AUC = 0.86), moderate performance for ATTR amyloidosis (AUC = 0.67), and poor performance for MS (AUC = 0.61).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that GFAP is a promising biomarker for AD, reflecting astrocytic activation and neuroinflammatory processes. Its diagnostic utility in ATTR amyloidosis is moderate, while its role in MS remains limited.",Clin Chim Acta
39996037,The antioxidant potential of bacoside and its derivatives in Alzheimer's disease: The molecular mechanistic paths and therapeutic prospects.,"Central nervous system disorders are likely to have a substantial effect on the worldwide healthcare demands of humanity in this era. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a senile decay of neurons. Extracellular beta-amyloid accumulation and intracellular tau hyperphosphorylation are two key characteristics of the pathogenesis of AD. Because of the multifactorial character of many disorders, new medicine-based psychoactive treatments have had limited success. As a result, there is a growing demand for innovative products that can target different receptors and improve behavioral abilities on their own or in combination with established treatments. In recent years, both industrialized and developing countries have seen a surge in herbal products based on traditional knowledge. According to recent research, bacoside and its congeners can dramatically lower the build-up of amyloid-β plaques, which are a defining feature of AD. This decrease is explained by bacoside's capacity to regulate β-secretase activity, which lowers the production of amyloid-β. Ayurveda is a medical science that focuses on the use of naturally occurring plant products to treat ailments. Many neuroprotective plants are said to be found in Ayurveda. The key physiological dysfunctions linked to tau aggregates, which contribute to dementia and behavioral inconsistencies, include the formation of reactive oxygen species, augmented neuronal swelling, and neurotoxicity. Here, we have focused on bacopa as an anti-Alzheimer medication. Bacoside A, Baccoside B, Apigenin, Betullinic acid, etc. are the pharmacologically active congeners of Brahmi belonging to several chemical families. In this review, the neuroprotective properties, pharmacological effectiveness, and molecular mechanism of bacoside scaffolds against AD have been discussed.",Toxicol Rep
40034098,Diffusion tensor subspace imaging of double diffusion-encoded MRI delineates small fibers and gray-matter microstructure not visible with single encoding techniques.,"PURPOSE: Double diffusion encoding (DDE) acquisition strategies promise specificity for small-dimensional structures inaccessible to single diffusion encoding (SDE). For DDE-weighted MRI scans to become relevant for whole brain imaging, signal reconstruction frameworks must accurately report microstructural features of interest-especially microscale anisotropy in complex tissue environments. This study examined the recently developed diffusion tensor subspace imaging (DiTSI) framework and its radial and spherical anisotropy metrics (RA and SA, respectively) in postmortem human brain tissue specimens.
METHODS: MRI microscopy including multishell SDE-weighted and DDE-weighted imaging was performed for healthy brain stem and temporal lobe specimens and for specimens with Alzheimer's disease pathology and neurodegeneration. The DiTSI framework was compared with four other diffusion MRI frameworks, and angular and radial DDE sampling were evaluated.
RESULTS: DDE acquisition and the DiTSI metric maps of SA and RA in temporal lobe and brain-stem specimens were found to be distinct from fractional anisotropy and orientation dispersion index in providing complementary and selective contrast of microscale anisotropy at the gray-matter/white-matter interface in the cortex and in hippocampal layers. DiTSI maps also unmasked small fascicles in the brain stem that were not detectable by SDE techniques and provided selective contrast across the major fiber pathways. Results also revealed prominent reductions of SA and RA in tissue with Alzheimer's disease pathology that were not observed for any other framework.
CONCLUSIONS: New contrasts were evident for DiTSI framework metrics over a range of tissue environments with promise toward providing novel markers of pathology.",Magn Reson Med
40045203,A genome-wide association study identifies a novel East Asian-specific locus for dementia with Lewy bodies in Japanese subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of degenerative dementia in older patients. As with other multifactorial diseases, the pathogenesis results from interactions of environmental and genetic factors. The genetic basis of DLB is not yet fully understood. Recent genomic analyses of DLB in Caucasian cohorts identified genetic susceptibility loci for DLB, but the comprehensive genomic analysis in Asians was still not performed.
METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Japanese subjects (211 DLB cases and 6113 controls) to clarify the genetic architecture of DLB pathogenesis.
RESULTS: We identified the East Asian-specific DHTKD1 locus (rs138587229) on chromosome 10 with genome-wide significance (GWS; P = 3.27 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and the ICOS/PARD3B locus on chromosome 2 with suggestive significance (P = 3.95 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) as novel DLB genetic risk loci. We also confirmed the APOE locus (rs429358, P &lt; 5.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), a known risk locus for DLB and Alzheimer's disease in Caucasians. The DHTKD1 locus was associated with the gene expression of SEC61A2 and showed a causal relationship with cholinesterase levels. In a trans-ethnic meta-analysis that included Japanese, UK Biobank, and other Caucasian GWAS, we confirmed the risk for DLB at APOE and SNCA loci with GWS. Transcriptome-wide association analysis identified ZNF155 and ZNF284 in the brain cortex and GPRIN3 in the substantia nigra as putative causal genes for DLB.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first GWAS for DLB in East Asians, and our findings provide new biological and clinical insights into the pathogenesis of DLB.",Mol Med
39978523,Discovery of effective GSK-3β inhibitors as therapeutic potential against Alzheimer's disease: A computational drug design insight.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mostly thought to be caused by overactivity of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β). Therefore, a GSK-3β inhibitor may be a suggested medicine for Alzheimer's therapy. Nowadays, computational techniques are thought to be among the quickest and most affordable options for therapeutic design and drug discovery. Following a preliminary screening of flavonoids for possible protection against cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's, Amentoflavone, Curcumin, and Notopterol were shown to be promising candidates. Using molecular docking, the ligand orientation and binding energy in the ATP-binding pocket of GSK-3β were ascertained. Amentoflavone formed a hydrogen bond with the GSK-3β protein's ATP binding site during the molecular docking phase, obtaining the highest negative binding energy. However, when the results moved closer to a molecular dynamics simulation, the findings changed, and Curcumin was shown to be the most potent inhibitor. All structures remained stable during the MD simulation of the GSK-3β protein and its ligands. Moreover, compared to other natural compounds, Curcumin showed higher binding free energy. Therefore, Curcumin may be useful as a polyphenolic flavonoid in the prevention and treatment of AD. Hence, additional research in vitro and in vivo can focus on these flavonoid compounds as an alternative treatment.",Int J Biol Macromol
39993207,Deep learning to quantify the pace of brain aging in relation to neurocognitive changes.,"Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P, however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood-brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM's ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals' rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
40057281,Role of dopaminergic RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) in manganese-induced behavioral deficits and dysregulating dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in mice.,"Chronic exposure to elevated levels of manganese (Mn) induces manganism, a neurological disorder, exhibiting symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease (PD). Mn is well known to dysregulate dopaminergic (DAergic) function, while the repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) induces protection against Mn-induced toxicity and several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated if DAergic REST plays a role in Mn-induced neurotoxicity by assessing behavioral deficits and alteration of neurotransmitter levels using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), and microdialysis between DAergic-specific REST-deleted (REST cKO) mice and REST loxP mice as wild-type (WT) controls. Mice were exposed to Mn (330 μg, daily intranasal instillation for 3 weeks), followed by assessment of locomotor activity and novel object recognition, and subsequent brain dissection. Neurotransmitters, including DA, serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and glutamate, were analyzed in different brain regions, such as the striatum, midbrain, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. After Mn exposure, extracellular DA levels in the striatum were measured by HPLC-microdialysis. The results showed that DAergic REST deletion exacerbated Mn-induced behavioral deficits and decreased DA levels in the nigrostriatal regions of WT mice. REST cKO increased DA turnover rates (DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA) by 10-fold in the nigrostriatal regions, showing lesser effects in other brain regions. Mn decreased extracellular DA levels, as measured by microdialysis, in the striatum in both genotypes. Mn decreased cortical NE levels in both genotypes and further exacerbated in REST cKO, while Mn decreased nigrostriatal NE levels only in REST cKO mice. REST cKO reduced 5-HT levels in all brain regions tested compared to WT mice. Mn increased glutamate and GABA levels in the striatum and midbrain, while these Mn effects were not altered by REST cKO. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that DAergic REST deficiency exacerbates Mn-induced motor and cognitive deficits along with dysregulation of neurotransmitters, mainly DA, 5-HT, and NE, suggesting that DAergic REST is important in Mn-induced dysregulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission.",Neurotoxicology
39992249,The role of insulin resistance and APOE genotype on blood-brain barrier integrity in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence suggests a connection between insulin resistance and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but the mechanisms are unclear. We examined effects of insulin resistance and APOE genotype on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in AD.
METHODS: BBB integrity was measured in 196 biologically-confirmed non-diabetic patients with AD evaluating CSF/serum albumin ratio, kappa and lambda free light chains (FLCs). Insulin resistance was assessed using triglyceride-glucose index (TyG). The impact of TyG on BBB integrity, and its interaction with APOE genotypes, was analyzed using multivariate models.
RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of patients with AD showed altered TyG, with the 21.8% classified as high TyG. TyG subgroups were associated with BBB abnormalities, with similar AD clinical and biomarkers profile. A significant interaction between TyG and APOE ε4/ε4 genotype on BBB permeability was found in multivariate analyses.
DISCUSSION: Insulin resistance is a common feature in non-diabetic AD and correlates with altered BBB permeability, interacting synergistically with APOE genotype.
HIGHLIGHTS: Insulin resistance and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype are well-recognized risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin resistance shows high prevalence in patients with AD. Insulin resistance is related to damage in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. The association between the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and BBB permeability varies in relation to APOE genotype; patients with the APOE ε4/ε4 displayed higher BBB permeability.",Alzheimers Dement
40057102,A comprehensive approach to anticipating the progression of mild cognitive impairment.,"The immersive experience provided by our approach empowers researchers with an intuitive exploration of brain structures. Within the brain's central nervous system, encompassing both white and gray matter, symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often manifest through gray matter decline. The manual identification of these changes proves to be a time-intensive endeavor. Although learning-based systems can detect such changes, their implementation requires substantial computational resources and extensive datasets. To surmount these challenges, we present a tailored framework designed for the categorization of distinct AD stages through brain image tissue segmentation. Our innovative approach seamlessly integrates transfer learning and fine-tuning of frozen layers and employs models such as VGG16, VGG19, AlexNet, and ResNet50. This comprehensive strategy significantly amplifies simulation outcomes across five AD categories, contributing to an overall enhancement in model efficacy. In the initial stages, our model undergoes fine-tuning to predict various AD stages, and the integration of data augmentation techniques further refines its performance. Our study culminates with the assertion that a pre-trained model, characterized by deep connectivity of dense layers, additional layers, and frozen blocks, adeptly addresses the challenges intrinsic to the proposed multiclass classification. Experimental results conclusively endorse the superior accuracy achieved through the implementation of our proposed strategy.",Brain Res
40034682,Endothelial progenitor cells and cerebral small vessel disease in APOE4 carriers.,"APOE4 carriers at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease exhibit early cerebrovascular dysfunction, which may be triggered by endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) represent cell populations involved in promoting angiogenesis and facilitating vascular repair in response to injury. We examined whether elevated EPCs are associated with lower cerebral small vessel disease burden in APOE4 carriers prior to cognitive decline. Independently living older adults (N = 109, mean age = 70.5 years; SD = 7.9; 34.9 % male) free of dementia or clinical stroke underwent brain MRI and venipuncture. Small vessel disease was determined using a validated scale. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume was determined using the lesion segmentation toolbox. PBMCs were cultured and EPCs were defined as number of colony forming units in vitro. Regression analysis revealed an association between average number of EPC colonies and lower small vessel disease load (p = .026) and WMH volume (p = .002), in APOE4 carriers. Findings suggest that EPC colony count may indicate activation of mechanisms which protect cerebrovascular function in APOE4 carriers prior to the development of cognitive decline.",Cereb Circ Cogn Behav
40141072,Comparison of Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning Models for Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Plasma Proteomic Biomarkers.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical condition characterized by a decline in cognitive ability and progression of cognitive impairment. It is often considered a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to compare deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) methods in predicting MCI using plasma proteomic biomarkers. A total of 239 adults were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort along with a pool of 146 plasma proteomic biomarkers. We evaluated seven traditional ML models (support vector machines (SVMs), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) and six variations of a deep neural network (DNN) model-the DL model in the H2O package. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) selected 35 proteomic biomarkers from the pool. Based on grid search, the DNN model with an activation function of ""Rectifier With Dropout"" with 2 layers and 32 of 35 selected proteomic biomarkers revealed the best model with the highest accuracy of 0.995 and an F1 Score of 0.996, while among seven traditional ML methods, XGBoost was the best with an accuracy of 0.986 and an F1 Score of 0.985. Several biomarkers were correlated with the APOE-ε4 genotype, polygenic hazard score (PHS), and three clinical cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Aβ42, tTau, and pTau). Bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed several molecular functions and pathways associated with the selected biomarkers, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cholesterol metabolism, and regulation of lipid localization. The results showed that the DL model may represent a promising tool in the prediction of MCI. These plasma proteomic biomarkers may help with early diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, and early treatment interventions for individuals at risk for MCI.",Int J Mol Sci
40126601,HDAC3 as an Emerging Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease and other Neurological Disorders.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aged population. Histone acetylation is a major epigenetic mechanism linked to memory formation and cognitive function. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues in histone proteins. Although pan-HDAC inhibitors are effective in ameliorating AD phenotypes in preclinical models, they are associated with potential unfavorable adverse effects and barely translated into clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel HDAC inhibitors with a well isoform-selectivity has been desired in AD drug discovery. Among various HDAC isoforms, HDAC3 is highly expressed in neurons and exhibits detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Moreover, HDAC3 provokes neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity and contributes to AD pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight HDAC3 as an attractive therapeutic target for disease-modifying therapy in AD. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential of HDAC3 inhibitors in other neurological disorders.",Mol Neurobiol
40043125,Associations between hormone therapy use and tau accumulation in brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease.,"Elucidating the downstream impact of exogenous hormones on the aging brain will have far-reaching consequences for understanding why Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominates in women almost twofold over men. We tested the extent to which menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use is associated with later-life amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau accumulation using PET on N = 146 baseline clinically normal women, aged 51 to 89 years. Women were scanned over a 4.5-year (SD, 2.1; range, 1.3 to 10.4) and 3.5-year (SD, 1.5; range, 1.2 to 8.1) period for Aβ and tau, respectively, ~14 years after the initiation of HT. In older women (aged &gt;70 years), HT users exhibited faster regional tau accumulation relative to non-users, localized to the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, with an indirect effect of HT on cognitive decline through regional tau accumulation. In younger women (aged &lt;70 years), HT associations with tau accumulation were negligible. Findings are relevant for optimizing menopausal treatment guidelines.",Sci Adv
40030015,Inhibition of amyloid beta oligomer accumulation by NU-9: A unifying mechanism for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11, e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22, 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
40147639,"A novel selective phosphodiesterase 9 inhibitor, irsenontrine (E2027), enhances GluA1 phosphorylation in neurons and improves learning and memory via cyclic GMP elevation.","Phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9) plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function by modulating cyclic GMP (cGMP). Many reports have shown that PDE9 inhibition improves cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in rodents. Several studies have found that the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway is downregulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and in older individuals. A PDE9 inhibitor could therefore be a potential therapeutic approach for improving cognitive dysfunction in dementia, including in AD and DLB. We previously discovered a novel PDE9 inhibitor, irsenontrine (E2027). In the current study, irsenontrine showed highly selective affinity for PDE9 with more than 1,800-fold selectivity over other PDEs. Irsenontrine maleate significantly increased intracellular cGMP levels in rat cortical primary neurons, and phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 was induced following cGMP elevation. Oral administration of irsenontrine significantly upregulated cGMP levels in the hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of naïve rats, and a novel object recognition test showed that irsenontrine administration also significantly improved learning and memory. The effects of irsenontrine were confirmed in rats treated with Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), a model of learning and memory impairment due to downregulation of the cGMP pathway. L-NAME downregulated cGMP in the CSF and hippocampus and impaired novel object recognition, but oral administration of irsenontrine clearly attenuated these phenotypes. These results indicate that irsenontrine improves learning and memory via the elevation of cGMP levels, and they strongly suggest that irsenontrine could be a novel therapeutic approach against cognitive dysfunction.",Neuropharmacology
39998175,Mechanisms of comorbidity between Alzheimer's disease and pain.,"Clinical studies have revealed a significant correlation between pain and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, due to cognitive and speech impairments, AD patients, especially those in moderate to severe stages, are often overlooked in pain management. The challenges in obtaining pain-related information from this population exacerbate the issue. Although recent clinical research has increasingly recognized the comorbidity of AD and pain, the pathological alterations and interactive mechanisms underlying this relationship remain inadequately explored. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and pathological mechanisms of AD with and without pain comorbidity. It examines underlying processes, including neuroinflammation, peripheral-central immune interactions, and neurotransmitter dynamics. Furthermore, it highlights current pain assessment and management strategies in AD patients. By offering a theoretical framework, this review aims to support the development of effective pain management approaches and serve as a reference for clinical interventions targeting AD-associated pain. HIGHLIGHTS: The comorbidity between AD and CP encompasses multiple interrelated biological pathways, such as neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses. The damage to neurons and synapses in AD patients influences the brain regions responsible for processing pain, thereby reducing the pain response. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the development of both AD and CP. Enhanced inflammatory responses have an impact on the CNS and promote sensitization. Common neurotransmitter alterations exist in the comorbidity of AD and CP, influencing cognition, emotion, and pain perception.",Alzheimers Dement
40109301,Ganglioside lipids inhibit the aggregation of the Alzheimer's amyloid-β peptide.,"The aggregation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides (Aβ42/Aβ40) into amyloid fibrils and plaques is one of the molecular hallmarks in dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the molecular mechanisms behind this aggregation process are not fully known, it has been shown that some biomolecules can accelerate this process whereas others can inhibit amyloid formation. Lipids, which are ubiquitously found in cell membranes, play a pivotal role in protein aggregation. Here, we investigate how ganglioside lipids, which are abundant in the brain and in neurons, can influence the aggregation kinetics of both Aβ42 and Aβ40. We employ a variety of biophysical assays to characterise the effect ganglioside lipids have on the aggregation of Aβ. Through kinetic analysis, we show that the primary nucleation rate is greatly affected by the addition of gangliosides and that these lipids impair Aβ42 aggregation, while completely inhibiting Aβ40 aggregation. Furthermore, we find that an Aβ-ganglioside complex is formed, which potentially disrupts the aggregation pathway and results in delayed kinetics. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative description of how lipid molecules such as gangliosides can inhibit the aggregation of Aβ and shed light on the key factors that control these processes. In view of the fact that declining levels of gangliosides in neurons have been associated with ageing, our findings could be instrumental towards establishing new approaches in the prevention of amyloid-β aggregation.",RSC Chem Biol
40127100,Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 mediates presynaptic dysfunction induced by amyloid β oligomers.,"Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is initiated by oligomers of amyloid β peptide (Aβ<sub>o</sub>s). Treatments aimed at correcting synaptic dysfunction could be beneficial in preventing disease progression, but mechanisms underlying Aβ<sub>o</sub>-induced synaptic defects remain incompletely understood. Here, we uncover an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) - Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3 - protein kinase C (PKC) - glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signal transduction pathway that is engaged by Aβ<sub>o</sub>s to enhance presynaptic Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity, resulting in pathological potentiation of action-potential-evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism driving synaptic dysfunction in AD and identify multiple potentially tractable therapeutic targets.",Cell Rep
40034505,Lower expression of BIN1's neuronal isoform in vulnerable excitatory neurons increases risk in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience elevated DNA damage, with DNA repair sites enriched at enhancer regions of genes essential for neuronal survival. Excitatory neurons in the cortical superficial layers expressing CUX2 and RORB (Cux2+/Rorb+), are selectively vulnerable in AD, but their relationship to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and characterize functional AD-GWAS SNPs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing data, focusing on selectively vulnerable neurons and DNA repair hotspots.
METHODS: Filters were applied to identify candidate SNPs based on overlap with repair hotspots, RNA expression, transcription factor binding, AD association, and epigenetic significance. In vitro assays and analyses of large datasets from bulk RNA-seq (n = 1894), proteomics (n = 400), and single-nucleus RNA-seq (n = 424, 1.6 M cells) were conducted.
RESULTS: BIN1 SNP, rs78710909, met multiple criteria - located in an AD-GWAS locus, repair hotspot, and promoter region. rs78710909C exhibits 1.52× higher AD risk and 5.4× differential transcription factor binding. In vitro, rs78710909C shows greater enhancer activity and weaker p53 but stronger E2F1 binding. BIN1's neuronal isoform is neuroprotective, but its AD expression is lower (p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, only in AD and Cux2+/Rorb + neurons, rs78710909C is associated with a lower average BIN1 neuronal isoform ratio (p &lt; 0.01). The genes upregulated in neurons with lower neuronal isoform ratio were associated with the hallmarks of AD pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: In a disease-relevant mechanism, the BIN1 SNP rs78710909C is associated with a lower ratio of BIN1's neuronal isoform which increases the vulnerability of specific excitatory neurons in AD patients.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40018526,Development and validation of a population-based risk algorithm for premature mortality in Canada: the Premature Mortality Population Risk Tool (PreMPoRT).,"INTRODUCTION: To develop and validate the Premature Mortality Population Risk Tool (PreMPoRT), a population-based risk algorithm that predicts the 5-year incidence of premature mortality among the Canadian adult population.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis used six cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics Database (2000-2017). The cohort comprised 500 870 adults (18-74 years). Predictors included sociodemographic factors, self-perceived measures, health behaviours and chronic conditions. Three models (minimal, primary and full) were developed. PreMPoRT was internally validated using a split set approach and externally validated across three hold-out cycles. Performance was assessed based on predictive accuracy, discrimination and calibration.
RESULTS: The cohort included 267 460 females and 233 410 males. Premature deaths occurred in 1.40% of females and 2.05% of males. Primary models had 12 predictors (females) and 13 predictors (males). Shared predictors included age, income quintile, education, self-perceived health, smoking, emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and stroke. Male-specific predictors were marital status, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis while female-specific predictors were body mass index and physical activity. External validation cohort differed slightly in demographics. Female model performance: split set (c-statistic: 0.852), external (c-statistic: 0.856). Male model performance: split set and external (c-statistic: 0.846). Calibration showed slight overprediction for high-risk individuals and good calibration in key subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: PreMPoRT achieved the strongest discrimination and calibration among existing prediction models for premature mortality. The model produces reliable estimates of future incidence of premature mortality and may be used to identify subgroups who may benefit from public health interventions.",BMJ Public Health
40045802,What is idiopathic in normal pressure hydrocephalus?,"INTRODUCTION: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can be caused by acquired events - e.g. subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or trauma - or can be ""idiopathic"" (iNPH) when no clear cause is identifiable. The entity and nosology of iNPH has received renewed attention and has recently gone through scrutiny and academic debate.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Authors searched PubMed using the following keywords: ""adult hydrocephalus,"" ""alfa synuclein,"" ""Alzheimer's disease,"" ""beta-amyloid,"" ""cerebrospinal fluid,"" ""cilia,"" ""CSF,"" ""genes,"" ""hydrocephalus,"" ""idiopathic,"" ""Lewy Body Dementia,"" ""phosphorylated tau,"" ""shunt responsiveness"".
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: During the past decades several studies have reshaped our view of iNPH, examples are the identification of monogenic forms of iNPH caused by genes involved in the structure and function of cilia or the discovery of the glymphatic system. This review will discuss the causes of iNPH and particularly the relationship with neurodegeneration in terms of: 1) coincidental association; 2) iNPH predisposing to neurodegeneration, 3. neurodegeneration predisposing to iNPH, and 4. independent processes (genetic and environmental) predisposing to both. Based on the gathered evidence, a unified model is then presented, characterized by three sequential events: impairment of CSF dynamic, occurrence of reversible signs, occurrence of irreversible signs.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost 70 years after its description, a growing literature on its basic mechanisms is clarifying that iNPH is a syndrome with pathogenetic mechanisms arising from different causes. The paradigm shift has been recognizing that iNPH is not just a CSF disorder but rather a brain disorder expressing with ventriculomegaly. Finally, the better understanding of what causes iNPH support the proposal of changing its name into ""Hakim's disease.""",J Neurosurg Sci
40109740,Contilisant-Belinostat Hybrids: Polyfunctionalized Indole Derivatives as Multineurotarget Drugs for the Potential Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"In this work, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated two types of multineurotargeting compounds using a pharmacophore merging strategy, aiming to develop potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease. We combined belinostat, an FDA-approved unselective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, with the 5-substituted indole core of contilisant, known for its antioxidant and neuroprotective properties as well as its potent inhibitory activity against monoamine oxidases (MAOs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Among these, compounds 8c (HDAC1, IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.019 μM; HDAC6, IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.040 μM; AChE, IC<sub>50</sub> = 20.06 μM; BChE, IC<sub>50</sub> = 17.10 μM; MAO-B, IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.14 μM), and 9c (HDAC1, IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.126 μM; HDAC6, IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.020 μM; AChE, IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.73 μM; BChE, IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.03 μM; MAO-B, IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.18 μM) emerged as the most promising candidates. These compounds warrant further investigation as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease due to their unique inhibition profiles and favorable mode of inhibition.",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci
40008231,Evaluation of machine learning models for the prediction of Alzheimer's: In search of the best performance.,"Alzheimer's is a progressive and degenerative disease affecting millions worldwide, incapacitating them physically and cognitively. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of Machine Learning models to determine the model with the best performance in predicting Alzheimer's disease. The models used were Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR). Two datasets called OASIS were used to train the models, the first one had a total of 436 records and 12 variables, while the second one stored 373 records and 15 variables. The article's content is divided into six main sections: introduction, literature review, methodological approach, results, discussions, and conclusions. After processing and pooling the datasets, RF, SVM, and LR proved the best predictors, achieving 96% accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. This study highlights the efficacy of RF, SVM, and LR in predicting Alzheimer's disease, offering a significant advance toward understanding and management of this disease, which supports the relevance of implementing these models in future research and clinical applications.",Brain Behav Immun Health
40155901,Chronic loneliness and longitudinal changes in cognitive functioning.,"BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a worldwide concern with significant health implications that may be a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In light of the importance of detecting early cognitive changes and risk factors influencing cognitive health, this study examined whether chronic loneliness predicted cognitive changes among young and middle-aged adults.
METHODS: This study utilizes data from a longitudinal measurement burst study spanning over two years, comprising three waves of data collection. A systematically recruited young to mid-life adult sample (25- 65 years) included 172 racially and economically diverse participants who provided information about loneliness for at least two consecutive waves. Chronic loneliness was defined based on the validated multi-item PROMIS Social Isolation scale. We assessed working memory, processing speed, and spatial memory in a measurement burst design using mobile cognitive assessments. Multilevel growth models were conducted to examine whether chronic loneliness was associated with changes in cognitive performance during the study period of up to two years.
RESULTS: Results revealed that chronic loneliness was not associated with baseline performance of working memory, processing speed, spatial memory or global cognitive performance, but chronic loneliness was associated with differential cognitive trajectories, specifically a lack of retest related improvement. There were no significant changes in cognitive performance for the chronic loneliness group across waves, whereas significant improvements were observed in those who were not chronically lonely.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into the impact of chronic loneliness on cognitive changes in young and middle-aged adults, revealing that chronically lonely individuals did not exhibit the practice-related improvements that are commonly observed in longitudinal studies. Findings suggest the potential significance of identifying and addressing chronic loneliness promptly to prevent potential cognitive consequences of chronic loneliness.",BMC Public Health
40100204,Three-Dimensional β-Amyloid Burden Correlation Between the Eye and Brain in Alzheimer's Disease Mice Using Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy.,"PURPOSE: Recent studies have highlighted the significance of peripheral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, identifying the eye as a potential early detection site for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, previous two-dimensional AD ocular studies have been unable to establish a clear correlation between the three-dimensional Aβ accumulation in the entire eyeball and brain while preserving structural integrity. This study employed a combined brain amyloid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) platform to assess whether the three-dimensionally measured Aβ burden in the eyeball correlates with that in the brain.
METHODS: Thirteen eyeballs (6 AD, 7 control) and 17 brains (10 AD, 7 control) were collected from ten 44-week-old 5xFAD and seven control mice. The samples underwent tissue clearing and staining with thioflavin S (Aβ), anti-CD11b (microglia), and anti-ACSA-2 (astrocytes) for LSFM imaging and quantified via 3D surface volume. Standardized uptake value ratios from [18F]Flutemetamol PET/MR were also calculated.
RESULTS: AD eyeballs presented significantly greater plaque-like surface volumes (median, 51,091,002 µm³ [interquartile range, 38,488,272-64,869,828]) than controls (229,293 µm³ [115,863-311,5320]; P = 0.001). AD brains exhibited higher [18F]Flutemetamol uptake and greater plaque-like surface volumes (898,634,368 µm³ [556,263,488-1,105,326,720]) than controls (33,320,178 µm³ [26,842,538-62,716,956]; P < 0.001). A strong positive correlation was observed between the plaque-like surface volumes in the brain and that in the eyeball (r = 0.810, P = 0.001). No significant correlations were found in other morphologic parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation of a strong correlation between the three-dimensional Aβ burden in the whole eyeball and brain advances our understanding of the systemic nature of Aβ pathology and suggests ocular Aβ as a potential independent predictor of brain Aβ burden.",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci
40072673,Unveiling the neuroprotective potential of Ipomoea carnea ethanol extract via the modulation of tau and β-secretase pathways in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced memory impairment in rats in relation to its phytochemical profiling.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread condition that affects adults and the community considerably. The causes are yet unknown, except from advanced age and genetic predisposition. Natural products provided advantageous advantages for managing AD due to their efficacy, safety, and accessibility. The memory boosting effects of chemically characterized Ipomoea carnea ethanol extract (IPC-EtOH) on behavioral, biochemical, histological, and molecular levels against cognitive impairment induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub> exposure in rats were assessed using donepezil as a reference drug. Behavioral tests (spontaneous alternation T-maze and open field test) and assays for GSK3β, CREB, FOXO1a, β-secretase, tau, oxidative stress biomarkers, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were conducted. The chemical profiling of IPC-EtOH using UPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS coupled with molecular networking revealed the identification of 83 bioactive metabolites, including pyrrolizidine alkaloids and cinnamic acid derivatives which previously undescribed from this species. AlCl<sub>3</sub> injection significantly elevated tau, β-secretase, GSSG, GSK-3β, and FOXO3a levels and down regulated CAT, SOD, and CREB, with strong COX-2 immunoexpression in the cortex and hippocampus compared to controls. Oral co-administration of donepezil or IPC-EtOH to AlCl<sub>3</sub>-treated rats restored near-normal function in these brain regions, significantly attenuating spatial learning, memory, and locomotor impairments. These results suggest that IPC-EtOH could be a promising therapy for mitigating aluminum-induced neurotoxicity, though further studies are needed to elucidate its precise mechanisms of action. These outcomes emphasize I. carnea ethanol extract's potential as an appealing therapy for AD by demonstrating its neuroprotective and memory-enhancing properties in rats having AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced memory impairment.",Inflammopharmacology
40042496,Predicted natural progression as an Alzheimer's prognostic covariate improves the precision of lecanemab efficacy assessments and clinical trial efficiency.,"BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression introduces variability in treatment effect assessments. Using predicted future progression as an AD prognostic covariate (APC) may reduce this variability. This study evaluates this strategy in lecanemab trials and its implications for AD trial design.
METHODS: Two APCs were derived at baseline for each trial participant from published models with historical controls: one with clinical features, the other adding structural MRI features. Their impact on estimating the difference in cognitive decline between the treatment and placebo arms and the time saved from delayed progression (TSDP) was assessed.
RESULTS: Incorporating either APC reduced variance estimates by up to 19.1% across phase II and phase III trials, increased power to 90.2%, and reduced sample size by 27.2%. These APCs improved treatment effect estimates and TSDP, demonstrating broad applicability across endpoints.
DISCUSSION: APCs enhance treatment effect evaluation, improve statistical power, and reduce required sample sizes in Alzheimer's trials.
GOV IDENTIFIERS: NCT01767311 (Lecanemab Study 201), NCT03887455 (Lecanemab Study 301; ClarityAD).
HIGHLIGHTS: Baseline prediction of future progression can serve as an APC for treatment effect assessments. These predictions can be derived from progression models developed using external controls. APC accounts for heterogeneity in progression among trial participants, improving treatment effect estimates. Enhanced accuracy and precision were observed across lecanemab phase II and phase III trials for various endpoints. This approach results in substantial increase in statistical power and reduced sample size for future AD trials.",Alzheimers Dement
40069774,A versatile mouse model to advance human microglia transplantation research in neurodegenerative diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies highlight the critical role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders, and emphasize the need for humanized models to accurately study microglial responses. Human-mouse microglia xenotransplantation models are a valuable platform for functional studies and for testing therapeutic approaches, yet currently those models are only available for academic research. This hampers their implementation for the development and testing of medication that targets human microglia.
METHODS: We developed the hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> mouse line, which is suitable as a new transplantation model and available to be crossed to any disease model of interest. The hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> model created by CRISPR gene editing is RAG2 deficient and expresses human CSF1. Additionally, we crossed this model with two humanized App KI mice, the App<sup>Hu</sup> and the App<sup>SAA</sup>. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and bulk sequencing was used to study the response of microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate the successful transplantation of iPSC-derived human microglia into the brains of hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> mice without triggering a NK-driven immune response. Furthermore, we confirmed the multipronged response of microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> and the crosses with the Alzheimer's disease knock-in model App<sup>SAA</sup> and the humanized App knock-in control mice, App<sup>Hu</sup> are deposited with EMMA and fully accessible to the research community.
CONCLUSION: The hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> mouse is available for both non-profit and for-profit organisations, facilitating the use of the xenotransplantation paradigm for human microglia to study complex human disease.",Mol Neurodegener
40008916,"Comparing Alzheimer's genes in African, European, and Amerindian induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia.","INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate ancestry-specific loci. Previous studies in the regulatory architecture have only been conducted in Europeans (EUs), thus studies in additional ancestries are needed. Given the prevalence of AD genes expressed in microglia, we initiated our studies in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived microglia.
METHODS: We created iPSC-derived microglia from 13 individuals of either high Amerindian (AI), African (AF), or EU global ancestry, including both AD and controls. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and pathway analyses were compared between ancestries in both AD and non-AD genes.
RESULTS: Twelve AD genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and/or accessible between ancestries, including ABI3, CTSB, and MS4A6A. A total of 5% of all genes had differential ancestral expression, but differences in accessibility were less than 1%. The DEGs were enriched in known AD pathways.
DISCUSSION: This resource will be valuable in evaluating AD in admixed populations and other neurological disorders and understanding the AD risk differences between populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: First comparison of the genomics of AI, AF, and EU microglia. Report differences in expression and accessibility of AD genes between ancestries. Ancestral expression differences are greater than differences in accessibility. Good transcriptome correlation was seen between brain and iPSC-derived microglia. Differentially expressed AD genes were in known AD pathways.",Alzheimers Dement
40161933,"Anti-Alzheimer effects of the newly synthesized cationic compounds as multi-target dual hAChE/hBuChE inhibitor: An in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approach.","INTRODUCTION: Multi-target anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) compounds are promising leads for the development of AD modifying agents. Ionic compounds containing quaternary ammonium moiety were synthesized, and their multi-targeted anti-AD effects were examined.
METHODS: Imidazole derivatives containing a quaternary ammonium moiety were synthesized and evaluated for their potential anti-Alzheimer properties using computational (in silico), cellular (in vitro), and animal (in vivo) models. The inhibition kinetics of both human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) were assessed. Neuroprotective effects in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-exposed PC12 cells were also examined. Furthermore, the compounds' impact on Aβ-induced memory impairment in Wistar rats was evaluated, with a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: Compound 5g demonstrated acceptable cytotoxicity against human cells. This compound exhibited non-competitive dual inhibition of both hAChE and hBuChE. Additionally, compound 5g mitigated the morphological changes induced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) in PC12 cells and decreased cell mortality. It exhibited anti-oxidative stress properties, evident by reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The compound also down regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1β and TNF-α. In vitro studies validated compound 5g's ability to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), attenuate neuroinflammation, and prevent the autophagy-apoptosis cascade. When administered to rats with Aβ-induced memory dysfunction, compound 5g enhanced cognitive function and improved spatial memory. In the hippocampi of treated rats, there was a noted downregulation of TNF-α and NF-kB. Furthermore, compound 5g counteracted the elevated activity of AChE. Molecular modeling validated the binding of compound 5g to both steric and catalytic sites of cholinesterase enzymes.
CONCLUSION: The novel quaternary ammonium derivative, compound 5g, demonstrated multi-target anti-AD properties, as evidenced by in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies. Behavioral assessments and molecular analyses further confirmed its therapeutic efficacy in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-challenged rats.",Bioimpacts

40038883,"First in class pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives fused to fluorobenzylpiperidines as dual ligands of acetylcholinesterase and histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with manifold underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore, multitarget-directed ligands potentially offer beneficial therapeutic effects compared with classical therapies. Dual targeting of the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor (H<sub>3</sub>R) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a valid strategy for the treatment of AD. In this work, a new series of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines fused to fluorobenzylpiperidine derivatives was designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically evaluated. Among the 16 derivatives reported here, compounds 4a (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.19 µM for human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and K<sub>i</sub> = 1.05 µM for H<sub>3</sub>R) and 4f (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.27 µM for hAChE and K<sub>i</sub> = 1.31 µM for H<sub>3</sub>R) show the most balanced dual targeting behavior coupled with moderate affinities at both targets. Selected compounds showed medium inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Moreover, these compounds did not show any toxicity in the SH-SY5Y or HEK-293 cell lines at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. In silico studies allowed the proposition of binding modes and the prediction of favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties. The cumulative results suggest compounds 4a and 4f as lead structures for the further development of novel dual-targeted ligands for AD therapy.",Arch Pharm (Weinheim)
39995873,Imaging lipid rafts reveals the principle of ApoE4-induced Aβ upregulation in human neurons.,"Lipid rafts in plasma membranes are thought to provide a platform for regulating signaling pathways by increasing the expression or proximity of proteins in the same pathway. Despite this understanding, the absence of direct, simultaneous observations of lipid rafts and their affiliated proteins has hindered a comprehensive assessment of their roles across various biological contexts. Amyloid-β (Aβ), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is generated from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) by β- and γ-secretases, primarily within endosomes after APP endocytosis by canonical clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neurons. In this study, we developed a protocol for imaging APP on lipid rafts using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and found that astrocyte ApoE4 contributes to an increase in APP localization on lipid rafts, subsequently elevating Aβ<sub>42</sub> synthesis in a clathrin-independent manner in neurons.",iScience

Given the multifactorial nature of AD, multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) hold promise in developing effective drugs for AD. Phosphodiesterase-9 (PDE9) is emerging as a promising target for AD therapy. In this study, by combining a PDE9 inhibitor C33 with the antioxidant melatonin, we designed and discovered a series of pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives that simultaneously inhibit PDE9 and possess antioxidant activities. Molecular docking, together with dynamics simulations, were applied to accelerate compound design and reduce synthetic work. Four out of the 14 compounds were validated as effective PDE9 inhibitors with comparable antioxidant activity. Notably, compounds 17b and 17d demonstrated IC<sub>50</sub> values of 91 and 89 nM against PDE9, respectively, with good antioxidant activities (ORAC (Trolox) of 2.00 and 2.60). This work provides a new approach for designing MTDLs for the treatment of AD and offers insights for further structural modifications of PDE9 inhibitors with antioxidant capacities.",Antioxidants (Basel)
40023297,Cyclophilin D (CypD) ablation prevents neurodegeneration and cognitive damage induced by caspase-3 cleaved tau.,"Abnormal tau modifications are one of the main contributors to neurodegenerative processes present during Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, truncated tau by caspase-3, a pathological tau form, affects mitochondrial function and antioxidant regulation, contributing to synaptic and cognitive impairment in AD mouse models. We previously showed that the presence of caspase-3 cleaved tau promotes mitochondrial impairment in neuronal cells, where Cyclophilin-D (CypD) protein could be a crucial element. CypD is considered the master regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and its ablation prevents neurodegenerative and cognitive damage induced by β-amyloid in mouse models of AD. However, the possible role of CypD in the neurodegenerative processes mediated by caspase-3-cleaved tau has not been explored. Here, we use tau (-/-) and CypD (-/-) knock-out mice that were subjected to right-side hippocampal stereotaxic injection to induce GFP (AAV-Syn-GFP), full-length (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4) or caspase-3-cleaved (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4C3) tau expression. Then, cognitive performance, synaptic architecture, and hippocampal mitochondrial function were evaluated two months later. We observed that caspase-3 cleaved tau expression inducing cognitive decline, vesicle and synaptic protein deregulation, and mitochondrial impairment generated by the mPTP opening. More interestingly, when caspase-3 cleaved tau was expressed in the hippocampus of CypD (-/-) mice, cognitive decline, synaptic impairment, and mitochondrial damage mediated by mPTP were prevented, demonstrating a novel role of CypD in neurodegenerative changes induced by truncated tau in AD.",Free Radic Biol Med
40033766,Relationships Between Brain Glucose Metabolism Patterns and Impaired Glycemic Status: A Systematic Review of FDG-PET Studies With a Focus on Alzheimer's Disease.,"It is well-established that individuals with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is not fully determined how insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are related to AD-related brain glucose metabolism abnormalities. For this aim, we performed a systematic review of the studies investigating the association between cerebral glucose metabolism and glycemic status, including diabetes, insulin resistance, or hyperglycemia. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched (till February 2, 2025). All English full-text papers studying 18F-FDG-PET that investigated the association between cerebral FDG uptake or cerebral metabolism rate and glycemic status were included. These studies were reviewed for quality assessment, data extraction, and qualitative synthesis. After screening titles and abstracts of 718 unique records identified from our search, 23 studies (5308 participants) addressing the association between brain glucose metabolism alterations, as assessed by FDG-PET scan, and glycemic status were included for qualitative analysis. Of these 23 studies, 22 studies suggested that hyperglycemia or insulin resistance is related to global or regional cerebral glucose hypometabolism. The regional brain metabolism reductions were mostly in the frontal cortex, parietotemporal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus cortex, known as AD-signature areas. Hyperglycemia, diabetes, and insulin resistance are associated with cerebral glucose hypometabolism in similar regions compared to AD. This can suggest that even in cognitively normal individuals, insulin resistance can potentially increase the predisposition to abnormal AD-like glucose metabolism.",Hum Brain Mapp
40167883,Unraveling the Role of LRP1 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Focus on Aβ Clearance and the Liver-Brain Axis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, significantly contributing to the global health burden. The progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles triggers neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage, highlighting the critical need for effective clearance mechanisms. Recent research has identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a key factor in the regulation of Aβ clearance, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly in relation to the liver-brain axis. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the role of LRP1 in AD, focusing on its expression in the brain and liver, its contribution to Aβ metabolism, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Using a systematic literature review, LRP1's multifaceted roles across various biological processes were explored, including its involvement in Aβ transport, clearance via the liver, and modulation of neuroinflammation. Additionally, the impact of physical exercise, pharmacological interventions, and dietary factors on LRP1 expression levels was investigated, elucidating how these approaches may enhance Aβ clearance. The findings demonstrate that LRP1 expression decreases progressively as AD advances, and that augmenting LRP1 activity-particularly through exercise and drug therapies-can improve Aβ clearance and reduce neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, LRP1's involvement in the liver-brain axis reveals its broader systemic role in AD pathology. In conclusion, targeting LRP1 offers a promising avenue for AD prevention and treatment, providing new insights into the therapeutic potential of enhancing Aβ clearance pathways through the liver-brain axis.",J Mol Neurosci
40083013,Exploration of working memory retrieval stage for mild cognitive impairment: time-varying causality analysis of electroencephalogram based on dynamic brain networks.,"BACKGROUND: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its management is crucial for it helps intervene and slow the progression of cognitive decline to AD. However, the understanding of the MCI mechanism is not completely clear. As working memory (WM) damage is a common symptom of MCI, this study focused on the core stage of WM, i.e., the memory retrieval stage, to investigate information processing and the causality relationships among brain regions based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
METHOD: 21 MCI and 20 normal cognitive control (NC) participants were recruited. The delayed matching sample paradigm with two different loads was employed to evaluate their WM functions. A time-varying network based on the Adaptive transfer function (ADTF) was constructed on the EEG of the memory retrieval trials.to perform the dynamic brain network analysis.
RESULTS: Our results showed that: (a) Behavioral data analysis: there were significant differences in accuracy and accuracy / reaction time between MCI and NC in tasks with memory load capacity of low load-four and high load-six, especially in tasks with memory load capacity of four. (b) Dynamic brain network analysis: there were significant differences in the dynamic changes of brain network patterns between the two groups during the memory retrieval stage of the WM task. Specifically, in low load WM tasks, the dynamic brain network changes of NC were more regular to accommodate for efficient information processing, with important core nodes showing a transition from bottom to up, while MCI did not display a regular dynamic brain network pattern. Further, the brain functional areas associated with low load WM disorders were mainly located in the left prefrontal lobe (FC1) and right occipital lobe (PO8). Compared with low load WM task, during the high load WM task, the dynamic brain network changes of NC during the memory retrieval stage were regular, and the core nodes exhibited a consistent transition phenomenon from up to bottom to up, which were not observed in MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral data in the low load WM task paradigm and abnormal electrophysiological signals in the left prefrontal (FC1) and right occipital lobes (PO8) could be used for MCI diagnosis. This is the first time based on large-scale dynamic network methods to investigate the dynamic network patterns of MCI memory retrieval stages under different load WM tasks, providing a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of WM deficits in MCI patients and providing some reference for the clinical intervention treatment of MCI-WM memory disorders.",J Neuroeng Rehabil

Linear regression models evaluated the associations between social support or chronic stress and Alzheimer's-related blood-based biomarkers (BBMs), including amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, and total tau (t-tau). Interactions between chronic stress or social support and gender or race/ethnicity in relation to BBMs were assessed.
RESULTS: Higher chronic stress was associated with higher levels of t-tau. Higher social support was associated with lower levels of NfL. Neither gender nor race/ethnicity modified the associations between chronic stress or social support and BBM levels.
DISCUSSION: Chronic stress and social support are associated with BBMs of neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher chronic stress was associated with higher levels of plasma total tau. Higher social support was associated with lower levels of plasma neurofilament light chain. Neither gender nor race/ethnicity modified the associations between chronic stress or social support and levels of blood-based biomarkers. Chronic stress and social support affect pathways related to neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement
39992002,Superhydrophilic Nanostructured Microparticles for Enhanced Phosphoprotein Enrichment from Alzheimer's Disease Brain.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder and closely related to abnormal phosphoproteoforms. The analysis of low-abundance phosphoproteoforms relies heavily on the enrichment of phosphoproteins. However, existing phosphoprotein enrichment materials suffer from either low selectivity or low coverage due to the unavoidable unspecific adsorption of background proteins. Here, we propose a strategy of nanostructure-enabled superhydrophilic surfaces and synthesize Ti<sup>4+</sup>-functionalized superhydrophilic nanostructured microparticles (SNMs-Ti<sup>4+</sup>) via an emulsion interfacial polymerization process. In this process, hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers assemble into a stable oil-in-water emulsion, producing microparticles with abundant hydrophilic phosphate nanoprotrusions on the surface. The microparticles are subsequently functionalized with Ti<sup>4+</sup>. SNMs-Ti<sup>4+</sup> exhibit enormous nanoprotrusions and abundant Ti<sup>4+</sup> modifications, which allow SNMs-Ti<sup>4+</sup> to effectively adsorb the phosphoproteins and suppress the unspecific adsorption of background proteins. Using these SNMs-Ti<sup>4+</sup>, we identified 2256 phosphoproteins from HeLa cells, twice the number of those enriched with commercial kits. From AD mouse brains, 2603 phosphoproteins were successfully enriched, and 10 times of AD-related differentially regulated phosphoproteins were discovered than those without enrichment. These microparticles show great prospects for biomarker detection, disease diagnosis, and downstream biological process disclosure.",ACS Nano
40082619,Interleukin-12 signaling drives Alzheimer's disease pathology through disrupting neuronal and oligodendrocyte homeostasis.,"Neuroinflammation including interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23-signaling is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Inhibition of p40, a subunit of IL-12/IL-23, attenuates pathology in AD-like mice; however, its signaling mechanism and expression pattern remained elusive. Here we show that IL-12 receptors are predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes in AD-like APPPS1 mice and in patients with AD, whereas IL-23 receptor transcripts are barely detectable. Consistently, deletion of the IL-12 receptor in neuroectodermal cells ameliorated AD pathology in APPPS1 mice, whereas removal of IL-23 receptors had no effect. Genetic ablation of IL-12 signaling alone reverted the loss of mature oligodendrocytes, restored myelin homeostasis, rescued the amyloid-β-dependent reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and restored phagocytosis-related changes in microglia of APPPS1 mice. Furthermore, IL-12 protein expression was increased in human AD brains compared to healthy age-matched controls, and human oligodendrocyte-like cells responded profoundly to IL-12 stimulation. We conclude that oligodendroglial and neuronal IL-12 signaling, but not IL-23 signaling, are key in orchestrating AD-related neuroimmune crosstalk and that IL-12 represents an attractive therapeutic target in AD.",Nat Aging
40141445,TBG096 Ameliorates Memory Deficiency in AD Mouse Model via Promoting Neurogenesis and Regulation of Hsc70/HK2/PKM2/LAMP2A Signaling Pathway.,"In previous studies, we isolated a series of novel gentisides with nerve growth factor (NGF)-mimic activities from Gentiana rigescens Franch and conducted continuous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Recently, a lead compound named TBG096 was discovered with significant NGF-mimic activity, low toxicity, and ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). At the cell level, TBG096 exerts NGF-mimic activity by regulation of heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) and downstream proteins. Subsequently, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse models were used to evaluate the anti-AD efficacy of the compound. TBG096 significantly improved the memory dysfunction of AD mice at doses of 0.1, 5, and 20 mg/kg, respectively. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of the compound against AD, the RNA-sequence analysis of transcriptomics, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot analysis were performed using animal samples. TBG096 significantly increased the expression of the Wnt gene family (Wnt10b, Wnt5a, and Wnt1) and the number of mature neurons and newborn neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AD mice, respectively. At the same time, it reduced the activity of microglia, astrocyte cells, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) in the brain. Moreover, this compound significantly increased phosphorylated-adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Hsc70, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a (LAMP2A) and decreased the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), amyloid precursor protein (APP), microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau), phosphoryl-Tau, and β-amyloid (Aβ) at the protein level. These results suggest that TBG096 produced the NGF-mimic activity and the anti-AD effect via promoting neurogenesis and modification of the Hsc70/HK2/PKM2/LAMP2A signaling pathway, proposing a potential novel approach to counteracting cognitive decline by developing small molecules that promote neurogenesis and the Hsc70 signaling pathway.",Int J Mol Sci
40074096,Lancao decoction alleviates Alzheimer's disease: Depending on activating CaMKII to protect neuronal refunction by reducing β-amyloid in the hippocampus.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCY: Lancao decoction (LC) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation mentioned in the ""Huangdineijing"", known for its ability to dispel turbidity and eliminate heat. TCM believes that the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is phlegm turbidity, and the fiery internal obstruction of the gods, which suggests that LC has the possibility of treating.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation will examine the possibilities of LC to improve AD and uncover the underlying mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas chromatography (GC) and HPLC-MS were used to identify the content of the primary elements in LC and test the stability of its extraction. The function of LC in ameliorating AD was characterized by utilizing behavioral assessments such as the Morris water maze (MWM) and the Y-maze in AD modeling mice. Levels of molecular signaling and neurogenesis within the hippocampus was assessed using Western blot and immunostaining. Pharmacological interventions were used to explore the association of specific targets with neurogenesis and synaptic proteins and their contributions in LC improvement of AD.
RESULTS: The main components of LC include p-Cymene, 3-Methoxy-p-cymene, neryl acetate, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid and euparin. APP/PS1 mice displayed behavioral characteristics indicative of memory and learning deficits, such as a notably longer time taken to reach the platform and reduced time spent in the area without the platform in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), as well as a longer delay in exploring the new arm and less time spent in the new arm in the Y-maze, when compared to C57BL6/J mice. However, these impairments were alleviated by chronic treatment with either LC or donepezil (DON) over a period of 14 days. Additionally, the phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and the amounts of synaptic proteins (synapsin1 and PSD95) were greatly diminished within the hippocampal region of APP/PS1 mice, which were also reversed by LC or DON. In addition, Aβ area was obviously increased in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 murine model, which was also reversed by LC or DON. Inhibition of CaMKII activities not only blunted LC's therapeutic actions of AD, but also blocked the enhancements of LC on synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, the quantity of cells that are co-stained with BrdU and DCX, and Ki67-positive cells located in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that LC activated CaMKII to relieve Aβ formation, thereby enhancing neuronal functions in the hippocampus, and thus alleviated AD, which provided a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of the mechanism, clinical application, and subsequent research of LC in alleviating AD.",J Ethnopharmacol
40000573,Methods to crosswalk between cognitive test scores using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies use multiple different instruments to measure dementia-related outcomes, making head-to-head comparisons of interventions difficult.
METHODS: To address this gap, we developed two methods to crosswalk estimated treatment effects on cognitive outcomes that are flexible, broadly applicable, and do not rely on strong distributional assumptions.
RESULTS: We present two methods to crosswalk effect estimates using one measure to estimates using another measure, illustrated with global cognitive measures from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we develop crosswalks for the following measures and associated change scores over time: the clinical dementia rating scale sum of box (CDR-SB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Finally, a setting in which crosswalking is not appropriate is illustrated with plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentration and global cognitive measures.
DISCUSSION: Given the inconsistent collection and reporting of dementia and cognitive outcomes across studies, these crosswalking methods offer a valuable approach to harmonizing and comparing results reported on different scales.
HIGHLIGHTS: Developed methods to crosswalk from one cognitive outcome to another in studies of dementia interventions. Methods illustrated using combinations of global cognitive tests: the CDR-SB, MoCA, and MMSE. Illustrates scenarios where crosswalking may not be appropriate for certain combinations of measures. Crosswalking methods support comparison of interventions with accurate error propagation. Facilitates inclusion of more studies in meta-analyses by increasing data comparability.",Alzheimers Dement
40016526,Alzheimer's disease biological PET staging using plasma p217+tau.,"BACKGROUND: Plasma phospho-tau biomarkers, such as p217+tau, excel at identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. However, their ability to substitute for tau PET to identify AD biological stage is unclear.
METHODS: Participants included 248 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 227 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, with Janssen plasma p217+tau Simoa® assay, <sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694 Aβ-PET (A) and <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240 tau-PET (T) data. Biological PET stages were defined according to the Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of Alzheimer's Disease (2024): Initial (A + T-), Early (A + T<sub>MTL</sub> + ), Intermediate (A + T<sub>MOD</sub> + ), and Advanced (A + T<sub>HIGH</sub> + ). The threshold for A+ was 25 Centiloid and for T<sub>HIGH</sub> + , the 75th percentile SUVR<sub>temporo-parietal</sub> in A + CI. Sixty percent were A + , 36% Intermediate/Advanced, and 9% Advanced. The performance of p217+tau in discriminating AD stages was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Plasma p217+tau concentrations increase across the AD biological PET stages, except between Initial and Early stages. Screening for all AD stages (vs. A-T-), combined Intermediate/Advanced stages, or Advanced stage yields AUC of 0.92, 0.92, and 0.91, respectively (CI only: AUC 0.93, 0.89, 0.83). Plasma p217+tau Youden threshold provides sensitivity of 0.77 [0.73-0.90], specificity 0.91 [0.80-0.95], PPV 0.84 [0.71-0.89], and NPV 0.88 [0.85-0.93] for combined Intermediate/Advanced stages. For the Advanced stage alone, sensitivity is 0.89 [0.79-0.97], specificity 0.82 [0.75-0.9], NPV 0.99 [0.98-1.0], but PPV is only 0.33 [0.25-0.47].
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to accurately screening for A+ individuals, plasma p217+tau is useful for identifying a combined Intermediate/Advanced stage AD cohort or pre-screening to reduce the tau-PET required to identify Advanced stage AD individuals.",Commun Med (Lond)
40035279,An Overview of Anesthetic Procedures for Ferret (Mustela putorius furo) Preclinical Brain MRI: A Call for Standardization.,"Neuroscience research has been increasingly active during the last 2 decades, largely driven by the high prevalence and increasing burden of neurologic disorders. While rodents are essential models for biomedical research of neurologic disorders, they lack similar brain anatomy and protein expression profiles to humans, thus limiting their translational value as models of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The use of ferrets as a model species in neuroscience has been increasing due to their neuroanatomical similarities with humans, including a gyrencephalic brain and larger white matter-to-gray matter ratio. Compared with nonhuman primates, sheep, and swine, ferrets also have the advantages of reduced size, lower housing costs, and lower phylogenetic order. These, among other advantages, make ferrets a promising species to bridge research gaps and complement traditional rodent studies. Although modern neuroscience research in ferrets relies heavily on advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most of the preclinical MRI installations are not designed or optimized for use with ferrets. In this paper we discuss the intricacies and limitations that need to be considered when performing ferret MRI procedures. Reviews of ferret biologic peculiarities, anesthetic protocols, management of complications, and the impact of these factors on MRI outcomes are presented. Standardizing anesthesia protocols for the conduct of MRI in ferrets will aid in better physiologic monitoring as well as imaging outcomes that ultimately benefit the science being conducted.",J Am Assoc Lab Anim Sci
40076235,27-Hydroxymangiferolic Acid Extends Lifespan and Improves Neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans by Activating Nuclear Receptors.,"27-Hydroxymangiferolic acid (27-HMA) is a naturally occurring compound in mango fruits that exhibits diverse biological functions. Here, we show that 27-HMA activates the transcriptional activity of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor transcription factor, extending the lifespan and healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Meanwhile, the longevity-promoting effect of 27-HMA was attenuated in the mutants of nhr-8 and daf-12, the FXR homologs, indicating that the longevity effects of 27-HMA in C. elegans may depend on nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). Further analysis revealed potential associations between the longevity effects of 27-HMA and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS)/TORC1 pathway. Moreover, 27-HMA increased the toxin resistance of nematodes and activated the expression of detoxification genes, which rely on NHRs. Finally, 27-HMA improved the age-related neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) C. elegans models. Taken together, our findings suggest that 27-HMA is a novel FXR agonist and may prolong lifespan and healthspan via activating NHRs.",Molecules
40145955,Measuring glymphatic function: assessing the toolkit.,"Glymphatic flow has been proposed to clear brain waste while we sleep. Cerebrospinal fluid moves from periarterial to perivenous spaces through the parenchyma, with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid drainage to dural lymphatics. Glymphatic disruption is associated with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. Therefore, investigating its structure and function may improve understanding of pathophysiology. The recent controversy on whether glymphatic flow increases or decreases during sleep demonstrates that the glymphatic hypothesis remains contentious. However, discrepancies between different studies could be due to limitations of the specific techniques used and confounding factors. Here, we review the methods used to study glymphatic function and provide a toolkit from which researchers can choose. We conclude that tracer analysis has been useful, ex vivo techniques are unreliable, and in vivo imaging is still limited. Finally, we explore the potential for future methods and highlight the need for in vitro models, such as microfluidic devices, which may address technique limitations and enable progression of the field.",Neural Regen Res
40056822,Associations between dietary B vitamin intakes and cognitive function among elderly individuals: An observational study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the associations between dietary B vitamin intakes and the prevalence of cognitive impairment among elderly individuals in the United States.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis, based on data from 2716 participants aged 60 years or older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 to 2014. Dietary intakes of six B vitamins (vitamins B1, B2, niacin, B6, total folate, and B12) were assessed using two 24-hour dietary recalls. Cognitive function was evaluated through the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list learning test, the Animal Fluency Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Associations between dietary B vitamin intakes and cognitive impairment were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic spline regression, and weighted quantile sum regression.
RESULTS: Higher dietary intakes of B vitamins were inversely associated with the prevalence of cognitive impairment. Participants in the highest quartile of intake showed reduced odds of cognitive impairment compared to the lowest quartile for vitamin B1 (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-0.97), vitamin B2 (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29-1.02), niacin (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.65), vitamin B6 (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.79), total folate (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.31-0.89), and vitamin B12 (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.95). Restricted cubic spline analysis showed linear and inverse exposure-response relationships for all six vitamins without evidence of non-linearity. The weighted quantile sum regression indicated a combined protective effect of dietary B vitamins on cognitive impairment (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.89), with niacin contributing most to the association (weight: 0.48).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher dietary B vitamin intakes may be linked to a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment among older adults in the US. These findings suggest that adequate consumption of dietary B vitamins may be beneficial for maintaining cognitive health. Further, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these associations.",Nutrition
40034453,Contrastive self-supervised learning for neurodegenerative disorder classification.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) involve specific loss of brain volume, detectable in vivo using T1-weighted MRI scans. Supervised machine learning approaches classifying neurodegenerative diseases require diagnostic-labels for each sample. However, it can be difficult to obtain expert labels for a large amount of data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an alternative for training machine learning models without data-labels.
METHODS: We investigated if the SSL models can be applied to distinguish between different neurodegenerative disorders in an interpretable manner. Our method comprises a feature extractor and a downstream classification head. A deep convolutional neural network, trained with a contrastive loss, serves as the feature extractor that learns latent representations. The classification head is a single-layer perceptron that is trained to perform diagnostic group separation. We used N = 2,694 T1-weighted MRI scans from four data cohorts: two ADNI datasets, AIBL and FTLDNI, including cognitively normal controls (CN), cases with prodromal and clinical AD, as well as FTLD cases differentiated into its phenotypes.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the feature extractor trained in a self-supervised way provides generalizable and robust representations for the downstream classification. For AD vs. CN, our model achieves 82% balanced accuracy on the test subset and 80% on an independent holdout dataset. Similarly, the Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (BV) vs. CN model attains an 88% balanced accuracy on the test subset. The average feature attribution heatmaps obtained by the Integrated Gradient method highlighted hallmark regions, i.e., temporal gray matter atrophy for AD, and insular atrophy for BV.
CONCLUSION: Our models perform comparably to state-of-the-art supervised deep learning approaches. This suggests that the SSL methodology can successfully make use of unannotated neuroimaging datasets as training data while remaining robust and interpretable.",Front Neuroinform
40080338,Prevalence of psychiatric vulnerability and neurocognitive disorders in nursing homes: impact on care levels.,"PURPOSE: There is an increasing number of residents with more complex needs in nursing homes. Due to the deinstitutionalisation of mental health care, more individuals with psychiatric vulnerabilities are being referred to nursing homes. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the prevalence of psychiatric vulnerability in Belgian nursing homes and its impact on care levels.
METHODS: After screening 3238 patient files of residents in twenty-four Belgian nursing homes, informed consent was obtained from 1155 of the 1608 residents or their legal representatives with a neurocognitive and/or psychiatric diagnosis. Residents were classified into three groups: residents with only a psychiatric diagnosis, with only a neurocognitive diagnosis, and both a psychiatric and neurocognitive diagnosis. The Health of Nations Outcome Scale 65 + was used to assess residents' behaviour, limitations, symptoms, and functioning.
RESULTS: Of all residents, 17.5% had a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis and 41.8% had a neurocognitive disorder. Most prevalent were depressive disorder (8.2%) and Alzheimer's disease (19.3%). Scores for behavioural problems (1.4 and 1.4 versus 0.9, p < 0.0001) and symptoms (5.5 and 5.1 versus 4.4, p < 0,0001) were higher in residents with only a psychiatric or both diagnoses compared to those with only neurocognitive disorders. Conversely, scores for limitations were higher in residents with only a neurocognitive disorder (3.6 versus 2.2 and 3.1, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: With almost 1 in 5 nursing home residents having a psychiatric vulnerability with higher levels of symptoms and behavioural problems, more attention towards improving nursing home caregivers' competence in psychiatric care is recommended.",Eur Geriatr Med
40008860,Structural Annotation Method for Locating sn- and C═C Positions of Lipids Using Liquid Chromatography-Electron Impact Excitation of Ions from Organics (EIEIO)-Mass Spectrometry.,"Definitive structural elucidation of lipids is pivotal for unraveling the functions of lipids in biological systems. Despite advancements in mass spectrometry (MS) for lipid analysis, challenges in annotation scope and efficiency remain, especially in resolving isomers. Herein, we introduce an optimized method using liquid chromatography coupled with electron impact excitation of ions from organic tandem mass spectrometry (LC-EIEIO-MS/MS) for comprehensive analysis and structural annotation of lipids. This approach integrates a six-step analytical protocol for precise lipid annotation, including (1) extracting MS information, (2) classifying lipids, (3) aligning sum composition, (4) determining sn-positions, (5) locating C═C positions, and (6) ascertaining annotation levels. In analyzing 34 lipid standards spiked into serum, our method achieved 100% and 82.4% annotation accuracy at the sn- and C═C isomer levels, respectively, compared to 26.5% and 0% in the CID mode using MS-DIAL. A total of 1312 sn-positions and 1033 C═C locations of lipids were annotated in quality control plasma pooled from healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease. The isomers of lipids revealed more pronounced differences between the healthy and diseased groups compared to the sum compositions of the lipids. Overall, the LC-EIEIO-MS/MS approach provides a comprehensive profiling and efficient annotation method for lipidomics, promising to shed new light on lipid-related biological pathways and disease mechanisms.",Anal Chem
40107380,"Understanding the complex interplay between tau, amyloid and the network in the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's Disease.","INTRODUCTION: The interaction of amyloid and tau in neurodegenerative diseases is a central feature of AD pathophysiology. While experimental studies point to various interaction mechanisms, their causal direction and mode (local, remote or network-mediated) remain unknown in human subjects. The aim of this study was to compare mathematical reaction-diffusion models encoding distinct cross-species couplings to identify which interactions were key to model success.
METHODS: We tested competing mathematical models of network spread, aggregation, and amyloid-tau interactions on publicly available data from ADNI.
RESULTS: Although network spread models captured the spatiotemporal evolution of tau and amyloid in human subjects, the model including a one-way amyloid-to-tau aggregation interaction performed best.
DISCUSSION: This mathematical exposition of the ""pas de deux"" of co-evolving proteins provides quantitative, whole-brain support to the concept of amyloid-facilitated-tauopathy rather than the classic amyloid-cascade or pure-tau hypotheses, and helps explain certain known but poorly understood aspects of AD.",Prog Neurobiol

40108996,Interactions between menopause and high-fat diet on cognition and pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Post-menopausal women constitute about two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Menopause increases dementia risk by heightening the likelihood of metabolic disease, a well-known risk factor for dementia. We aimed to determine the effects of menopause and high-fat diet (HF) on cognitive and pathological outcomes in an AD mouse model.
METHODS: At 3 months old, App<sup>NL-F</sup> mice received 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (menopause model) or vehicle and were placed on a control (10% fat) or an HF diet (60% fat) until 10 months old.
RESULTS: An interaction between HF diet and menopause led to impaired recognition memory. No effects of menopause were observed on amyloid pathology. However, menopause induced alterations in microglial response, white matter, and hippocampal neurogenesis.
DISCUSSION: This work highlights the need to model endocrine aging in animal models of dementia and contributes to further understanding of the interaction between menopause and metabolic health in the context of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The combination of menopause and HF diet led to early onset of cognitive impairment. HF diet increased amyloid pathology in the hippocampus. Menopause led to an increase in microglia density and a decrease in myelin in the corpus callosum. Menopause altered hippocampal neurogenesis in a diet-dependent manner.",Alzheimers Dement
40101674,A practical overview of the use of amyloid-PET Centiloid values in clinical trials and research.,"The density of brain amyloid-beta neuritic plaque accumulation, a marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be visualized and quantified using amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET). Amyloid-PET data can be obtained using different tracers and methodologies; therefore, comparison across studies can be difficult. The introduction of Centiloids in 2015 allowed for the transformation of amyloid-PET quantitative data to a common scale, enhancing comparability across studies and potentially enabling pooled analysis. Since then, Centiloid values have been used increasingly in research and clinical trials for multiple purposes, being tested and validated with a variety of clinical, biomarker and pathological standards of truth. In clinical trials, Centiloid values have been used for patient selection, to confirm the presence of AD pathology, as well as for treatment monitoring, especially in trials of disease-modifying treatments such as amyloid-targeting therapies. Building on their widespread adoption, Centiloid values are increasingly being integrated into commercially available software solutions for quantifying amyloid-PET, paving the way for real-world applications at the community level. This article addresses frequently asked questions about Centiloid definition, implementation, interpretation, and caveats, and also summarizes the available literature on published thresholds, ultimately supporting wider access and informed use of Centiloid values in Alzheimer's disease research.",Neuroimage Clin

40047995,Tau levels in platelets isolated from Huntington's disease patients serve as a biomarker of disease severity.,"Tau is a microtubule protein that is known to be hyperphosphorylated and to aggregate in several chronic neurodegenerative disorders. In many cases, in particular in Alzheimer's disease, the degree of tau pathology has been demonstrated to correlate with cognitive deficits and/or decline. In Huntington's disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder, both cognitive impairments and abnormal tau expression have been reported to occur, along with the accumulation of the mutant huntingtin protein. In this respect, tau has been shown to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with HD and to increase with disease progression. However, how this relates to changes in tau found in the periphery is largely unknown. In this study, we collected blood samples from patients with HD and isolated multiple blood components including plasma, platelets, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to measure their tau levels and subsequently correlate these to cognitive impairments and disease stage. Our results suggest that the amount of tau, particularly N-terminal tau (NTA-tau) and total tau (t-tau), is elevated in all assayed blood components and that the quantity of tau within platelets, specifically, is strongly correlated with disease severity.",J Neurol

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, particularly at 3 Tesla (3T), offers a noninvasive method to assess cerebral blood flow alterations, which are believed to be early indicators of AD.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of 3T ASL MRI in identifying cerebral perfusion biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of AD, assess its prognostic value, and compare it to other imaging modalities, such as PET.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines across PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus using keywords related to ""ASL,"" ""3T MRI,"" and ""AD.""
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they used 3T ASL MRI to investigate CBF in AD. Reviews, preclinical studies, case reports, studies lacking 3T ASL MRI, or those focusing on other dementias or mild cognitive impairment without an AD comparison were excluded. Data extracted included study design, sample characteristics, imaging techniques, parameters measured, and outcomes. A qualitative synthesis of findings highlights CBF patterns and biomarkers associated with AD.
RESULTS: Findings demonstrated hypoperfusion in the hippocampus, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex, distinguishing AD from normal aging and other forms of dementia. CBF patterns are often correlated with the severity and progression of cognitive impairment. ASL MRI at 3T demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of PET while being noninvasive and radiation free.
CONCLUSION: ASL MRI at 3T could be a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD. Its noninvasive nature makes it ideal for repeated measures and longitudinal studies. Further research should focus on standardizing protocols and validating their use in larger populations.",J Neuroimaging
39980415,Enhanced in silico QSAR-based screening of butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors using multi-feature selection and machine learning.,"Butyrylcholinesterase inhibition offers one of the formulated solutions to tackle the aggravating symptoms of dementia that downgrades to cholinergic neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease. We developed a QSAR model to facilitate the identification of effective butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. The model employs multi-feature selection and feature learning, improving the in silico screening efficiency and accelerating drug discovery efforts. This study aims to integrate Human Intestinal Absorption (HIA) values of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) target inhibitors and their 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) with machine learning tools. The model was developed using chemical descriptors in combination with supervised machine learning classification algorithms. Random Forest Classifier algorithm proved to be the ultimate best fit for classification model metrics including log loss probability (0.04225), accuracy score (98.88%) and Matthew's correlation coefficient (0.98). Furthermore, a subset of the active dataset was used to study the regression based on HIA values using multi-feature selection and feature learning. The models were validated using precision, recall and F1 score for regression modelling. After integrating HIA data with existing machine learning algorithms, we observed a significant reduction of 89.63% in the number of inhibitors. The findings provide valuable pharmacological insights that can help in future design of drug development schemes different from conventional methods.",SAR QSAR Environ Res
40116640,Association of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers with low premorbid intellectual functioning in a multi-ethnic community-dwelling cohort: A cross-sectional study of HABS-HD.,"Background: Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) may have a five-fold increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies investigating brain aging among individuals with ID without Down syndrome (DS) are lacking. To begin addressing this gap, our study utilized word reading, a widely recognized indicator of an individual's premorbid intellectual ability (pIQ), to examine the effects of ID without DS on plasma AD biomarker outcomes. Objective: To investigate the relationship between premorbid intellectual ability (pIQ) and plasma AD biomarkers in individuals with ID without DS, while considering ethnic differences in these associations. Methods: Participants from the Health &amp; Aging Brain Study - Health Disparities (HABS-HD) were categorized into low (z ≤ -2.00) or average (z = 0.00 ± 1.00) pIQ groups based on word reading scores. Plasma biomarkers including Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-Tau181), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and total tau (t-tau) were assayed using Simoa technology. Results: Individuals with low pIQ exhibited significantly higher levels of p-Tau181 (p &lt; 0.05), NfL (p &lt; 0.05), and t-tau (p &lt; 0.05) compared to those with average pIQ. Stratified analysis by ethnicity revealed differential associations, with Hispanic and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants showing distinct biomarker profiles relative to non-Hispanic Black (NHB) individuals. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that low pIQ is a reliable factor associated with plasma AD biomarker outcomes. Ethnicity appears to modulate these associations, suggesting complex interactions between factors driving AD susceptibility across diverse populations. This study highlights the importance of considering both pIQ and ethnicity in neurodegenerative processes, particularly in individuals with non-DS intellectual developmental disability.",J Alzheimers Dis
40076944,Blood Biomarkers Reflect Dementia Symptoms and Are Influenced by Cerebrovascular Lesions.,"Dementia blood biomarkers are becoming increasingly important. Various factors, such as ischemic lesions and inflammation, can influence the pathomechanism of dementia. We aimed to evaluate the effects of past stroke lesions on blood biomarkers (BMs). Following approval from the institutional ethics committee, patients who were admitted to the memory clinic and were consented to written documents were enrolled (n = 111, average [standard deviation] age: 74.5 [9.1] years-old). Brain magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive function, and neuropsychological symptoms were analyzed. The amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42)/Aβ40 ratio, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and Aβ42/p-tau181 ratio were assessed as plasma BMs. The patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (n = 45), mild cognitive impairment (n = 56), depression (n = 8), and subjective cognitive impairment (n = 4). Bivariate analysis exhibited that all measured BM indicators were significantly associated with cognitive decline in patients without past stroke lesions. Whereas the patients with stroke lesions presented a significant association only between GFAP and cognitive decline (p = 0.0011). Multiple regression analysis showed that NfL significantly correlated with cognitive decline only in patients without stroke lesions (r = 0.4988, p = 0.0003) and with delusion only in those with stroke lesions (r = 0.5492, p = 0.0121). Past stroke lesions should be addressed in the assessment of the correlation between blood biomarkers and cognitive decline in dementia patients.",Int J Mol Sci
40024764,Protocol for a Survey on the Impact of Caring for a Relative With Dementia on Caregivers' Health and Work Functioning.,"With the increasing incidence of dementia in Japan due to an aging population and declining birthrate, supporting family caregivers is crucial. A survey was conducted at the hospital of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan from October 1, 2021, to February 29, 2024, involving dementia patients and their working caregiver relatives. The survey assessed health, living, work, caregiving status, sociodemographic factors, and the care recipient's condition. A total of 214 patient-caregiver pairs participated; consent was obtained from 212 pairs, and data were collected from 166 caregivers. The caregivers were predominantly women, with 54 (33%) male caregivers and a mean age of 54.7 years. Health status was reported as good (33%) or fair (50%); however, 46% experienced sleep disturbances, 44% had psychological distress, 18% reported work dysfunction, and 8% noted poor social adjustment. Most of the care recipients were women (65%), with a mean age of 79.8 years. The most common diagnoses were mild cognitive impairment (37%) and Alzheimer's disease (35%), with an average mini-mental state examination score of 21.6. This study outlines the survey protocol, focusing on the health, work, and caregiving conditions of working relatives caring for dementia patients.",J UOEH
40146632,d-amino acids: new functional insights.,"The d-enantiomers of amino acids (d-AAs) were initially considered ""unnatural"" molecules. They are primarily of microbial origin, present in low amounts, and without biological functions in eukaryotes. However, over the past few decades, sensitive analytical methods have uncovered the presence of both free and peptide-bound d-AAs in higher organisms. During the same period, the discovery of serine racemase-the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible formation of d-serine from l-serine-in rat brains demonstrated that mammals synthesize d-AAs. Notably, the enzymes responsible for d-AAs catabolism were identified almost 90 years ago. Subsequently, free d-AAs such as d-serine, d-aspartate, d-alanine, and d-cysteine have emerged as a novel and important class of signaling molecules in various organs, including the brain and endocrine system. Their involvement in a wide range of neurological disorders has drawn significant scientific interest. We have focused on novel findings, based on the latest analytical techniques, that have reshaped our understanding of physiological processes across diverse organisms, from plants to humans. Beyond neurotransmission, recent studies have highlighted the versatile roles of d-AAs in cancer, inflammation, immune regulation, kidney disease, and diabetes. Moreover, these studies suggest that the levels of d-AAs in blood and urine could serve as early biomarkers for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and chronic kidney disease. Understanding the role of d-AAs in certain pathological states is helping to identify new therapeutic targets, offering promising opportunities for clinical applications in treating various diseases.",FEBS J
40015753,"Effects of the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative early detection of cognitive impairment program on clinician attitudes, engagement, and confidence.","BACKGROUND: The number of people with dementia is expected to grow substantially across the world due to population aging, but cognitive impairment remains undetected and undiagnosed, especially in early stages. Newly available diagnostic tools such as digital cognitive assessments and blood biomarker tests may be well suited to increase the rates of early detection of dementia in primary care.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the Davos Alzheimer's Collaborative Healthcare System Preparedness (DAC-SP) Early Detection Flagship Program was to improve the rate of early detection of cognitive impairment in primary care and non-specialty settings. We aimed to understand the program's impact on clinician attitudes, engagement, and confidence in diagnosing and managing cognitive impairment.
DESIGN: Survey of participating healthcare professionals before and after the intervention.
SETTING: The DAC Healthcare System Preparedness Early Detection Flagship Program was implemented in seven sites across six countries: Brazil, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Scotland, and the United States (2 sites).
PARTICIPANTS: 110 healthcare professionals, including, primary care physicians, specialists (neurologists and psychologists), nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, and healthcare support workers completed the pre-intervention survey. 68 healthcare professionals completed the post-intervention survey.
INTERVENTION: Participating sites implemented a digital cognitive assessment tool and a blood biomarker test for the Alzheimer's pathology and were trained in the administration of the digital cognitive assessment tool. The intervention was adapted to each site for cultural relevance and operational feasibility.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed the General Practitioners Attitude and Confidence Scale for Dementia (GPACS-D), a 15-item scale with three subscales: Attitude to Care (six items), Confidence in Clinical Abilities (six items), and Engagement (three items). In addition to the subscale scores, the total GPACS-D score was reported.
RESULTS: Across all sites, there was a significant increase in the Confidence in Clinical Abilities score from 2.98 (SD = 0.77) pre-intervention to 3.27 (SD = 0.72) post-intervention (p = 0.01), and in the total GPACS-D score from 3.48 (SD = 0.48) to 3.65 (SD = 0.39) (p = 0.01). There were non-significant increases in the Attitude to Care and Engagement scores across all sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of digital cognitive assessment tools and a blood biomarker test was associated with an increase in healthcare professionals' confidence in diagnosing and managing patients with cognitive impairment in primary care and non-specialty settings. Digital cognitive assessments and blood biomarker tests are promising tools that could be utilized in primary care to increase clinicians' confidence in detecting dementia and lead to timely clinical evaluation, treatment, and referral to supportive resources.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
39980585,Effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on cognitive functioning and the expression of APP and BDNF in the hippocampus of rats with streptozotocin -induced Alzheimer-like disease.,"We aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of the active substance of green tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on behavioral phenotypes and markers of neurogenesis in an Alzheimer disease (AD) rat model. The groups included sham, AD, and three AD groups receiving orally EGCG with different doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg. The AD model was induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozocin (STZ) at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Real-time PCR assay was used for evaluating the expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of animals. STZ disrupted the function of animals in MWM acquisition phase by almost 65 % and all doses of EGCG could return the learning parameters to those of control animals. STZ also impaired the memory function (P < 0.05) and a dose of 25 mg/kg EGCG could significantly return it to the control level (29 % vs 53 %, P < 0.01). Hippocampal APP gene expression was increased in the AD group and EGCG with dose 25 mg/kg decreased it significantly (P < 0.05). AD animals had decreased levels of hippocampal BDNF and treating with dose 25 mg/kg of EGCG could significantly increase it (P < 0.05). EGCG with dose 25 mg/kg can improve spatial memory deficits in AD model rats. It may be due to the impact on the expression of hippocampal factors involved in AD pathology. These findings could provide a beneficial insight for developing novel, safe, and efficient natural compounds for preventing or alleviation AD symptoms in humans.",Biochem Biophys Rep
40149988,Neuroprotective Properties of Clove (Syzygium aromaticum): State of the Art and Future Pharmaceutical Applications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"This study explores the neuropharmacological potential of various molecular and amino acid components derived from Syzygium aromaticum (clove), an aromatic spice with a long history of culinary and medicinal use. Key bioactive compounds such as eugenol, α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, gallic acid, quercetin, and luteolin demonstrate antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties by scavenging free radicals, modulating calcium channels, and reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, gallic acid and asiatic acid may exhibit protective effects, including neuronal apoptosis inhibition, while other useful properties of clove phytocompounds include NF-κB pathway inhibition, membrane stabilization, and suppression of pro-inflammatory pathways, possibly in neurons or other relevant cell types, further contributing to neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement. Amino acid analysis revealed essential and non-essential amino acids such as aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, and arginine in various clove parts (buds, fruits, branches, and leaves). These amino acids play crucial roles in neurotransmitter synthesis, immune modulation, antioxidant defense, and metabolic regulation. Collectively, these bioactive molecules and amino acids contribute to clove's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neurotrophic, and neurotransmitter-modulating effects, highlighting its potential as a preventive and therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative disorders. While preliminary preclinical studies support these neuroprotective properties, further research, including clinical trials, is needed to validate the efficacy and safety of clove-based interventions in neuroprotection.",Biomolecules
40083151,Connectomics and neurotransmitter receptor profile explain regional tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease tau pathology spreads through neuronal pathways and synaptic connections. Alteration in synaptic activity facilitates tau spreading. Multiple neurotransmitter systems are shown to be implicated in Alzheimer's disease, but their influence on the trans-synaptic spread of tau is not well understood. I aimed to combine resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomics, neurotransmitter receptor profiles, and tau-PET data to explain the regional susceptibility to tau accumulation. The tau-PET imaging data of 161 amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired participants as control and 259 amyloid-beta-positive subjects were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Linear regression analysis revealed that a higher tau-PET z-score is associated with a lower density of nine receptors in the serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, and glutamate systems. Furthermore, adding four neurotransmitter receptor density z-scores significantly increased the proportion of explained variance by 3% to 7% compared to the epicenter-connectivity distance model in the group-level analysis. Also, adding nine neurotransmitter receptor density z-scores to the epicenter-connectivity distance model increased the explanatory power of variability in individual levels of tau-PET z-score by 3% to 8%. The current study demonstrated the additive value of atlas-based neurotransmitter receptor mapping and individual-level amyloid-beta-PET scans to enhance the connectivity-based explanation of tau accumulation.",Cereb Cortex
40064795,Associations of plasma Neurofilament light chain with sarcopenia and physical capacity in patients with Alzheimer's diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the close association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with muscle decline, the biomarkers of age-related muscle loss, termed sarcopenia, in AD remain elusive.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the plasma neurofilament light (NfL) chain levels as potential biomarkers of sarcopenia in AD patients. DESIGN SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on older adults, including controls and patients with AD (n = 38-44/group). We measured the frequency of sarcopenia, body composition, handgrip strength (HGS), gait speed, and short physical performance battery (SPPB) in the study participants. We also measured the plasma NfL levels as marker of neurodegeneration.
RESULTS: AD was associated with a higher frequency of sarcopenia and reduced HGS, gait speed, and SPPB scores (all p < 0.05). The higher plasma NfL levels in AD patients were correlated with lower HGS, gait speed, and SPPB scores (all p < 0.05). Plasma NfL exhibited moderate accuracy in diagnosing sarcopenia (area under the curve; AUC = 0.701, p < 0.001) and functional dependency (AUC = 0.772, p < 0.001). Among different subgroups of AD, moderate AD was associated with more advanced sarcopenia and functional dependency than early and mild AD. Patients with AD also exhibited heightened inflammation and oxidative stress.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, plasma NfL may be a preliminary tool in diagnosing advanced sarcopenia and functional dependency in AD. The study is relevant to non-ambulant and/or comatose AD patients with sarcopenia.",Acta Neurol Belg
40156282,Primary care preparedness to care for patients with ADRD: A national survey study.,"INTRODUCTION: It is unknown how prepared primary care practices are to deliver recommended dementia care.
METHODS: A nationally representative survey of US primary care practices focused on care delivery processes, including those for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
RESULTS: A total of 1245 of 3498 practices (36%) responded. Most practices reported systems to detect patients with ADRD (67%) and refer patients for diagnostic testing (75%). Fewer required ADRD-related training (45%-46%) or maintained an ADRD registry (29%). Practices that scored higher on ADRD care preparedness were more likely to be smaller, receive a higher proportion of revenue from Medicare, and have other important practice capabilities.
DISCUSSION: Primary care practices have mixed preparedness to care for patients with ADRD. Efforts to boost ADRD preparedness, including providing adequate infrastructure and resources directly to primary care, should be a priority to address disparities in diagnosis and to optimize the patient and caregiver journey.
HIGHLIGHTS: Mixed ADRD preparedness identified in primary care practices across the United States. Practices often lack ADRD-specific registries and staff training initiatives. Medicare-reliant and larger physician-owned groups show higher ADRD preparedness. FQHCs reported lower ADRD preparedness, highlighting potential gaps in care. Cultural awareness and other support services correlate with better ADRD readiness.",Alzheimers Dement
40034504,How follow-up period in prospective cohort studies affects the relationship between baseline fish consumption and risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Diet plays an important role in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is regarded as one way to reduce risk. Fish is a component of the Mediterranean diet. Participant variables change with time, resulting in ""regression dilution"".
OBJECTIVE: The objective is to investigate the role of follow-up period after measurement of dietary fish intake with risk of AD and dementia.
METHODS: A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies is used to examine this effect for dietary fish and incidence of dementia and AD.
RESULTS: For seven dementia studies with mean follow-up periods from one to ten years, the regression fit to the data is relative risk (RR) = 0.19 + (0.087 × Follow up [years], r = 0.84, adjusted r<sup>2 </sup> = 0.66, p = 0.009). However, when mean age of the participants was added to the analysis, the effect of follow-up period became non-significant. For five AD studies with follow-up periods from 3.9 to 9.8 years, the regression fit to the data is RR = 0.11 + (0.095 × follow up [years]), r = 0.93, adjusted r<sup>2 </sup> = 0.87, p = 0.02). The RR for the regression fit to the shortest follow-up periods are 40% greater for dementia than the standard meta-analysis suggests and 70% greater for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Prospective cohort studies of diet and health outcomes should reassess variables every few years. Meta-analyses should consider the effect of mean follow-up periods and mean age of the participants during follow up.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

This research work presents the design, synthesis, and characterization of novel imidazotriazole-based thiazolidinone derivatives (1-14), displaying promising anti-Alzheimer's activity. Methods: These derivatives were synthesized by using 1H-imidazole-2-thiol as a starting reagent. Structural characterization was accomplished by <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, while the molecular weight was confirmed by HREI-MS. These compounds were investigated for their anti-Alzheimer's potential under an in vitro analysis. Results: These compounds showed a significant to moderate biological potential against AChE and BChE in comparison to donepezil (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.50 µM and 8.90 µM against AChE and BuChE), used as a reference drug. Among these compounds, analog 10 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.70 µM and 7.10 µM against AChE and BuChE emerged as the lead compound of the series with promising biological efficacy against targeted enzymes. Molecular docking revealed the interactive nature of active ligands against target enzymes. These compounds were also assessed under dynamic conditions to examine the structural deviation and conformational changes in a protein complex structure. DFT calculations provided the relative stability and reactivity of the lead compounds. An ADMET analysis showed that these compounds have no toxicological profile.

Sections of the hippocampus of the Long Evans Cohen's AD(+) rat model were mixed with gold colloids and the resulting aggregates were examined by Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) imaging. Compared to AD(-) rat tissues, the AD(+) rat hippocampal tissues produced a larger sized gold colloid aggregates. The SERS spectrum of each hippocampal section exhibited similar spectral patterns in the Amide I, II, and III band regions, but showed distinct spectral patterns in the region between 300 cm<sup>-1</sup> - 1250 cm<sup>-1</sup> in AD(+) rat tissues, respectively. Amyloid fibrils with a β-sheet conformation were previously reported to form gold colloid aggregates in mouse and human AD brain tissues. The gold colloid aggregates in the AD (+) rat hippocampal brain sections showed distinct morphological traits compared to those observed in AD(-) rats. This suggests that there is a spatial distribution of oligomer concentration in the hippocampus, which induces fibril formation to disrupt neuronal networks within the hippocampus and between other parts of the brain.",Neurosci Lett
40084044,A bibliometric analysis of research hotspots and trends in transcranial magnetic stimulation and Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Research regarding Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasing; however, no bibliometric analysis has yet been conducted in this domain. This study employs bibliometric methods to identify research trends and hotspots concerning AD and TMS.
METHODS: We conducted a search in the Web of Science Core Database for articles related to AD and TMS from January 1, 2014, to October 22, 2024. After stringent selection, we performed bibliometric analysis using Excel, VOSviewer, CiteSpace and CoreMine.
RESULTS: The number of articles pertaining to AD and TMS has increased annually, with a notable surge post-2020. The three leading countries in publication volume are China, the United States, and Italy. The top institutions contributing to this field include Harvard Medical School, the University of Toronto, and the University of Brescia. The author with the highest publication output is Giacomo Koch. The journal with the most publications is the Journal of Alzheimer's disease. The 10 most frequently occurring keywords are Alzheimer's disease, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, memory, double-blind, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, noninvasive brain stimulation, cognitive impairment, and plasticity. Text mining has revealed that the anatomical structure ""brain"" and the gene ""Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)"" are significantly related to both AD and TMS, suggesting that TMS may offer a therapeutic avenue for AD by modulating the activity of APP.

40090428,Multi-target activity of ethanolic extract of Crinum woodrowii Baker for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease affecting mental ability and neurocognitive functions. Crinum woodrowii Baker (C. woodrowii) is an endemic plant with significant ethnobotanical potential against neurological and inflammatory conditions with a characteristic improvement of cognitive functions.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the anti-AD potential of C. woodrowii extract through in-vitro assays and preclinical in-vivo screening and to validate its neuroprotective effect by biochemical and histopathological analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, galantamine contents of the ethanolic extract of C. woodrowii were quantified using HPLC and LCMS. Further, the extract was examined for in-vitro cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory, anti-cholinesterase activities, and in-vivo neuropharmacological studies.
RESULTS: The extract exhibited low cytotoxicity on RAW 264.7 cells and the inhibition of LPS-induced nitric oxide production. The extract also showed anti-cholinesterase activities. The treatment with extract significantly rescued the rough eye phenotype in the Drosophila model of AD. In neuropharmacological screening, the extract showed no symptoms of acute oral toxicity in rats. The extract significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice and improved their learning ability with memory retention in exteroceptive behavioral models. The pretreatment of mice with extract reinstated the elevated brain acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione levels due to scopolamine and aging. The extract also restored the altered superoxide dismutase and catalase levels. The extract alleviated neuronal tissue damage caused by the scopolamine, as indicated by the histological analyses of the brain.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that the C. woodrowii extract has neuroprotective properties and ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and hence could be explored further as a potential neurotherapeutics for treating AD.",J Ethnopharmacol
40094842,Oral Health Status and Factors Associated with Oral Health in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Matched Case-Control Observational Study.,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, ranking as the seventh leading cause of death in both sexes. There is increasing awareness of the role of chronic periodontal disease and severe tooth loss as a modifiable risk factor for developing AD. The aim of the present observational study was to assess AD patients with non-affected healthy controls in the context of their dental and periodontal health outcomes; additionally, the potential impact of anamnestic factors and lifestyle habits on oral health outcomes was also studied. Methods: A total of n = 41 AD patients receiving treatment at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Szeged, were compared with n = 41 age- and gender-matched controls from individuals seeking dental treatment and from retirement homes (mean age was 83.32 ± 7.82 years). Dental and periodontal status indices were assessed according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results: Overall, 51.2%, 68.3%, and 87.8% of AD patients received mood stabilizers, drugs for their non-cognitive symptoms and cognitive symptoms, respectively. Severe tooth loss was observed in 43.9% of AD patients and 56.1% of controls, respectively. There were no significant differences among AD patients and controls regarding the dental status indices studied (p &gt; 0.05 for all indicators). AD patients had significantly higher plaque indices (%) (59.06 ± 15.45 vs. 41.35 ± 7.97; p &lt; 0.001), bleeding on probing (BOP%) (62.65 ± 12.00 vs. 40.12 ± 10.86; p &lt; 0.001), pocket depth [PD] (2.63 ± 0.56 vs. 2.29 ± 0.13; p = 0.002) and attachment loss [AL] (2.85 ± 0.79 vs. 2.39 ± 0.41; p = 0.026) values, compared to controls.

In contrast, coffee intake and vitamin supplement use had no significant effect on dental or periodontal status parameters (p &gt; 0.05 in all cases). Conclusions: The results of our study underscore the substantial treatment needs of AD patients, calling for heightened awareness among dental healthcare professionals.",J Clin Med
40129664,"Ketogenic diet, adenosine, and dopamine in addiction and psychiatry.","Adhering to the ketogenic diet can reduce or stop seizures, even when other treatments fail, via mechanism(s) distinct from other available therapies. These results have led to interest in the diet for treating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. Evidence points to the neuromodulator adenosine as a key mechanism underlying therapeutic benefits of a ketogenic diet. Adenosine represents a unique and direct link among cell energy, neuronal activity, and gene expression, and adenosine receptors form functional heteromers with dopamine receptors. The importance of the dopaminergic system is established in addiction, as are the challenges of modulating the dopamine system directly. A mediator that could antagonize dopamine's effects would be useful, and adenosine is such a mediator due to its function and location. Studies report that the ketogenic diet improves cognition, sociability, and perseverative behaviors, and might improve depression. Many of the translational opportunities based on the ketogenic diet/adenosine link have come to the fore, including addiction, autism spectrum disorder, painful conditions, and a range of hyperdopaminergic disorders.",Front Nutr

We review the available screening tools for the diagnosis of dementia. We discuss how the diagnosis of dementia differs from the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and also detail how delirium and depression can mimic dementia. In terms of treatments for dementia, we highlight four components. First, we describe pharmacological treatments for the management of dementia, including the cholinesterase inhibitors, NDMA antagonists, as well as the newer anti-amyloid antibody drugs for Alzheimer's dementia. Second, we discuss the importance of nonpharmacological interventions for the management of dementia, especially exercise. Third, we review approaches for the behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia, including potential medication management.

39982263,Long-Term Insomnia Treatment with Benzodiazepines and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Benzodiazepines are the most widely used pharmacological class in the treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders. Some literature suggests that the chronic use of benzodiazepines is associated with the development of cognitive decline. This review aims to evaluate the use of benzodiazepines and its association with the development of Alzheimer's disease. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Protocols followed the PRISMA-P 2020 methodology, and, after the analysis of the included studies, a narrative synthesis of the results was carried out. Only two cohort studies were identified that met defined eligibility criteria. In the retrospective study, a significant risk of developing Alzheimer's disease after treatment with benzodiazepines was found. In the prospective study, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was not associated with treatment with benzodiazepines. Results suggest that only the largest study presented a significant risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Given the scarce scientific evidence found, it is concluded that further research on this topic is necessary.",NeuroSci
40151148,Glucose uptake in pigment glia suppresses tau-induced inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration in Drosophila.,"Brain inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human Tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of the lamina cortex. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with Tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.",Dis Model Mech
39975899,"Isotope Encoded Spatial Biology Identifies Amyloid Plaque-Age-Dependent Structural Maturation, Synaptic Loss, and Increased Toxicity.","Understanding how amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques form and progress to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease remains a significant challenge. This study aims to elucidate the processes involved in Aβ plaque formation and maturation using a knock-in Aβ mouse model (App <sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> ). By employing mass spectrometry imaging and stable isotope labeling, we timestamped Aβ plaques from their initial deposition, enabling the spatial tracking of plaque aging. Correlating single-plaque spatial transcriptomics with time since seeding, allowed us to track gene-expression changes specifically associated with plaque age, independent of chronological age of the mouse or disease severity. We found that plaque age, within sections from individual mice aged from 10 to 18 months, negatively correlates with synaptic gene expression. Further, correlation with hyperspectral confocal microscopy using structure-specific dyes revealed a positive link between plaque age and structural maturity, with older plaques identified as more compact and associated with significantly greater synapse loss and toxicity.",Res Sq

This study aimed to assess the knowledge of AD among healthcare professionals working in government hospitals and healthcare centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire to assess Alzheimer's disease knowledge using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). Participants also self-rated their knowledge and reported their experience in dementia care and training. The study included 231 healthcare professionals, with 61.5% males and 38.5% females. Medical professionals demonstrated significantly higher mean ADKS score = 19.84 compared to pharmacy, nursing, and allied health professionals (P < .05). Other factors, such as gender, age, workplace setting, years of experience, and formal dementia training, showed no significant impact on ADKS scores (P > .05). However, participants with additional dementia-related learning experiences, such as workshops or self-directed study, had significantly higher scores (P < .05). A notable finding was the discrepancy between self-assessed and actual knowledge. Among those who rated themselves as ""very knowledgeable,"" only 10% achieved a very good ADKS score, while more than half failed the test. Conversely, those who rated themselves as having poor knowledge often performed better than expected, with many achieving good or very good ADKS scores 44.3% and 13.1%, respectively. This study highlights significant disparities in Alzheimer's disease knowledge among healthcare professionals in Jeddah, with medical staff showing higher understanding. Tailored educational programs are needed to address these gaps and improve dementia care.",Medicine (Baltimore)
40122980,Generalizability of trial criteria on amyloid-lowering therapy against Alzheimer's disease to individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease in the general population.,"Treatment with anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies slowed cognitive decline in recent RCTs in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, stringent trial eligibility criteria may affect generalisability to clinical practice. We extracted eligibility criteria for trials of aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab, and applied these to participants with MCI and early clinical AD dementia from the population-based Rotterdam Study. Participants underwent questionnaires, genotyping, brain-MRI, cognitive testing, and cardiovascular assessment. We determined amyloid status using a validated prediction model based on age and APOE-genotype. Of 968 participants (mean age: 75 years, 56% women), 779 had MCI and 189 dementia. Across trials, around 40% of participants would be ineligible because of predicted amyloid negativity. At least one clinical exclusion criterion was present in 76.3% of participants for aducanumab, 75.8% for lecanemab, and 59.8% for donanemab. Common criteria were cardiovascular disease (35.2%), anticoagulant (31.2%), psychotropic or immunological medication use (20.4%), anxiety or depression (15.9%), or lack of social support (15.6%). One-third were ineligible based on brain-MRI findings alone, similar across trials and predominantly due to cerebral small-vessel disease. Combining amyloid, clinical, and imaging criteria, eligibility ranged from 9% (95% CI:7.0-11.1) for aducanumab, 8% (6.2-9.9) lecanemab to 15% (12.4-17.5) for donanemab. Findings from recent RCTs reporting protective effects of monoclonal antibodies against amyloid-β are applicable to less than 15% of community-dwelling individuals with MCI or early AD. These findings underline that evidence for drug efficacy and safety is lacking for the vast majority of patients with MCI/AD in routine clinical practice.",Eur J Epidemiol
40031499,Impairments in Spatial Representations of Place Cells and Neural rhythms In APP knock-in rat model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that severely impacts spatial memory. Place cells in the hippocampus play an important role in spatial memory. However, neuronal activity in the hippocampus is difficult to monitor and study in human AD patients. Thus, it is critical to have an animal model that resembles closely human AD. The newly developed APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> rat model, which is a knock-in rat line of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with Swedish-Beyreuther/Iberian-Arctic mutations, presents a unique opportunity. In this study, we investigated how hippocampal place cells and neural rhythms were impaired in APP rats. Place cells of APP rats showed a less defined spatial tunning and disrupted remapping. In addition, APP rats exhibited decreased power of theta rhythm and slow gamma rhythm. These results suggest that the impairment of spatial memory in APP rats may be caused by the damage of place cells' ability to represent spatial location and abnormal neural rhythm in the hippocampus.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40128823,Retrotransposon: an insight into neurological disorders from perspectives of neurodevelopment and aging.,"Neurological disorders present considerable challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their complex and diverse etiology. Retrotransposons are a type of mobile genetic element that are increasingly revealed to play a role in these diseases. This review provides a detailed overview of recent developments in the study of retrotransposons in neurodevelopment, neuroaging, and neurological diseases. Retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear elements-1, Alu, SINE-VNTR-Alu, and endogenous retrovirus, play important regulatory roles in the development and aging of the nervous system. They have also been implicated in the pathological processes of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.

40126150,Utilizing Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy to Improve Cognitive Function in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease by Activating Autophagy-Related Signaling Pathways.,"To investigate the impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the cognitive function of mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while also identifying the cellular pathways associated with autophagy involved in the treatment. Twenty-four APP/PSl double transgenic mice were randomly assigned to either Group A or Group B, while another 24 C57 mice were randomly allocated to Group C or Group D. HBOT was administered to mice in Group B and Group D, and the Morris water maze test was used to assess changes in mice behavior. Histological examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to observe pathological alterations in the hippocampus of the mice brain tissue. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to analyze autophagy-related gene pathways in the hippocampus of the mice. Following HBOT, mice in Group B exhibited a significant reduction in escape latency and a notable increase in residence time within the target quadrant compared with Group A (P<0.05), as well as Group C and Group D (P<0.01). The hippocampal neurons in Group A and Group B mice exhibited disorganized arrangements, characterized by pyknosis and margination. Conversely, neurons in Group C displayed orderly arrangements, retaining intact structures with round nuclei demonstrating clear nuclear staining and normal morphology. The cellular morphology of mice in Group D remained unaffected. PCR analysis revealed no notable disparity in autophagy-related gene expression between Group A and Group C. However, the expression levels of five genes including Tgfb1, Mapk14, Bid, Atg7, and Akt1, were significantly elevated in Group B compared to Group A. HBOT has the potential to improve the cognitive function in mice modeled with AD. This improvement of cognitive function appears to be mediated by the up-regulation of autophagy-related genes, specifically Tgfb1, Mapk14, Bid, Atg7, and Akt1. These results indicate that HBOT may offer a therapeutic strategy for treating AD by enhancing autophagy mechanisms.

The molecularly imprinted microspheres based on chitosan were fabricated to adsorb selectively, release and anti-bacteria of Ber. The Ber surface molecularly imprinted microspheres (Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs) were synthesized using crosslinked chitosan as matrix, Ber as template, and sodium 4-styrene sulfonate (SSS) as functional monomer via a redox surface-initiating system -NH<sub>2</sub>/-S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The microspheres were characterized by fourier transform infrared reflection (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Adsorption kinetics, isotherms and imprinting factor were investigated, and the drug release performance and antibacterial activity were evaluated. As a result, via electrostatic interaction and ""lock-key"" imprinted cavities, the adsorption capacity of Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs reaches 185 mg/g at 2 h, significantly higher than 51 mg/g observed for non-imprinted microspheres. The adsorption of Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs. follows pseudo-second-order kinetics, with adsorption amount decreasing as temperature increases and salt concentration rises. Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs show excellent recognition and selectivity with an imprinting factor of 3.07, a selectivity factor exceeding to 2. The adsorption capacity remains at 82.4 % of three times cycles. The Ber-PSSS@GCS-MIPs loaded drug microspheres attain slow and sustained release for 70 % at 139 h.

40109019,Tau degradation in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau undergoes abnormal post-translational modifications and aggregations. Impaired intracellular degradation pathways further exacerbate the accumulation of pathological tau. A new strategy - targeted protein degradation - recently emerged as a modality in drug discovery where bifunctional molecules bring the target protein close to the degradation machinery to promote clearance. Since 2016, this strategy has been applied to tau pathologies and attracted broad interest in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. However, a systematic review of recent studies on tau degradation mechanisms is lacking. Here we review tau degradation mechanisms (the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway), their dysfunction in AD, and tau-targeted degraders, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras and autophagy-targeting chimeras. We emphasize the need for a continuous exploration of tau degradation mechanisms and provide a future perspective for developing tau-targeted degraders, encouraging researchers to work on new treatment options for AD patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Post-translational modifications, aggregation, and mutations affect tau degradation. A vicious circle exists between impaired degradation pathways and tau pathologies. Ubiquitin plays an important role in complex degradation pathways. Tau-targeted degraders provide promising strategies for novel AD treatment.",Alzheimers Dement
40159850,Rational Design of the First Dual Agonist at Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> Receptors Based on Binding Pocket Similarity for the Treatment of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Psychosis.,"The clinical-stage agonists for trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) show insufficient clinical efficacy, requiring the design of new compounds beyond the TAAR1 receptor alone. Here, we provide evidence for the feasibility of designing TAAR1/5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R dual agonists based on structural basis of these two targets and similarities of their agonists. Three series of novel agonists were discovered, leading to a potent compound named 21b. 21b exhibits submicromolar potency on both TAAR1 and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R targets with high specificity confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Preclinical proof-of-concept studies showed that 21b was highly efficacious against the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia in mice models. 21b also alleviated cognitive deficits and psychoactive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. Four week repeated dosing of 21b is exceptionally well tolerated in rats and beagle dogs without hyperglycemia commonly seen with antipsychotics. Thus, the favorable druggability of compound 21b warrants further clinical development for the treatment of schizophrenia and AD-related psychosis.",J Med Chem
40002308,Inflammasomes in Alzheimer's Progression: Nrf2 as a Preventive Target.,"Current knowledge about Alzheimer's disease highlights the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques (Aβ1-42) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau, which lead to the loss of neuronal connections. Microglial activation and the release of inflammatory mediators play a significant role in the progression of Alzheimer's pathology. Recent advances have identified the involvement of inflammasomes, particularly NOD-like receptor NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), whose activation promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines and triggers pyroptosis, exacerbating neuroinflammation. Aggregates of Aβ1-42 and hyperphosphorylated Tau have been shown to activate these inflammasomes, while the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) components form aggregates that further accelerate Aβ aggregation. Defects in the autophagic clearance of inflammasomes have also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, contributing to sustained inflammation. This review explores strategies to counteract inflammation in Alzheimer's, emphasizing the degradation of ASC specks and the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor emerges as a promising therapeutic target due to its dual role in mitigating oxidative stress and directly inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome formation. By reducing inflammasome-driven inflammation, Nrf2 offers significant potential for addressing the neuroinflammatory aspects of Alzheimer's disease.",Antioxidants (Basel)
40015756,"Social isolation, loneliness, and their joint effects on cognitive decline and incident Alzheimer's disease: Findings from the Chicago health and aging project.","BACKGROUND: There has been contradictory evidence on the prospective associations between social isolation/loneliness (SI/L) and cognitive decline (CD). There is also a scarcity of large and diverse population-based cohort studies examining SI/L that have confirmed clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Notably, beyond individual associations, whether the effects of SI/L compound and accelerate CD and incident AD are not known.
OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that SI and L, independently, would be associated with CD and incident AD to a similar extent, and the association of SI with CD and incident AD would be higher in lonely older adults.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Urban Chicago areas.
PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data in the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), which comprised 7,760 biracial community-dwelling older adults [mean age (standard deviation (SD))=72.3 (6.3); 64 % Black & 63 % women; mean (SD) of follow-up=7.9 (4.3) years].
INTERVENTION (IF ANY): NA MEASUREMENTS: Linear mixed and logistic regression models were used to regress CD and incident AD separately on the SI index/L.
RESULTS: SI index and L were significantly associated with CD, with one-point increase of beta estimate (SE, p-value) = -0.002 (0.001,0.022) and -0.012 (0.003,<0.001), respectively. Given that the SI index ranges from 0 to 5 and the L from 0 to 1, they had similar effect sizes. Similarly, there were significant associations between SI index and incident AD, odds ratio (95 % CI, p-value) = 1.183 (1.016-1.379,0.029), and between L and incident AD, 2.117 (1.227-3.655,0.006). When stratified by loneliness status, compared to older adults who were not isolated and not lonely, older adults who reported being socially isolated and not lonely experienced accelerated CD, -0.003 (0.001,0.004), despite no significantly increased odds of incident AD.
CONCLUSIONS: SI/L had significant associations with CD and incident AD. Notably, socially isolated older adults who reported not being lonely appeared to be most socially vulnerable to CD. These findings suggest a specific at-risk subgroup of socially vulnerable older adults for future targeted interventions to improve cognitive health.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40076984,Revealing Lingonberry's Neuroprotective Potential in Alzheimer's Disease Through Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) has demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease. Pathway analysis identified monoamine oxidase B as a key target involved in serotonergic synapse dysfunction related to Alzheimer's disease. Molecular docking revealed that ferulic acid, a major bioactive compound in lingonberry, exhibits strong binding affinity to monoamine oxidase B. Further molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of this interaction, highlighting the potential inhibitory effect of ferulic acid on monoamine oxidase B. These findings provide novel insights into the neuroprotective mechanisms of lingonberry and suggest its potential as a natural therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease.",Int J Mol Sci
40013501,Bacteria in the brain: do they have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Worldwide efforts continue to unravel the complex pathological pathways that lead to Alzheimer's disease. The gut-brain-microbiome axis, a communication pathway between the gut, brain and microorganisms, is emerging as a potential mechanism involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. While the gut microbiome's role in Alzheimer's disease has gained significant attention, the brain microbiome remains relatively unexplored. This review summarizes the latest research on the brain microbiome in Alzheimer's disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 4 years, four out of five studies have found bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , in postmortem samples of both control and Alzheimer's disease brains, supporting the idea that the brain is not a sterile environment. Two studies report the overabundance of several bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria and Actinomycetes, in postmortem Alzheimer's disease brains versus controls. One study reported the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi in a subset of Alzheimer's disease cases compared to controls.
SUMMARY: Limitations and challenges persist in studying the brain microbiome, including the lack of standardized assays and data analysis methods, small sample sizes, and inconsistent use of controls for environmental microbial contamination during sample processing. Well designed studies that employ reproducible and rigorous methods are required to elucidate whether microbes are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",Curr Opin Psychiatry
40143721,Relationship Between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Cognitive Function in Methamphetamine-Dependent Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Methamphetamine (METH) is a neurotoxic substance that can induce neurodegeneration in the human brain. Consequently chronic METH use can affect the cognitive functions in METH-dependent patients. In this study, we aimed to identify the relationship between cognitive function and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which reflects the status of neuroadaptive changes, by characterizing the effects on the cognitive function of METH-dependent patients.
METHODS: A total of 38 METH-dependent patients participated in this study. BDNF levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also examined the clinical features based on the measurements of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Korean version (CERAD-K). Finally, the relationships between various parts of CERAD-K and BDNF were compared with one another.
RESULTS: METH-dependent patients were able to conduct most parts of CERAD-K stably. Among the parts of CERAD-K, only trail-making test part B was correlated with BDNF.
CONCLUSION: The trail-making test is specific for evaluating executive function; therefore, BDNF may play an essential role in detecting neurocognitive functional decline in METH dependence.",Psychiatry Investig
40040180,Dementia Detection by In-Text Pause Encoding.,"In dementia, particularly Alzheimer's Disease (AD), communication challenges are evident, especially in vocabulary and pragmatic aspects. Affected individuals often use vague, non-specific words, and their speech lacks informative nouns and verbs, leading to imprecise communication. However, aspects like sentence structure, phonology, and articulation are believed to remain intact until later stages, though this view is debated in the research community. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant strides in various domains, including sentiment analysis and question-answering. These advancements have been applied to dementia research, with studies using LLMs to analyze textual data. Some research incorporates pauses in text to enhance performance, while others utilize transfer learning techniques. However, limited datasets for dementia detection pose challenges in training LLMs. Our research presents a novel approach to measuring the impact of in-text encoding strategies by embedding special characters within the text to enhance model performance and incorporating sequences and summaries of their frequency.

Fifty-four Wistar rats (180-200g) were used for the study; thirty experimental rats were randomly grouped into five, each containing six rats designated A, B, C, D and E while twenty-four rats were used to establish 50% lethal dose (LD50). Alzheimer's type cognitive dysfunction was intraperitoneally (ip) induced with scopolamine hydrobromide (1mg/kg, ip) for seven days in groups B-E prior to the oral administration of the aqueous extract (875 and 1750mg/kg) and donepezil (1mg/kg), followed by the novel object recognition test, histological and GFAP staining processes. Results revealed atrophied pyramidal cells, hyperchromatic, numerous glial cells with pale cytoplasmic inclusions and astrogliosis in groups B, C, and E while group D showed ameliorative potentials compared to group A. Also, short term memory was significantly higher in group D compared to groups B, C and E. In conclusion, aqueous extract of Talinium triangulare leaves reduced the potentials of scopolamine hydrobromide by restoring abnormal neurons, hence, enhancing cognitive memory in the rats used in the present study.",Niger J Physiol Sci
40133250,Blood DNA methylation signature for incident dementia: Evidence from longitudinal cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Distinguishing between molecular changes that precede dementia onset and those resulting from the disease is challenging with cross-sectional studies.
METHODS: We studied blood DNA methylation (DNAm) differences and incident dementia in two large longitudinal cohorts: the Offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We analyzed blood DNAm samples from > 1000 cognitively unimpaired subjects.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis identified 44 CpGs and 44 differentially methylated regions consistently associated with time to dementia in both cohorts. Our integrative analysis identified early processes in dementia, such as immune responses and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we developed a methylation-based risk score, which successfully predicted future cognitive decline in an independent validation set, even after accounting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score.
DISCUSSION: DNAm offers a promising source as a biomarker for dementia risk assessment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood DNA methylation (DNAm) differences at individual CpGs and differentially methylated regions are significantly associated with incident dementia. Pathway analysis revealed DNAm differences associated with incident dementia are significantly enriched in biological pathways involved in immune responses and metabolic processes. Out-of-sample validation analysis demonstrated that a methylation-based risk score successfully predicted future cognitive decline in an independent dataset, even after accounting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score.",Alzheimers Dement
39994995,"The associations between attentional control, episodic memory, and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration.","BACKGROUND: While episodic memory decline is the most common cognitive symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD), changes in attentional control have also been found to be sensitive to early AD pathology. The relations between longitudinal trajectories of these specific cognitive domains, especially attentional control, and biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration have not been thoroughly examined.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether baseline tau positron emission tomography (PET) and cortical thickness, relatively later markers within the AD cascade, predicted cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in episodic memory and attentional control.
METHODS: Cognitively normal individuals ([Clinical Dementia Rating CDR<sup>®</sup>] = 0; n = 249) at baseline completed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tau PET, and multiple assessments of episodic memory and attentional control. Generalized additive mixed-effects models examined whether tau PET summary measure and cortical thickness signature predicted cross-sectional and longitudinal trajectories of attentional control and episodic memory.
RESULTS: Higher tau PET and lower MRI cortical thickness were generally associated with worse cross-sectional cognitive performance. Our exploratory analyses found cortex-wide associations between tau PET and episodic memory, with limited suggestions of region-specific associations with attentional control. On longitudinal follow-up, higher tau PET was associated with a greater decline in episodic memory.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that tau PET is particularly sensitive to detecting longitudinal changes in episodic memory. This further informs relevant endpoints for clinical drug trials in cognitively normal individuals. Future studies might consider longer follow-ups and lag associations between changes in AD biomarkers and changes in cognition.",J Alzheimers Dis
40119841,Causal Effects of Schooling on Memory at Older Ages in Six Low-and-Middle Income Countries: Nonparametric Evidence with Harmonized Datasets.,"OBJECTIVE: Higher schooling attainment is associated with better cognitive function at older ages, but it remains unclear whether the relationship is causal. We estimated causal effects of schooling on performances on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) word-recall (memory) test at older ages in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa.
METHODS: We used harmonized data (n = 30,896) on older adults (≥50 years) from the World Health Organization Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. We applied an established nonparametric partial-identification approach that bounds causal effects of increasing schooling attainment at different parts of the schooling distributions under relatively weak assumptions.
RESULTS: An additional year of schooling increased word-recall scores by between 0.01-0.13 standard deviations (SDs) in China, 0.01-0.06 SDs in Ghana, 0.02-0.09 SDs in India, 0.02-0.12 SDs in Mexico, and 0-0.07 SDs in South Africa when increasing schooling from never attended to primary. No results were obtained for Russia at this margin due to the low proportion of older adults with primary schooling or lower. At higher parts of the schooling distributions (e.g., high school or university completion) the bounds cannot statistically reject null effects.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that increasing schooling from never attended to primary had long-lasting effects on memory decades later in life for older adults in five diverse low-and-middle-income countries.",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci
40088886,Multi-cohort cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identifies robust molecular signatures across the Alzheimer disease continuum.,"Changes in β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precede Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, making the CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand disease pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies.

Of these, 865 (43%) were previously reported, and 1,164 (57%) are novel. The identified proteins cluster in four different pseudo-trajectories groups spanning the AD continuum and were enriched in pathways including neuronal death, apoptosis, and tau phosphorylation (early stages), microglia dysregulation and endolysosomal dysfunction (mid stages), brain plasticity and longevity (mid stages), and microglia-neuron crosstalk (late stages). Using machine learning, we created and validated highly accurate and replicable (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status.

40014836,Effect Modifiers of the Association of Blood Pressure With Brain Amyloid and Tau Pathology.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor of Alzheimer disease (AD), but previous studies reported heterogeneous associations of late-life blood pressure (BP) with brain amyloid and tau pathologies. We investigated how the associations of BP with brain amyloid and tau vary by APOE ε4 carriership, age, cerebrovascular burden, and cognitive status.
METHODS: We performed analyses among participants with postmortem neuropathology measurements (2005-June 2022) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. The average systolic BP (SBP) of the first 3 annual visits was the primary exposure, and baseline hypertension status was the secondary exposure. Brain AD pathologies were assessed using Thal and Braak staging. Potential modifiers included APOE ε4 carriership, age, stroke history, and cognitive status. Multinomial logistic regressions with interaction terms were used to test effect modification, adjusting for age, sex, APOE ε4 carriership, education, antihypertensive medication use, and years to death.
RESULTS: Among 2,094 participants (baseline age: 75 ± 9.5 years; 51.4% women), the association of higher SBP with higher amyloid and tau burdens varied by stroke history and cognitive status while the effect modification by age or APOE ε4 carriership was less consistent. More pronounced associations of SBP with higher amyloid and tau burdens were observed in those with dementia (vs without dementia) and those with a history of stroke (vs without stroke) (All p interaction&lt;0.05). The odds ratios (ORs) per 10-mm Hg increase in SBP in the stroke vs nonstroke subgroup were 1.58 (95% CI 1.04-2.41) vs 1.14 (1.03-1.27) for amyloid and 1.54 (1.00-2.36) vs 1.04 (0.96-1.12) for tau. When comparing dementia with cognitively normal subgroups, ORs were 1.39 (1.17-1.64) vs 1.12 (0.96-1.31) for amyloid and 1.24 (1.08-1.42) vs 0.98 (0.85-1.14) for tau. Similar findings were observed for baseline hypertension status.
DISCUSSION: Preexisting cerebrovascular burden and cognitive status might interact with elevated SBP in their association with higher brain amyloid and tau, which could help identify high-risk subgroups for BP management and AD prevention. These heterogeneous association patterns need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies with in vivo AD pathology assessments.",Neurology
40042228,Exercise Rescues Blood-Brain Barrier Structural Impairment and Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis in a Hypertensive Mouse Model.,"Purpose. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Over the past decades, numerous studies have suggested that exercise can mitigate neurodegenerative processes by improving mitochondrial function. Recently, we demonstrated that exercise could reverse hippocampus-associated memory deficits and reduce BBB leakage in a modified two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive animal model. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that exercise restores BBB integrity in hypertensive animal models. Methods. Hypertension was induced in C57BL/6 mice via 2K1C surgery. Following three weeks of hypertension induction, mice underwent moderate-intensity treadmill exercise for five weeks. Subsequently, brain tissues were collected for immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting analyses to assess changes in BBB structure and mitochondria-related protein expression. Results. Exercise restored hypertension-induced reductions in blood vessel density within the hippocampus. Additionally, it repaired BBB structural impairments, as evidenced by increased levels of Claudin-5 co-localization with blood vessels, enhanced perivascular astrocyte levels, and improved perivascular AQP-4 protein expression. An immunoblotting analysis revealed that exercise upregulated the PGC-1α/Nrf1/UCP-2 pathway in the 2K1C hypertensive model. However, exercise did not significantly affect Drp-1 expression. Conclusions. Exercise alleviates BBB leakage by restoring structural integrity to the BBB. These improvements may be mediated through the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis.",Med Sci Sports Exerc
40089165,Vascular models of Alzheimer's disease: An overview of recent in vitro models of the blood-brain barrier.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains an overwhelming epidemiologic and economic burden on our healthcare systems, affecting an estimate of 11 % of individuals aged 65 years and older. Increasing evidence of the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in AD pathology lends support to the vascular hypothesis of AD, which posits that damage to cerebral vasculature and impairments to cerebral blood flow are major contributors to neurodegeneration in AD. While the question remains whether the dysfunction of the BBB is the cause or consequence of the disease, understanding of the relationship between vascular pathology and AD is growing increasingly complex, warranting the need for better tools to study vasculature in AD. This review provides an overview of AD models in the context of studying vascular impairments and their relevance in pathology. Specifically, we summarize opportunities in in vitro models, cell sources, and phenotypic observations in sporadic and familial forms of AD. Further, we describe recent advances in generating models which recapitulate in vivo characteristics of the BBB in AD through the use of microfluidics, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and organoid technologies. Finally, we provide a searchable database of reported cell-based models of pathogenic AD gene variants.",Neurobiol Dis
40079562,Magnetic resonance imaging indices for early Alzheimer's disease detection: Brain clearance markers.,"The Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum is characterized by amyloid and tau protein deposition, which is partly attributable to the dysfunction of the brain clearance system. However, the specific phase in the AD continuum wherein aberrant clearance is present remains unclear. This study aimed to assess noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices related to brain clearance functions, such as choroid plexus volume (CPV), lateral ventricular volume (LVV), and the index of diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS index), across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. The CPV, LVV, and ALPS index in amyloid beta (Aβ)-negative healthy controls (HCs) and Aβ-positive HCs as well as in patients with Aβ-negative subjective cognitive decline (SCD), with Aβ-positive SCD, with mild cognitive impairment, and with AD were evaluated. The CPV and LVV were higher, whereas the ALPS index was lower in the patients with more severe disease. The ALPS index was significantly lower in Aβ-positive HCs than in Aβ-negative HCs. In SCD patients and those in the AD continuum, the MRI-based clearance markers were correlated with P-tau and T-tau protein levels and cognitive scores. In summary, brain clearance markers on MRI are associated with tau deposition, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab

Blood-based biomarkers are practical alternatives for the investigation of mechanisms of AD, in addition to accurate disease detection and monitoring.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to examine sex differences across a panel of blood-based plasma biomarkers in participants with and without cognitive impairment due to AD.MethodsPlasma samples were collected from 567 participants from across the AD diagnostic continuum (i.e., normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia) and analyzed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau<sub>181</sub>), and total tau (t-tau). Baseline and longitudinal analyses evaluated for any significant associations between sex and AD-related plasma biomarkers.ResultsFemales were found to have higher plasma GFAP compared to males at baseline regardless of cognitive diagnosis. Among those with AD dementia, females were also found to have higher NfL levels compared to males. Longitudinal analyses found that higher plasma NfL at baseline was associated with an increased risk of worsening AD dementia status only in females. No significant findings were observed for p-tau<sub>181</sub> or t-tau.ConclusionsThis study found significant sex differences in plasma biomarkers of GFAP and NfL. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms mediating these differences.",J Alzheimers Dis
40025835,"Decoding the Nectin Interactome: Implications for Brain Development, Plasticity, and Neurological Disorders.","The nectin family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) comprising nectins and nectin-like molecules has emerged as a key regulator of various pivotal neural processes, including neuronal development, migration, synapse formation, and plasticity. Nectins engage in homophilic and heterophilic interactions to mediate cell-cell adhesion, contributing to the establishment and maintenance of neural circuits. Their extracellular domains facilitate trans-synaptic interactions, while intracellular domains participate in signaling cascades influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic function. The exhibition of distinct localization patterns in neurons, astrocytes, and the blood-brain barrier underscores their diverse roles in the brain. The dysregulation of nectins has been implicated in several neurological disorders, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. This review examines the structural and functional characteristics of nectins and their distribution and molecular mechanisms governing neural connectivity and cognition. It further discusses experimental studies unraveling nectin-mediated pathophysiology and potential therapeutic interventions targeting nectin-related pathways. Collectively, this comprehensive analysis highlights the significance of nectins in brain development, function, and disorders, paving the way for future research directions and clinical implications.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40153090,Protective effects of alpha-lipoic acid on memory deficit induced by repeated doses of solifenacin in mice: the role of nitro-oxidative stress.,"Solifenacin (Sol) is one of the most used antimuscarinics for the treatment of bladder dysfunction and there are no conclusive studies on its effects on learning and memory after long-term use. Since substances with antioxidant action, such as alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), have shown protective action in memory deficit and Alzheimer's disease, we decided to study the effects of Sol alone or associated with ALA in behavioral tests of memory and its relation to nitro-oxidative stress in different brain areas. Mice received saline or Sol p.o. for 14 or 28 days. ALA groups received: (a) saline + ALA, (b) Sol for 14 days and Sol + ALA from the 15th to the 28th days and, (c) Sol + ALA for 28 days. Behavioral tests were performed and oxidative changes (lipid peroxidation) and nitrite in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC) and striatum (ST) were also determined. Sol produced memory alterations in the mice, reducing the step-down latency and the recognition index in the novel object recognition test. Sol also increased lipid peroxidation in PFC, HC and ST and nitrite levels in the HC. On the other hand, ALA associated with Sol was able to restrict the effects caused by Sol alone, both in relation to nitro-oxidative parameters and in relation to behavioral tests. Taken together, our data suggest that ALA can be administered as an adjunctive drug in patients requiring prolonged use of Sol to mitigate these adverse central nervous system effects. However, clinical studies need to be performed to corroborate preclinical research.",Metab Brain Dis

40135492,Krüppel-like factor 4 transcription factor in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells: A potential role in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, with no sufficient cure. Ongoing research is focused on developing new therapies aimed at preventing or delaying the onset of symptoms, slowing disease progression, and improving cognitive and behavioral outcomes in individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. Among the various pathological changes associated with this condition, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage plays a crucial role as it serves as a vital boundary for maintaining central nervous system (CNS) health. Preserving the integrity and functionality of the BBB is essential to protect the brain from amyloid-β accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal degeneration. This review summarizes models of Alzheimer's disease characterized by BBB leakage over time. More importantly, we introduce Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a transcription factor involved in vascular systems, and discuss its relevance to Alzheimer's disease. By elucidating the functions of KLF4 within both vascular and CNSs, this review highlights its potential role in modulating BBB integrity in Alzheimer's pathology, which may contribute to therapeutic strategies for managing this debilitating condition.",Animal Model Exp Med
40124421,Traumatic Brain Injury and Alzheimer's Disease: A Shared Neurovascular Hypothesis.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). TBI and AD share several histopathological hallmarks: namely, beta-amyloid aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and plasma protein infiltration. The relative contributions of these proteinopathies and their interplay in the pathogenesis of both conditions remains unclear although important differences are emerging. This review synthesises emerging evidence for the critical role of the neurovascular unit in mediating protein accumulation and neurotoxicity in both TBI and AD. We propose a shared pathogenic cascade centred on a neurovascular unit, in which increased blood-brain barrier permeability induces a series of noxious mechanisms leading to neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction and ultimately cognitive dysfunction in both conditions. We explore the application of this hypothesis to outstanding research questions and potential treatments for TBI and AD, as well as other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. Limitations of this hypothesis, including the challenges of establishing a causal relationship between neurovascular damage and proteinopathies, are also discussed.",Neurosci Insights
40011801,Combining single-cell ATAC and RNA sequencing for supervised cell annotation.,"MOTIVATION: Single-cell analysis offers insights into cellular heterogeneity and individual cell function. Cell type annotation is the first and critical step for performing such an analysis. Current methods mostly utilize single-cell RNA sequencing data. Several studies demonstrated improved unsupervised annotation when combining RNA with single-cell ATAC sequencing, but improvements in supervised methods have not been explored.
RESULTS: Single-cell 10x genomics multiome datasets containing paired ATAC and RNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neuronal cells with Alzheimer's Disease were used for supervised annotation. Using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods and random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression classification models, we demonstrate the improvement in supervised annotation and prediction confidence in PBMC data when using a combination of RNA seq and ATAC-seq data. No such improvement was observed when annotating neuronal cells. Specifically, F1 scores were improved when using scVI embeddings to annotate PBMC sub-types. CD4 T effector memory cells showed the largest improvement in F1 score.",BMC Bioinformatics
40083008,Sex chromosomes and gonads modify microglial-mediated pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder disproportionally affecting women with sex-specific disease manifestations and therapeutic responses. Microglial-mediated inflammation occurs in response to and perpetuates disease processes, and fundamental sex differences in microglia may contribute to these sex biases. Both sex chromosomes and gonad-derived hormones shape immune responses, but their contribution to immune-mediated mechanisms underlying the sex bias in AD is unclear. Crossing the Four Core Genotype (FCG) model to separate sex chromosome and gonad-derived hormone effects to the 5xFAD model, we found the sex chromosome complement impacted microgliosis, neuroinflammation, plaque burden and neuritic dystrophy. Modification of pathology largely correlated with microgliosis, and sex chromosomes and gonad-derived hormones influenced plaque remodeling and microglial CD11c expression. Our results provide potential trajectories for studying and targeting microglial-mediated sex differences and emphasize the complex interplay between sex chromosomes and hormones during AD.",J Neuroinflammation
40044789,Tau filaments with the Alzheimer fold in human MAPT mutants V337M and R406W.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common forms of early-onset dementia. Unlike AD, FTD begins with behavioral changes before the development of cognitive impairment. Dominantly inherited mutations in MAPT, the microtubule-associated protein tau gene, give rise to cases of FTD and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. These individuals develop abundant filamentous tau inclusions in brain cells in the absence of β-amyloid deposits. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structures of tau filaments from the brains of human MAPT mutants V337M and R406W. Both amino acid substitutions gave rise to tau filaments with the Alzheimer fold, which consisted of paired helical filaments in all V337M and R406W cases and of straight filaments in two V337M cases. We also identified another assembly of the Alzheimer fold into triple tau filaments in a V337M case. Filaments assembled from recombinant tau (297-391) with substitution V337M had the Alzheimer fold and showed an increased rate of assembly.",Nat Struct Mol Biol
40122182,Loss of excitatory inputs and decreased tonic and evoked activity of locus coeruleus neurons in aged P301S mice.,"Tau pathology in the locus coeruleus (LC) is associated with several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Phosphorylated tau accumulates in the LC and results in inflammation, synaptic loss, and eventually cell death as the disease progresses. Loss of LC neurons and noradrenergic innervation is thought to contribute to the symptoms of cognitive decline later in disease. While loss and degeneration of LC neurons has been well studied, less is known about changes in LC physiology at advanced stages of tau pathology that precedes neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo electrophysiological properties of LC neurons in male and female mice from the P301S mouse model of tauopathy at 9 months of age, a time-point when significant tau accumulation, cell death, and cognitive impairments are observed. We found a reduction in excitatory inputs and changes in excitatory post-synaptic current kinetics in male and female P301S. There was also a decrease in spontaneous discharge of LC neurons and an increase in AP threshold in P301S mice of both sexes. Finally, we observed a decrease in excitability and increase in rheobase current in P301S mice. Despite the decrease in LC activity in ex vivo slices, we did not identify differences in total tissue norepinephrine (NE) or NE metabolites in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. Together these findings demonstrate reductions in the activity and excitability of LC neurons at late stages of tau accumulation. However, compensatory mechanisms may maintain normal NE levels in LC projection regions in vivo.",Neurobiol Dis

Alleviate oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease in vitro and in vivo models by regulating Mst1 and affecting the Nrf2/Sirt3 pathway.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and oxidative stress plays a significant role in its progression. Owing to its nourishing effects, Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & maxim.) maxim. (ES) has gained widespread popularity globally as a functional food and long-term consumption has been shown to enhance memory. The phenylpropanoid components extracted from Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & maxim.) maxim. (ESP) exhibit a diverse array of bioactivities and are commonly employed in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms by which ESP alleviates oxidative stress in AD models require further investigation. Therefore, this study utilized SAMP8 mice as models for AD and employed L-glutamate (L-Glu)-induced HT22 cells to establish an in vitro AD model. The effects of ESP on cognitive function were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Additionally, various techniques such as pathology, immunofluorescence staining (IF), ROS staining, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), Mst1 inhibitor analysis, and western blotting (WB) were conducted to further investigate the pharmacological efficacy and potential molecular mechanisms of ESP. In vivo, ESP was found to improve cognitive function in SAMP8 mice and alleviate AD-like pathological features. In vitro, ESP reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, CETSA analysis confirmed the binding affinity between ESP and Mst1, demonstrated that ESP modulated the Mst1 signaling pathway to mitigate oxidative stress and decrease ROS levels. These findings suggested that ESP holded significant potential for developing therapeutic strategies for AD.",Bioorg Chem
40093585,A Single-Nucleus Transcriptomic Atlas Reveals Cellular and Genetic Characteristics of Alzheimer's-Like Pathology in Aging Tree Shrews.,"The lack of natural aging-inducing Alzheimer's disease (AD) model presents a significant gap in the current preclinical research. Here, we identified a unique cohort of 10 naturally aging tree shrews (TSs) displaying distinct Alzheimer's-like pathology (ALP) from a population of 324, thereby establishing a novel model that closely mirrors human AD progression. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we generated a comprehensive transcriptome atlas, revealing the cellular diversity and gene expression changes underlying AD pathology in aged TSs. Particularly, distinct differentiation trajectories of neural progenitor cells were highly associated with AD pathology. Intriguingly, cross-species comparisons among humans, TSs, monkeys, and mice highlighted a greater cellular homogeneity of TSs to primates and humans than to mice. Our extended cross-species analysis by including a direct comparison between human and TS hippocampal tissue under AD conditions uncovered conserved cell types, enriched synaptic biological processes, and elevated excitatory/inhibitory imbalance across species. Cell-cell communication analysis unveiled parallel patterns between AD human and ALP TSs, with both showing reduced interaction strength and quantity across most cell types. Overall, our study provides rich, high-resolution resources on the cellular and molecular landscape of the ALP TS hippocampus, reinforcing the utility of TSs as a robust model for AD research.",MedComm (2020)
40078868,Could immunotherapy and regulatory T cells be used therapeutically to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments are a growing problem in the healthcare world with the ageing population. There are currently no effective treatments available; however, it has been suggested that targeting neuroinflammation may be a successful approach in slowing the progression of neurodegeneration. Reducing the destructive hyperinflammatory pathology to maintain homeostasis in neural tissue is a promising option to consider. This review explores the mechanisms behind neuroinflammation and the effectiveness of immunotherapy in slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The key components of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease researched are microglia, astrocytes, cytokines and CD8+ effector T cells. The role of oxidative stress on modulating regulatory T cells and some of the limitations of regulatory T cell-based therapies are also explored. Increasing regulatory T cells can decrease activation of microglia, proinflammatory cytokines and astrocytes; however, it can also increase levels of inflammatory cytokines. There is a complex network of regulatory T cell interactions that reduce Alzheimer's disease pathology, which is not fully understood. Exploring the current literature, further research into the use of immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease is vital to determine the potential of these techniques; however, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that increasing regulatory T cells count does prevent Alzheimer's disease symptoms and pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Some exciting innovative therapies are muted to explore in the future. The function of regulatory T cells in the presence of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress should be investigated further in patients with neurogenerative disorders to ascertain if combination therapies could reduce oxidative stress while also enhancing regulatory T cells function. Could methods of immunotherapy infuse exogenous functional Tregs or enhance the immune environment in favour of endogenous regulatory T cells differentiation, thus reducing neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative pathology, inhibiting the progression of Alzheimer's disease?",Brain Commun

We explored the utility of BMAA and glyphosate's metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) for serving as potential markers of NDDs by comparing levels of wastewater-borne BMAA and AMPA with regional U.S. rates of NDD prevalence. Newly developed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were applied to U.S. wastewater samples (n = 87) and resultant concentrations of putative biomarkers were statistically compared to NDD prevalence rates in conjunction with environmental data on algal blooms and agricultural glyphosate use. Locations of algal blooms were found to be significantly associated (p = 0.01) with ALS prevalence rates per 100,000 people. BMAA levels in wastewater were highly correlated (p < 0.0001) with ALS prevalence rates by region. BMAA in wastewater typically peaked in summer months. We conclude that NDD biomarker detection in wastewater holds potential value, with BMAA outperforming AMPA. Furthermore, prevalence data for NDDs may have to be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at a higher geospatial resolution to further enhance the value for the present type of analysis. Further method development is needed for AMPA to be quantified using LC-MS/MS. Future method developments focusing on metabolites (e.g., AMPA) may enable epidemiologists to determine human exposure levels rather than the mere occurrence of toxic organic chemicals in the environment.",Sci Total Environ
40055657,Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011-2014.,"BACKGROUND: The red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is a novel comprehensive biomarker of inflammation and nutrition, which has emerged as a reliable prognostic indicator for adverse outcomes and mortality in patients with various diseases. However, the association between RAR and low cognitive performance in older adults remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the relationship between RAR and low cognitive performance among older adults in the United States.
METHODS: This study, a retrospective analysis, included 2,765 participants aged 60 years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2011 and 2014. Low cognitive performance was assessed using word learning subset from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). Low cognitive performance was defined as scores below the lowest quartile in each cognitive test. The association between RAR and low cognitive performance was evaluated using weighted multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: After adjusting for all potential confounders, RAR was independently and linearly positively associated with both low DSST performance and low AFT performance. Specifically, compared to participants in the first quartile of RAR, those in the fourth quartile had adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 1.81 (1.03, 3.20) for low DSST performance and 1.68 (1.05, 2.67) for low AFT performance. Subgroup analysis did not reveal significant interactions between stratification variables.
CONCLUSION: RAR is significantly linearly positively associated with low cognitive performance. Maintaining a lower RAR may be a crucial strategy for mitigating the risk of cognitive decline in the elderly population.",BMC Geriatr
40012738,"The effects of amyloidosis and aging on glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, and interneurons in the barrel cortex and non-neocortical brain regions.","Previous studies on changes in the distribution of GABAergic interneurons and excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging were mainly conducted in the neocortex and hippocampus. However, the limbic system is the primary and crucial location for AD progression. Therefore, in this study, we utilized AD and aging mouse models to investigate the E/I balance and the distribution of parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-expressing cells in S1BF (barrel field of primary somatosensory cortex, barrel cortex), CA1 hippocampal area and brain regions beyond the neocortex and hippocampus, including retrosplenial cortex (RSC, which is composed of RSG and RSA), piriform cortex (Pir), amygdala (BMA), and hypothalamus (DM). We discovered that amyloidosis may disrupt the alignment of excitatory pre- and postsynaptic quantities. Amyloidosis reduces the quantity of synapses and SST cells, but does not impact the counts of PV cells. By contrast, aging is linked to a decline in synapses, I/E ratios, SST and PV cells. Amyloidosis affects the S1BF and BMA, while aging may harm all studied regions, including the S1BF, RSC, hippocampus, Pir, BMA, and DM. Aging mostly affects synapses and I/E ratios in Pir, BMA, and DM, and PV and SST interneurons in the hippocampus.",Front Neuroanat

Emerging evidence implicates necroptosis in AD pathogenesis, driven by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL pathway, which promotes neuronal damage, inflammation, and disease progression. Exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, can modulate key inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, HMGB1, and IL-1β, thereby inhibiting necroptotic signaling. Additionally, exercise enhances O-GlcNAc glycosylation, preventing Tau hyperphosphorylation and stabilizing neuronal integrity.

40039434,"Balancing Spectral, Temporal and Spatial Information for EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification.","The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.Clinical relevance- This study proposes balancing the spectral, temporal and spatial feature resolution to improve EEGbased diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40077497,Comparative Analysis of Egg Yolk Phospholipid Unsaturation and Its Impact on Neural Health in Alzheimer Disease Mice.,"The mechanism of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC) in alleviating Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not yet been clear. The fatty acid composition of PC, especially the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), may be a critical determinant of their structural and functional roles. This study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of the unsaturation levels of egg yolk PC and their impact on neurological health in a murine model of AD. The results showed that oral administration of high and low unsaturation PC (HUP, LUP) enhanced learning and memory abilities in AD mice, with the HUP intervention demonstrating superior efficacy compared to the LUP. Follow-up biochemical analysis of the brain tissue also suggested that HUP intervention effectively mitigated oxidative-stress damage and inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation in AD mice. Meanwhile, lipidomic analyses of the mouse hippocampus revealed that HUP intervention substantially increased the levels of phospholipids, such as PEt (phosphatidylethanol) and BisMePA (bis(methylthio)phenylacetic acid), which are recognized as vital components of neuronal cell membranes. Furthermore, HUP intervention markedly elevated the levels of phospholipids incorporating PUFAs in the hippocampus.

The etiology and progression of these disorders are influenced by a complex interplay of environmental factors and genetic predispositions with specific genetic markers, such as mutations in the APOE and HTT genes, which play pivotal roles. Current therapeutic interventions predominantly focus on symptom management; however, emerging strategies, including gene therapies, anti-amyloid agents, and neuroprotective approaches, are designed to directly target the underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in biomarker discovery and imaging methodologies have emerged as essential tools for early diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy in these disorders. In the context of AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau levels, along with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, are well-established biomarkers. Similarly, CSF alpha-synuclein and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging have been employed as diagnostic tools for PD. Moreover, emerging biomarkers, such as blood-based tau and the Aβ42/40 ratio for AD, as well as the neurofilament light chain (NfL) for ALS and PD, hold promise for enhancing early diagnostic accuracy and facilitating the longitudinal assessment of disease progression. This study comprehensively examined the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on amyloid-beta plaque deposition and tau protein aggregation in AD, alpha-synuclein misfolding in PD, and aberrant protein aggregation in ALS and HD, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological basis of these disorders.",Mol Biol Rep
40082178,Lifestyle factors and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease: A narrative review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by amyloid-β (Aβ), tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Blood-based biomarkers are emerging as a minimally invasive tool for disease detection and monitoring. This review depicts the relationships between modifiable lifestyle factors (nutrition, physical activity (PA), sleep, alcohol consumption, smoking, and social isolation) and plasma biomarkers of AD: Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42/40,</sub> phosphorylated tau, total tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Limited evidence suggests that better nutrition is associated with favourable AD plasma biomarker profiles and that PA is associated with less plasma NfL and Aβ, whilst poor sleep is associated with elevated plasma Aβ. However, lack of data and inconsistent findings highlight the need for further investigation to substantiate or refute these trends. Moreover, future research should include the analysis of lifestyle on plasma biomarkers according to gender, metabolic health and APOE status. Considering the growing emphasis on modifiable lifestyle factors for preventing and delaying dementia onset further investigation is justified.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40039162,The Development of an Alzheimer's Diagnostic Sensor and Algorithm using Microsaccades Biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible neuro degenerative disease, and associated declines in cognitive function have a significant effect on daily life. Methods such as mini-mental state examination and Montreal cognitive assessment, the existing diagnostic methods for Alzheimer's disease, take a long time and have poor objective assessment score accuracy. This paper presents a novel method that assesses the brain's cognitive state by utilizing eye-tracking technology. The experiment results confirmed that the number of microsaccade occurrences on the x and y axes gradually increased as aging progressed. In addition, it was confirmed that the number of microsaccade occurrences increased as cognitive function scores declined, even among seniors in the same age groups. Based on these results, we prove the correlation between aging and the brain's cognitive functions and verifies that declines in the brain's cognitive functions affect microsaccades.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40011292,FDA-Approved Secukinumab Alleviates Glial Activation and Immune Cell Infiltration in MPTP-Induced Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effect of the FDA-approved Secukinumab (SEC), an IL-17A inhibitor, on PD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of SEC and its potential mechanisms in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Male C57BL/6 J mice were mainly assigned to three groups: Sham, MPTP, and MPTP + SEC. Motor coordination was assessed using the climbing rod and rotarod tests. Dopaminergic neurons (TH +) and glial cells (Iba-1 + , GFAP +) in the substantia nigra were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Flow cytometry was used to analyze immune cell populations in the brain and spleen. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were quantified using RT-PCR. SEC treatment significantly alleviated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and improved motor coordination in MPTP mice. It also reduced the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, including CD4 + T cells, NK cells, and monocyte-macrophages into the brain. SEC attenuated glial activation (Iba-1 + , GFAP +) and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9), which recruit immune cells into the brain. These results suggest that Secukinumab protects dopaminergic neurons and attenuates neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced model. SEC treatment in PD might be an effective therapeutic approach for clinical application in the future. HIGHLIGHTS: • Secukinumab reduces the loss of dopaminergic neurons and axons in MPTP mice. • Secukinumab inhibits the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain in MPTP mice. • Secukinumab inhibits the activation of glial cells and reduces neuroinflammation in MPTP mice.",Inflammation
40153031,Sex-specific modulation of FOLR1 and its cycle enzyme genes in Alzheimer's disease brain regions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive and functional decline. Its incidence increases significantly with age and is more prevalent in women than men. We investigated the folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) gene expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of AD and non-demented healthy control (NDHC) subjects. Our cohort included 3,946 samples: 2,391 NDHC and 1,555 AD patients, stratified by brain region, age, and sex. Interestingly, a significant increase in FOLR1 expression was observed only in females with AD compared to NDHC females. Furthermore, we found that FOLR1 expression was differentially increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and diencephalon (DIE) only in AD females. Moreover, in females, genes involved in the folic acid (FA) cycle that drives DNA synthesis were significantly modulated. In contrast, in males, downregulation of TYMS effectively blocks the completion of the cycle, thereby preventing downstream DNA synthesis. Tissue Transcriptome Deconvolution (TTD) analysis revealed astrocytes and endothelial cells associated with FOLR1 expression in both AD males and females. Gene Ontology analysis supported these findings, showing enrichment in processes aligned with these cell types. Positive correlations between brain FOLR1 expression and markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and endothelial cells (CD31) provided further validation. Our findings suggest a potential role for sex-dependent FOLR1 expression and its association with specific brain regions and cellular processes in AD.",Metab Brain Dis
40156934,Sex-specific decline in prefrontal cortex mitochondrial bioenergetics in aging baboons correlates with walking speed.,"Mitochondria play a crucial role in brain homeostasis and changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics are linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We investigated changes in the activities of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in normally aging baboon brains and determined how these changes relate to donor sex, morning cortisol levels, and walking speed. We assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics from archived prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissues from a large cohort (60 individuals) of well-characterized aging baboons (6.6-22.8 years, approximately equivalent to 26.4-91.2 human years). Aging was associated with a decline in mitochondrial ETC complexes in the PFC, which was more pronounced when normalized for citrate synthase activity, suggesting that the decline is predominantly driven by changes in the specific activity of individual complexes rather than global changes in mitochondrial content. When donor sex was used as a covariate, we found that ETC activity was preserved with age in females and declined in males. Males had higher activities of each individual ETC complex and greater lactate dehydrogenase activity at a given age relative to females. Circulating cortisol negatively correlated with walking speed when male and female data were combined. We also observed a robust positive predictive relationship between walking speed and respiration linked to complexes I, III, and IV in males but not in females. This data reveals a link between frailty and PFC bioenergetic function and highlights a potential molecular mechanism for sexual dimorphism in brain resilience.",Neurobiol Aging
40009150,Structural insights of AKT and its activation mechanism for drug development.,"AKT1, a serine/threonine kinase, is pivotal in signaling and regulating cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. This review focuses on the structural insights and the essential features required for its active conformation. AKT belongs to the AGC kinase group and has three isoforms: AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3. AKT has three functional regions: PH domain, kinase domain, and hydrophobic motif. AKT1 activation involves intricate conformational changes, including transitions in the αC-in, DFG-in, G-loop, activation loop, and PH domain out, S-spine and R-spine formation, as well as phosphorylation at Thr 308 and Ser 473, which enable AKT1 to adopt active conformation. The analysis highlights the limitations of the AlphaFold-predicted AKT1 structure, which lacks key elements of the active state, including ATP, magnesium ion coordination, phosphatidylinositol-(1,3,4,5)-tetraphosphate, substrate peptide, and phosphorylation at Thr 308 and Ser 473. This study underscores the necessity of these features for stabilizing the kinase domain and facilitating efficient substrate phosphorylation. By consolidating structural insights and activation mechanisms, this review aims to inform the development of computational models and targeted therapeutics for AKT1 activators in diseases such as hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, cerebral ischemia, acute hepatic failure, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and alzheimer's disease.",Mol Divers
40034514,Sleep disturbances and their correlation with memory impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Episodic memory impairment is the core clinical feature of patients with typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an early stage. Since sleep plays a very important role in memory consolidation, the relationship between memory impairment and sleep disorders in AD patients is worthy of investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate sleep disturbances and their correlations with memory impairment in patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
METHODS: Forty-three patients with AD, 43 patients with aMCI, and 43 cognitively unimpaired controls (CUCs) were recruited and subjected to memory assessment via the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised and objective sleep evaluation via polysomnography (PSG).
RESULTS: The total sleep time and the percentages of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage 3 (N3) and the rapid eye movement (REM) were lower, while the percentages of NREM sleep stage 2 (N2) were greater in the AD and aMCI groups than in the CUC group (all p < 0.01). Compared with the CUC group, the AD group also presented a longer sleep latency and higher NREM sleep stage 1 (N1) percentage, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), periodic limb movements during sleep index (PLMSI), and arousal index (AI). Both total learning scores and delayed recall scores were positively correlated with the N3 sleep percentage and negatively correlated with the AHI and PLMSI (all p < 0.01). Recognition scores were positively correlated with the N3 sleep percentage and negatively correlated with the AI (all p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sleep disturbance is correlated with learning and memory disability in AD and aMCI patients. PSG is useful for screening and monitoring AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
39994990,Institutionalization of persons with Alzheimer's disease in the Czech and Slovak Republics.,"BackgroundThe prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing, and with it comes the demand for specialized services. Current information on the institutionalization of patients with AD is limited.ObjectiveTo determine the level of institutionalization among AD patients in the facilities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.MethodsA survey of the rate of institutionalization in facilities in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. The survey collects data on the institutionalization of patients suffering from AD in relation to the capacity of the facilities and the prevalence of the disease. Data were collected by representative quantitative survey, during years 2019-2021.ResultsPatients with AD occupy approximately 25% of the total capacities of institutions in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The rate of institutionalization of patients with AD is estimated at 20.5% in the Czech Republic and 24% in the Slovak Republic. This is more than the estimated worldwide rate of institutionalization of people with AD (16%) but less than the estimated rate of institutionalization of these patients in high-income countries (31%).ConclusionsAs the prevalence of AD increases, so do the demands for care. If there is no increase in institutional capacity, this growth will put more pressure on home care. In order to provide specialized care to as many patients as possible, emphasis must be placed on increasing the capacity of institutions.",J Alzheimers Dis
40089002,Effects of resistance exercise on behavioral and molecular changes in transgenic female mice for Alzheimer's disease in early and advanced stages.,"UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects memory and cognition, with a higher prevalence in women. Given the lack of effective treatment, physical activity stands out as a complementary approach to prevent or delay disease progression. While numerous studies on humans and animals indicate that aerobic exercise induces brain changes, the impact of resistance exercise (RE) on AD is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the behavioral and molecular changes induced by RE in female transgenic mice with AD at the early and advanced stages of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult (initial phase - 7 to 8 months of age, n = 32) and adult/elderly (advanced phase - 22 to 23 months of age, n = 32) female mice (2xTg-AD) for the APPSWE/PS1dE9 mutation were subjected to a four-week RE protocol. Mobility, anxiety-like behavior, long-term memory (LTM), and depressive-like behavior were assessed. Beta-amyloid (βA) and cytokines were quantified using the ELISA technique.
RESULTS: There was a progressive increase in strength in both trained groups at different ages. RE reversed memory deficits only in adult AD animals and the anxiety-like behavior only in adult/elderly AD animals. RE reversed depressive-like behavior in adult and adult/elderly AD animals. RE reduced βA only in adult AD animals. RE modified the expression of several cytokines in animals in the early and advanced stage of AD.
CONCLUSION: RE can be a promising strategy to minimize the deleterious effects of AD; however, its effectiveness may be more limited to the early stages of the disease.",Exp Neurol
40015758,"Hearing loss, diet, and cognitive decline: interconnections for dementia prevention.","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss poses a significant global public health concern associated with cognitive decline. Among the many risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD), hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory impairment in older adults and has emerged as a significant, yet often overlooked, modifiable risk factor for dementia.
OBJECTIVES: To access 1) the association between diet and risk of hearing loss in older adults and 2) the modifying effect of diet on the impact of hearing loss on cognitive decline in an aging population.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: The Chicago Health and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,145 older adults (62 % non-Hispanic Black, 63 % female).
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported hearing ability was assessed during each cycle of data collection. Diet was assessed by a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Diet quality was evaluated using a 144-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, focusing on adherence to dietary patterns such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean, and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND). Cognitive function assessment was conducted during the in-home visits at each cycle. Four cognitive tests, including the East Boston tests of immediate and delayed recall, the mini-mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities test, were included. We used linear mixed effect models to examine 1) the association of hearing loss and cognitive decline and 2) the association of diet on cognitive decline through modifying risk hearing loss. Discrete-time survival analysis examined the association between dietary patterns and the time to hearing impairment.
RESULTS: Among 5,145 participants included in the analyses, 747 (14.5 %) reported hearing loss, including 207 Black adults and 199 White adults. Each unit increase in the DASH, MedDiet, and MIND scores was associated with 19 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 0.94, P < 0.001), 11 % (95 % CI: 0.79, 1.00, P = 0.05), and 13 % (95 % CI: 0.87, 0.99, P < 0.05) lower risk for hearing loss, respectively. High adherence to the Western diet was associated with an earlier onset of hearing loss up to 14 months (P < 0.05). Participants had an increased rate of cognitive decline after reporting hearing loss. During follow-up, participants in the highest tertile of the DASH diet score who reported hearing loss experienced a 17 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.07 ± 0.01) compared to those without hearing loss (β = -0.06 ± 0.003). However, this decline was significantly slower than that of participants observed in the lowest tertile of the DASH diet, who exhibited a 67 % faster cognitive decline (β = -0.10 ± 0.012, P = 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Healthy dietary patterns, particularly the DASH diet, was associated with a reduced risk of hearing loss and slower cognitive decline following hearing loss. Clinically, these findings underscore the importance of dietary quality in preserving cognitive health by potentially mitigating risk of hearing loss or delaying the onset of hearing loss in older adults.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
39983826,The lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2-macroautophagy pathway is involved in the regulatory effects of hippocampal aromatase on Aβ accumulation and AD-like behavior.,"AIMS: Hippocampal aromatase (AROM) knockdown induces Aβ accumulation and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like spatial learning and memory impairment, and early hippocampal AROM overexpression in APP/PS1 mice prevents Aβ deposition and memory loss later in life. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism and provide novel prevention and treatment targets for AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: AROM-inhibiting viral vectors were constructed and injected into the hippocampi of adult female mice, after which label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were conducted. Additional viral vectors targeting LAMP2 or LC3 were constructed and used to treat HT22 cells. LAMP2 expression was verified, and macroautophagy levels, autophagosome formation and Aβ accumulation were examined. Additionally, ovariectomy combined with the hippocampal injection of LAMP2 inhibition/overexpression viral vectors was applied, and learning and memory abilities and Aβ accumulation were examined.
KEY FINDINGS: Proteomics revealed the enrichment of CMA and autophagy, and LAMP2 was the most significantly upregulated protein. Higher LAMP2 levels were correlated with lower macroautophagy and autophagosomes levels but were correlated with higher Aβ accumulation, and vice versa. Additionally, hippocampal LAMP2 mediated the effects of ovariectomy on spatial memory and Aβ accumulation.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrated the important role of the hippocampal LAMP2-macroautophagy pathway in mediating both hippocampal and ovarian estrogen regulation of Aβ accumulation and AD-like behavior, indicating that LAMP2 might be a novel target for both hippocampal and circulating estrogen deficiency-associated memory impairments, such as AD.",Life Sci
40076721,Cellular Prion Protein and Amyloid-β Oligomers in Alzheimer's Disease-Are There Connections?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Pathological deposits of neurotoxin proteins within the brain, such as amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, are prominent features in AD. The prion protein (PrP) is involved in neurodegeneration via its conversion from the normal cellular form (PrPC) to the infection prion protein scrapie (PrPSc) form. Some studies indicated that post-translationally modified PrPC isoforms play a fundamental role in AD pathological progression. Several studies have shown that the interaction of Aβ oligomers (Aβos) with the N-terminal residues of the PrPC protein region appears critical for neuronal toxicity. PrPC-Aβ binding always occurs in AD brains and is never detected in non-demented controls, and the binding of Aβ aggregates to PrPC is restricted to the N-terminus of PrPC. In this study, we aimed to gather all of the recent information about the connections between PrPC and AD, with potential clinical implications.",Int J Mol Sci
39988573,Examining multimorbidity contributors to dementia over time.,"INTRODUCTION: Multimorbidity is associated with increased risk of dementia, but previous estimation of the joint contribution of constituent conditions to dementia incidence did not model additive contributions or temporal proximity in the sequential onset of conditions.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from 9944 Health and Retirement Study participants and Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, ages 68-99, without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) at baseline, from 1998-2016. ADRD and chronic condition were encoded using validated claims algorithms. We estimated the absolute contribution of eight conditions to ADRD with the longitudinal extension of the average attributable fraction (LE-AAF).
RESULTS: Hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and arthritis additively accounted for 71.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.9%-79.1%) of ADRD incident cases based on LE-AAF.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that multimorbidity plays a pivotal role in ADRD incidence. Targeting constituents of a cardiovascular path to dementia may contribute most to lowering dementia risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Most dementia cases (71.8%) were attributable to eight chronic conditions. Hypertension was the largest contributor to dementia risk. Confidence intervals were smallest for constituents of a cardiovascular path to dementia. Longitudinal extension of the average attributable fractions (LE-AAFs) explicitly consider longitudinal patterns of comorbidities. Acute myocardial infarction did not contribute significantly to dementia incidence.",Alzheimers Dement
40108882,Exploring novel therapeutic strategies: Could psychedelic perspectives offer promising solutions for Alzheimer's disease comorbidities?,"The increasing prevalence of dementia within an ageing global population, combined with prolonged life expectancy, accentuates Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a multifaceted healthcare challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the limited therapeutic options currently available. Addressing the intricacies of AD management, the mitigation of comorbidities has emerged as a pivotal facet of treatment. Comorbid conditions, such as neurobehavioral symptoms, play a role in shaping the clinical course, management, and outcomes of this pathology; highlighting the importance of comprehensive care approaches for affected individuals. Exploration of psychedelic compounds in psychiatric and palliative care settings has recently uncovered promising therapeutic potential, enhancing neuroplasticity, emotional processing and connection. These effects are particularly relevant in the context of AD, where psychedelic therapy offers hope not only for mitigating core symptoms but also for addressing the array of comorbidities associated with this condition. The integration of this comprehensive method offers a chance to significantly enhance the care provided to those navigating the intricate landscape of AD. Therefore, the current paper reviews the intricate link between more frequent additional health conditions that may coexist with dementia, particularly in the context of AD, and explores the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds in addressing these concurrent conditions.",Dialogues Clin Neurosci

Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids correlated with AD severity in humans. Notably, mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.",Nat Aging
40034364,"Association between dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and liver cancer: A Mendelian randomization analysis.","BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated an inverse association between neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, the relationship between liver cancer and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between dementia, specifically AD, and liver cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a bidirectional, two-sample MR analysis using publicly available genome-wide association studies data. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed as the primary analytical approach. To detect and correct for the effects of horizontal pleiotropy, we applied three complementary methods: MR Egger, weighted median, and Maximum likelihood.
RESULTS: The analysis indicated significant associations between dementia and a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (OR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.81-0.95; p < 0.001) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.72-0.92; p < 0.001). AD was significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCC (OR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.88-0.99; p = 0.033), ICC (OR: 0.85; 95%CI: 0.78-0.93; p < 0.001), and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.43-0.93; p = 0.020). Conversely, inverse MR analyses indicated that ICC was associated with increased dementia risk (OR: 1.05; 95%CI: 1.01-1.09; p = 0.019) and CHC with increased AD risk (OR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.00-1.04; p = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that dementia, particularly AD, is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. Conversely, liver cancer may be associated with a slightly increased risk of developing dementia and AD, although some observational studies have reported a lower risk of these conditions among cancer survivors.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

40057456,Comparing high and low amyloid producers in Alzheimer's disease: An in-depth analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio has proven to be a more reliable biomarker for amyloid pathology than CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> in Alzheimer's disease (AD), helping to correctly classify patients with positive tau biomarkers (T+) that would otherwise have remained outside of the AD continuum. It was shown that the Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio better captures a relative decrease of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in patients with high CSF Aβ. However, whether patients with high-amyloid (HiA) AD, in whom A+ is defined by the Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio, exactly compare with their low-amyloid (LoA) counterparts, in whom A+ is defined by Aβ<sub>42</sub> solely, deserves further analysis.
METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with A+T+ AD and evidence of cognitive and neurodegenerative changes (N+). LoA patients were operationally defined as patients with T+N+ and low CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>, while HiA patients were defined as patients with T+N+ and normal CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> but abnormal Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio. Tau CSF biomarkers, neuropsychological profile, rates of cognitive decline, structural and metabolic imaging, ApoE genotype and brain neuropathology were compared between the HiA and LoA groups.
RESULTS: At the time of the lumbar puncture, LoA patients were significantly younger than the HiA patients (68.9±8.7years vs. 71.8±9.4; P=0.0015) and had a lower Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (18.7±6.4 vs. 20.7±6.2; P=0.0005). There was no difference in the neuropsychological profile nor in the annual rates of cognitive decline between the two groups with early AD. No differences were retrieved between groups on CSF Tau and P-Tau biomarkers, atrophy and brain metabolism, distribution of the APOE4 allele and APOE4/E4 genotype, and neuropathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study supports the surrogate use of the Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio as an equivalent to Aβ<sub>42</sub> to define AD. We showed that HiA CSF profiles were not associated with differences in cognition, brain structures and metabolism, APOE genotype tau CSF biomarkers or the rates of cognitive decline, but may be the associated with later-onset and early-stage AD.",Rev Neurol (Paris)
39987791,"Brain activation in older adults during odor identification is related to ApoE, t-tau/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, and hippocampal volume.","Despite altered odor identification preceding and predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline, an inadequate understanding of how AD pathology affects odor memory functions limits its use as a preclinical biomarker. Multivariate linear regression was applied to whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activations during odor identification task (OID) responses in older adults without dementia (N = 36, 44.4 % ε4 carriers, M<sub>Age</sub>= 76.61). Apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele status, cerebrospinal fluid levels of total-tau to Amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub>, and MRI-derived hippocampal volume measures were used as predictors. The predictors described significant BOLD variation in regions that are associated with necessary OID functions and affected by AD neurodegeneration during OID responses; moreover, all predictors were associated with significant (P &lt; .001) negative BOLD effects in essential task regions during at least one response condition. This evidence suggests significant pathological effects of AD biomarkers on OID-response neural activity in older adults without dementia and should motivate future combined-biomarker investigations of OID functions in preclinical populations.",Neurobiol Aging
39988604,Neuroprotective mitochondria targeted small molecule restores synapses and the distribution of synaptic mitochondria in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.,"Loss of synaptic activity correlates best with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that mild inhibition of mitochondrial complex I with the small molecule tricyclic pyrone compound CP2 restores long-term potentiation and cognitive function assessed by electrophysiology and behavior tests in multiple mouse models of AD. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction, we examined the effect of CP2 treatment on synapses, and the distribution and morphology of synaptic mitochondria in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Structural data confirmed the loss of synapses in APP/PS1 compared to non-transgenic (NTG) littermates. Mitochondrial distribution assessed in pre- and postsynaptic compartments was significantly altered in AD model demonstrating increased presence of mitochondria around dendritic spines compared to NTG mice, indicating the loss of mitochondrial ability to support synaptic function. CP2 treatment restored distribution of synaptic mitochondria and the number of synapses to the NTG control levels. Improved synaptic function in CP2-treated APP/PS1 mice was supported by RNA-seq analysis indicating upregulation of genes involved in axonal guidance, dendritic maturation and synaptic function, and Western blot analysis of brain tissue. Taken together, functional, imaging, biochemistry and structural findings further support the potential of targeting mitochondria as a therapeutic approach for AD.",Sci Rep

Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is applied to extract features that reveal complex functional connectivity patterns in the brain. These features are then used as inputs for an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model to classify AD stages. The model's performance is assessed through comprehensive evaluation metrics to ensure robustness and reliability. Applying this framework on datasets which contain meticulously validated fMRI scans such as the OASIS and AD Neuroimaging Initiative datasets, we validate the merit of this proposed work. The framework's results show improvement in the collective performance of two-class and multi-class classification. Feeding ELM with MVPA features yield decent outcomes given a generalizable and computationally-efficient model. This study underscores the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately distinguishing AD stages, offering potential improvements in AD and AD stages detection.",Front Med (Lausanne)
40031185,HSGO: Harmonized Swarm Learning With Guided Optimization for Multi-Center sMRI Classification of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Developing robust Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification models necessitates extensive training data, but aggregating multi-center medical data poses privacy risks. Although Federated Learning (FL) and Swarm Learning (SL) allow training generic models without data sharing, their performance is limited by variations in AD pathology features and sample class imbalances across centers. To address this issue, we propose a novel Harmonized Swarm Learning framework with Guided Optimization (HSGO) to enhance multi-center collaboration while preserving data privacy. Our framework employs a class-balanced loss function to train a robust generic model and guides the optimization of personalized models towards the generic model, eliminating extra AD pathology feature extraction steps. Furthermore, we design a dynamic feature similarity storage mechanism to facilitate personalized training. Experiments performed under two different multi-center data partitioning scenarios demonstrate that HSGO achieves competitive performance when compared with five baseline methods. Additionally, Layer- wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) analysis indicates that HSGO may help identify potential key brain regions in AD by integrating local and global features compared to traditional SL.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40166019,"Rapamycin enhances neurovascular, peripheral metabolic, and immune function in cognitively normal, middle-aged APOE4 Carriers: genotype-dependent effects compared to non-carriers.","Rapamycin, known for its anti-aging properties, shows promise as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in APOE4 carriers-the highest-risk group for late-onset AD. Here we show that a 4-week open-label trial of low-dose Rapamycin (Sirolimus; 1 mg/day) significantly improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) relative to baseline in cognitively normal APOE4 carriers (E4(+)) aged 45-65. It also reduced inflammatory cytokines, enhanced lipid metabolism, increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and enriched gut microbiome composition linked to SCFA production. Conversely, non-carriers (E4(-)) displayed stable baseline-to-post-treatment CBF and SCFA and demonstrated different treatment-related patterns of metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects than E4(+). Serum amyloid A and tau remained unchanged for both groups. These findings suggest Rapamycin may counter early vascular and metabolic deficits in E4(+) individuals, with genotype-specific effects. By bridging anti-aging research and AD prevention, this study highlights a novel, safe, and precision-based approach to mitigating AD risk in APOE4 carriers.",Res Sq
40118459,Visualize neuronal membrane cholesterol with split- fluorescent protein tagged YDQA sensor.,"Cholesterol is a major component of the cellular plasma membrane (PM), and its homeostasis is essential for brain health. Dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in vivo visualization of cholesterol has remained challenging, hindering a comprehensive understanding of AD pathology. In this study, we generated a new sensor combining the split-fluorescent protein tags with YDQA, a derivate of cholesterol-dependent cytolysin PFO. Through a series of validations in cell and C. elegans models, we demonstrate that the new sensor (name as sfPMcho) efficiently detects neuronal PM cholesterol. We further applied this sensor in 5X FAD and APOE KO mice models and revealed the cholesterol changes within neurons. PM cholesterol became sparse and locally aggregated in neuron bodies but significantly accumulated in nerve fibers. Collectively, this study provides a new tool for detecting neuronal PM cholesterol in vivo and uncovers cholesterol abnormalities in AD-related pathology at the cellular level. Further development based on this sensor or the similar strategy are to be expected.",J Lipid Res
40017822,Awake brain MRSI reveals anesthetic sensitivity and regional aging effects on [<sup>13</sup>C]bicarbonate metabolism in mice.,"Abnormalities and alterations in the glycolytic pathway in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging have received much attention, as clinical applications of proton-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have recently illuminated the elevation of lactate concentrations in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate MRS has shown promise for neurological applications because it enables the real-time in vivo detection of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation flux. In studies of the mouse brain using hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate, there are few reports that the signal of [<sup>13</sup>C]bicarbonate, a product of oxidative phosphorylation metabolized from [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate, was detected using MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) that allows spatial mapping of metabolism, although there have been reports of [<sup>13</sup>C]bicarbonate signals being detected by pulse-acquire sequences in the entire brain. In the present study, we compared hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate metabolism between the brains of awake and isoflurane-anesthetized mice using a custom-made awake mouse restraint device with MRSI. Although the signal for [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate, a product of glycolysis metabolized from [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate, was detectable in multiple brain regions that include the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus in both awake and anesthetized mice, the signal for [<sup>13</sup>C]bicarbonate metabolized from [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate was only detectable in the brains of awake mice. Moreover, a comparison of hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate metabolism in young and aged mouse brains using awake MRSI detected age-related decreases in oxidative phosphorylation flux in brain regions that include the hippocampus with variations in the extent of these changes across different brain regions. These results demonstrate that hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate MRSI under awake conditions is useful for the spatial detection of abnormalities and alterations in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation flux in the brains of mice. Thus, the use of hyperpolarized [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate MRSI has potential in pathological and mechanistic studies of brain diseases and brain aging.",Front Neuroimaging
40039638,Artificial Intelligence Based Hierarchical Classification of Frontotemporal Dementia.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a typical kind of presenile dementia with three main subtypes: behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Our aim is to classify brain images of each subject into one of the spectrums of the FTD in a hierarchical order by applying data-driven techniques. Specifically, we took 300 subjects (30 bvFTD, 41 svPPA, 25 nfvPPA, 80 Alzheimer's Disease, and 124 cognitively normal) from the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative archive to validate our approach. The cortical and subcortical measurements, e.g., cortical thickness and volumetric segmentation, were extracted from MRI images for the experiment. Our proposed model yielded classification accuracy of 87.42%, 83.23%, and 82.44% with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayes methods, respectively, for five classes. We observed a significant improvement over the flat multi-class model, which has an accuracy of 82.80%, 81.27%, and 80.45%, respectively, for five classes. We also compared our proposed approach with a Convolutional Neural Networks model and ensemble with multi-layer perception as well. The results showed that the hierarchical approach performs almost equally well here as in the SVM model. Moreover, we also tested our hierarchical approach for three classes (CN, Non-FTD, FTD) to compare with state-of-the-art methods and obtained better results.Clinical relevance- This study provides a detailed understanding of the heterogeneity within the FTD subtypes; clinicians can better tailor diagnostic and treatment strategies to match each subtype's specific characteristics and progression patterns.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40147619,Cholesterol´s Role in Membrane Organization and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Function: Implications for Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Biological membranes are complex entities composed of various molecules exhibiting lateral and transbilayer lipid asymmetries, along with a selective spatial distribution of different membrane proteins. This dynamic orchestration is crucial for proper physiological functions, undergoes changes with aging, and is disturbed in several neurological disorders. In this review, we analyze the impact of disruption in this equilibrium on physiological aging and the onset of pathological conditions. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, characterized by the increased presence of the Aβ peptide, which supports the amyloid hypothesis of the disease. However, AD also involves a progressive loss of cholinergic innervation, leading to the cholinergic hypothesis of the disease. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are transmembrane proteins, and Aβ peptides, their oligomeric and fibrillar species, which increase in hydrophobicity as they develop, interact with membranes. Therefore, a membrane hypothesis of the disease emerges as a bridge between the other two. Here, we discuss the impact of the membrane environment, through direct or indirect mechanisms, on cholinergic signaling and Aβ formation and subsequent incorporation into the membrane, with a special focus on the crucial role of cholesterol in these processes.",Chem Phys Lipids
40078869,Vulnerability of the entorhinal cortex II to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive memory loss and deterioration of cognitive functions. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampal areas (perforant pathway) correlates with cognitive impairment. Pathological processing of tau protein is characterized by post-translational changes such as hyperphosphorylation and truncation, which favour conformational changes within tau. These conformational changes can be regional (dependent on phosphorylation) or structural (depending on regional conformational changes and truncation). Through immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining in hippocampus Alzheimer disease brains and quantification in tissue stained with TG3 antibody and analysed by confocal microscopy, we have been able to demonstrate that TG3 correlates with cognitive impairment. In the process of tangle evolution, TG3 is present in pre-tangle. This epitope of the TG3 antibody was very stable to proteolytic processing by caspase-3; truncation is evidenced by the TauC-3 antibody. The entorhinal cortex showed high sensitivity to neurodegeneration and pathological tau processing.",Brain Commun
40116674,Alzheimer-typical temporo-parietal atrophy and hypoperfusion are associated with a more significant cholinergic impairment in amnestic neurodegenerative syndromes.,"BackgroundTo date, cholinomimetics remain central in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, postmortem investigations indicate that the AD-typical progressive amnestic syndrome may also result from predominantly limbic non-AD neuropathology such as TDP-43 proteinopathy and argyrophilic grain disease. Experimental evidence links a beneficial response to cholinomimetics in early AD to reduced markers of cholinergic neurotransmission. However, the cholinergic impairment varies among patients with a clinical AD presentation, likely due to non-AD (co)-pathologies.ObjectiveThis study examines whether AD-typical atrophy and hypoperfusion can provide information about the cholinergic system in clinically diagnosed AD.MethodsThirty-two patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with the tracer N-methyl-4-piperidyl-acetate (MP4A) to estimate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, neurological examinations, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessment. The 'cholinergic deficit' was computed as the deviation of AChE activity from cognitively normal controls across the cerebral cortex and correlated gray matter (GM) and perfusion of temporo-parietal cortices typically affected by AD and basal forebrain (BF) GM.ResultsTemporo-parietal perfusion and GM, as well as the inferior temporal to medial temporal ratio of perfusion correlated negatively with the 'cholinergic deficit'. A smaller Ch4p area of the BF was associated with a more significant 'cholinergic deficit', albeit to a lesser degree than cortical measures.ConclusionsIn clinically diagnosed AD, temporo-parietal GM and perfusion are more closely associated with the 'cholinergic deficit' than BF volumes, making them possible markers for cholinergic treatment response in amnestic neurodegeneration.",J Alzheimers Dis
40132681,Decoding stress granules dynamics: Implications for neurodegenerative disease.,"Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less cytoplasmic structures formed by cells in response to external stress, primarily composed of mRNA and proteins. The dynamic properties of their assembly, maintenance, and disassembly play crucial roles in cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have increasingly revealed that aberrations in SGs dynamics are closely related to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review summarizes the latest research progress on SGs dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. It begins with an overview of the basic biological characteristics of SGs and their functions in neurons, followed by an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms and regulatory pathways of SGs dynamics. The review then summarizes potential therapeutic strategies targeting SGs dynamics abnormalities, particularly through small molecule drugs to modulate SGs formation and disassembly, aiming to delay or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The review also highlights the application prospects of these interventions in treating neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the review introduces current techniques used to study SGs dynamics, discussing their advantages, limitations, and future development possibilities.

40084666,Association of Alzheimer's disease genetic risk with age-dependent changes in plasma amyloid-β<sub>42:40</sub> in Veterans.,"BackgroundIdentifying biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for early diagnosis and AD risk assessment.ObjectiveWe examined the hypothesis that the plasma amyloid-β 42 and 40 (Aβ<sub>42:40</sub>) ratio has a curvilinear relationship with age among individuals who are at higher genetic risk for AD.MethodsThis study investigated the relationship between plasma amyloid-β 42 and 40 (Aβ<sub>42:40</sub>) ratio and age in 315 men and women Veterans, including those at genetic risk for AD. Hierarchical regression models investigated linear and nonlinear relationships between age, genetic risk, and Aβ<sub>42:40</sub>.ResultsWe observed a curvilinear relationship between age and Aβ<sub>42:40</sub> in individuals with higher genetic risk, characterized by an increase in the Aβ<sub>42:40</sub> during midlife followed by a decrease in older age.ConclusionsThese findings highlight distinct patterns in Aβ metabolism among genetically predisposed individuals, suggesting that early metabolic shifts may play a role in the progression of AD. Understanding these nuanced changes is essential for refining the use of Aβ<sub>42:40</sub> ratio as a biomarker, potentially leading to more accurate risk stratification and earlier intervention strategies in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40157623,Mitochondrial DNA copy number and Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson disease.,"INTRODUCTION: A systematic review on the association of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) is lacking and the causal relationship remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of observational studies on the association of mtDNA-CN with AD and PD and perform a bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate their causal relationships.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for eligible studies before Jan 2025. The causal links were conducted with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the main analysis.
RESULTS: Fourteen case-control and 2 cohort studies investigated the association between mtDNA-CN and AD, with 13 reporting decreased mtDNA-CN associated with increased risk of AD and 3 showing no significant association. All the studies (9 case-control, 1 cross-sectional, 2 cohort studies) observed the relation between mtDNA-CN and PD except for 3 studies reporting no significant association. In MR analysis, genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was not associated with AD and PD, whereas genetically predicted AD (β -0.085, 95 % CI -0.156 to -0.013; P = 0.02) but not PD was associated with mtDNA-CN. Sensitivity and replication analyses showed a stable finding.
DISCUSSION: The systematic review found limited observational studies on mtDNA-CN and AD and PD and majority were case-control study. Findings of the bidirectional MR study did not support a causal effect of mtDNA-CN in the development of AD and PD but found that AD can lead to decreased levels of mtDNA-CN, which suggest mtDNA-CN as a potential biomarker of AD.",Mitochondrion
40112813,APOE genotype determines cell-type-specific pathological landscape of Alzheimer's disease.,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk modifier for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the APOE4 allele increasing risk and APOE2 decreasing it compared with the common APOE3 allele. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the temporal cortex from APOE2 carriers, APOE3 homozygotes, and APOE4 carriers, we found that AD-associated transcriptomic changes were highly APOE genotype dependent. Comparing AD with controls, APOE2 carriers showed upregulated synaptic and myelination-related pathways, preserving synapses and myelination at the protein level. Conversely, these pathways were downregulated in APOE3 homozygotes, resulting in reduced synaptic and myelination proteins. In APOE4 carriers, excitatory neurons displayed reduced synaptic pathways similar to APOE3, but oligodendrocytes showed upregulated myelination pathways like APOE2. However, their synaptic and myelination protein levels remained unchanged or increased. APOE4 carriers also showed increased pro-inflammatory signatures in microglia but reduced responses to amyloid-β pathology. These findings reveal APOE genotype-specific molecular alterations in AD across cell types.",Neuron
39997718,In-Depth Investigation on Potential Mechanism of Forest-Grown Ginseng Alleviating Alzheimer's Disease via UHPLC-MS-Based Metabolomics.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a central nervous system degenerative disease closely related to age with a complex pathogenesis. As a natural medicinal plant, forest-grown ginseng (GSF) contains abundant ginsenosides and offers significant neuroprotective effects.
METHODS: In this study, we comprehensively investigated the effect of GSF on the cell viability of PC12 cells in an AD model alongside metabolic changes in the serum and brains of mice, combined with an efficacy evaluation of PC12 cells in vitro and UHPLC-MS-based metabolomics in vivo. The goal of this study is to clarify the potential mechanism of GSF in treating AD.
RESULTS: The PC12 cell results showed that GSF can promote the proliferation of PC12 cells, reduce the content of IL-8, increase the activity of SOD, and alleviate the inflammation and oxidative stress induced by Aβ25~35. The immunohistochemical results for the mouse brain tissue also showed that GSF could reduce the inflammatory response of mouse brain tissue by reducing the overexpression of IBa1. AD was alleviated by reducing Aβ protein deposition in the mouse brain tissue. An untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed using UHPLC-Q-Exactive MS and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the differentially expressed metabolites in the serum and brain tissue of AD mice after treatment. Twenty and seventeen different metabolites were identified in the serum and brain tissue, respectively. The pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites showed that GSF could treat AD by up-regulating succinic acid semialdehyde, carbamoyl phosphate, Sphingosine 1-phosphate, L-cystathionine, 2-ketobutyric acid, Vanillylmandelic acid, and D-Ribose to regulate sphingomyelin metabolism, the synthesis and metabolism of neurotransmitters and precursors, and energy metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: GSF can reduce neuroinflammation and alleviate Alzheimer's disease by regulating the metabolic disorders of amino acids, sphingolipids, unsaturated fatty acids, and arachidonic acid in mice serum and brain tissue metabolites. These results suggest a link between metabolite imbalance and AD, and reveal the basis for the mechanism of ginsenosides in AD treatment.",Metabolites
40034530,Pivotal trial of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy for early Alzheimer's disease: Rationale and design.,"BACKGROUND: There are lines of evidence suggesting that cerebral microcirculatory dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have developed a low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy that upregulates endothelial NO synthase with therapeutic angiogenesis. We demonstrated that the LIPUS therapy ameliorates cognitive declines in mouse models of AD and tended to do so in patients with early AD (mild AD and mild cognitive impairment due to AD) in the pilot trial. Thus, the Japanese government has designated our LIPUS device as the first breakthrough medical device in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: We are performing a pivotal clinical trial (LIPUS-AD) to finally address the efficacy and safety of our LIPUS therapy in patients with early AD in Japan.
METHODS: LIPUS-AD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which a total of 220 patients with early AD, who are positive for amyloid-β (Aβ) PET, will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The LIPUS therapy is performed for the whole brain for one hour 3 times a week as one session under the special conditions (32 cycles, 0.5 MHz, 0.25 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). It is performed for 6 sessions with 3-month intervals in the LIPUS group for 72 weeks, while the placebo group receives placebo therapy. Before and at 72 weeks of the trial, all subjects undergo brain Aβ PET and MRI and 9 cognitive functions tests. The primary efficacy endpoint is the changes in ADAS-J-cog-14 scores from baseline to 72 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS-AD addresses efficacy and safety of the LIPUS therapy in patients with early AD.Clinical Trial Gov. No.: NCT05983575.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40014129,"From computational screening to zebrafish testing: repurposing of doxazosin, donepezil, and dolutegravir for neuroprotective potential in Alzheimer's disease.","Amyloid-beta (Aß) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are distinctive features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive disorder that results in considerable memory loss and decline in cognitive function. Presently available therapies, such as donepezil and other medications that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, mainly provide relief from symptoms but do not change the course of the disease. This research article intends to investigate the possible reuse of two FDA-approved medications, doxazosin and dolutegravir, discovered through computerized screening using shape similarity, docking energy, and molecular dynamics stability, for the purpose of targeting human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the development of disease-altering treatments. In order to mimic neurotoxicity similar to Alzheimer's disease, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>). Various behavioral assessments, such as the open field test, mirror biting test, novel tank test, social preference test, and dark-light preference test, were carried out to assess cognitive function, movement, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results indicated that doxazosin, a drug that blocks alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, successfully decreased neuroinflammation and improved cognitive abilities. Additionally, dolutegravir, which is mainly used as an antiviral medication, showed notable benefits in protecting the nervous system. This study highlights the possibility of using doxazosin and dolutegravir as effective alternative treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Upcoming preclinical and clinical research is necessary to confirm the safety and effectiveness of AD treatment, paving the way for new opportunities in therapeutic intervention.",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol
40041897,YOD1 regulates microglial homeostasis by deubiquitinating MYH9 to promote the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major form of dementia in the elderly and is closely related to the toxic effects of microglia sustained activation. In AD, sustained microglial activation triggers impaired synaptic pruning, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and cognitive deficits. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aberrant expression of deubiquitinating enzymes is associated with regulating microglia function. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify a deubiquitinase YOD1 as a regulator of microglial function and AD pathology. Further study showed that YOD1 knockout significantly improved the migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory response of microglia, thereby improving the cognitive impairment of AD model mice. Through LC-MS/MS analysis combined with Co-IP, we found that Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), a key regulator maintaining microglia homeostasis, is an interacting protein of YOD1. Mechanistically, YOD1 binds to MYH9 and maintains its stability by removing the K48 ubiquitin chain from MYH9, thereby mediating the microglia polarization signaling pathway to mediate microglia homeostasis. Taken together, our study reveals a specific role of microglial YOD1 in mediating microglia homeostasis and AD pathology, which provides a potential strategy for targeting microglia to treat AD.",Acta Pharm Sin B
39987743,Taylor-dingo optimized RP-net for segmentation toward Alzheimer's disease detection and classification using deep learning.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a significant cause of mortality in elderly people. The diagnosing and classification of AD using conventional manual operation is a challenging issue. Here, a novel scheme, namely Recurrent Prototypical Network with Taylor Dingo Optimizer- enabled Deep Neuro Fuzzy Network (RP-Net_TaylorDOX-based DNFN) is devised for classifying the AD from input image. Here, the brain image is considered as the input for AD severity classification, and pre-processing is then processed by a median filter and Region of Interest (RoI). Later, segmentation of the ROI extracted image is done by RP-Net. Here, the parameters of RP-Net are tuned using the Taylor Dingo Optimizer (TaylorDOX), which is developed by the integration of the Taylor series with the Dingo Optimizer (DOX). Once finishing segmentation is performed, feature extraction is effectuated to mine the important features. After that, data augmentation is accomplished based on the oversampling technique. Moreover, AD detection is accomplished by utilizing a Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN), which is trained by the TaylorDOX. Finally, severity classification is effectuated utilizing DNFN structurally optimized by TaylorDOX. Furthermore, the effectiveness of RP-Net_TaylorDOX-based DNFN is calculated depending on the segmentation accuracy, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and has obtained values of 92.13 %, 92.30 %, 93.62 %, and 91.52 % correspondingly.",Comput Biol Chem

40143289,"Chronic, Low-Dose Methamphetamine Reveals Sexual Dimorphism of Memory Performance, Histopathology, and Gene Expression Affected by HIV-1 Tat Protein in a Transgenic Model of NeuroHIV.","Methamphetamine (METH) use is frequent among people with HIV (PWH) and appears to increase the risk of neuronal injury and neurocognitive impairment (NCI). This study explored in vivo the effects of a 12 week (long-term), low-dose METH regimen in a transgenic animal model of neuroHIV with inducible expression of HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat). Seven months after transient Tat induction and five months after METH exposure ended, we detected behavioral changes in the Barnes maze (BM) spatial memory task in the Tat and METH groups but not the combined Tat + METH group. The novel object recognition (NOR) task revealed that Tat extinguished discrimination in female animals with and without METH, although METH alone slightly improved NOR. In contrast, in males, Tat, METH, and Tat + METH all compromised NOR. Neuropathological examination detected sex-dependent and brain region-specific changes of pre-synaptic terminals, neurites, and activation of astrocytes and microglia. RNA-sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that METH and Tat significantly altered gene expression, including factors linked to Alzheimer's disease-like NCI. In summary, chronic low-dose METH exerts long-term effects on behavioral function, neuropathology, and mRNA expression, and modulates the effects of Tat, suggesting sex-dependent and -independent mechanisms may converge in HIV brain injury and NCI.",Viruses
40038788,Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with substantial genetic influence. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci for late-onset AD (LOAD), the functional mechanisms underlying most of these associations remain unresolved. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), represent a promising avenue for elucidating such mechanisms within some of these loci.
METHODS: By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing 20,205 common SVs from 1088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits were examined.
RESULTS: First, we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with the phenotypes tested. The strongest association was a deletion of an Alu element in the 3'UTR of the TMEM106B gene, in high LD with the respective AD GWAS locus and associated with multiple AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD) phenotypes, including tangles density, TDP-43, and cognitive resilience. The deletion of this element was also linked to lower TMEM106B protein abundance. We also found a 22-kb deletion associated with depression in ROS/MAP and bearing similar association patterns as GWAS SNPs at the IQCK locus. In addition, we leveraged our catalog of SV-GWAS to replicate and characterize independent findings in SV-based GWAS for AD and five other neurodegenerative diseases. Among these findings, we highlight the replication of genome-wide significant SVs for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), including markers for the 17q21.31 MAPT locus inversion and a 1483-bp deletion at the CYP2A13 locus, along with other suggestive associations, such as a 994-bp duplication in the LMNTD1 locus, suggestively linked to AD and a 3958-bp deletion at the DOCK5 locus linked to Lewy body disease (LBD) (P = 3.36 × 10<sup>-4</sup>).
CONCLUSIONS: While still limited in sample size, this study highlights the utility of including analysis of SVs for elucidating mechanisms underlying GWAS loci and provides a valuable resource for the characterization of the effects of SVs in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.",Genome Med
40137398,The Influence of a Specialized Dementia Ward on the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"Background: Hospitalization for severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents challenges, often requiring environments that ensure safety while addressing therapeutic needs. Traditional closed wards, originally designed for psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, may not fully address the unique needs of AD patients. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Specialized Dementia Ward (SDW) tailored for AD patients compared to a General Ward (GW). Methods: A retrospective study compared 51 AD patients in an SDW (February 2018-January 2019) and 40 AD patients in a GW (December 2017-January 2018). Patients met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) ≤ 2 and a Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) ≤ 20. Clinical assessments at admission and four weeks included K-MMSE, Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set Version 2.0 (RAI-MDS), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Psychotropic medication use, length of stay, and discharge destination were also analyzed. Results: No statistically significant differences emerged between SDW and GW groups regarding baseline demographics, cognitive function, ADL, or neuropsychiatric symptoms. At four weeks, both groups exhibited trends toward improved K-MMSE, RAI-MDS, and NPI-Q scores and reduced psychotropic usage, but these did not reach statistical significance. Although mean length of stay was shorter for SDW patients (3.2 vs. 4.9 months; p = 0.078), the difference was not significant. Notably, a significantly higher proportion of SDW patients were discharged home (58.8% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.049).

40086889,Natural Products Targeting Tau Protein Phosphorylation: A Promising Therapeutic Avenue for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tau protein hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation, which are central to its pathogenesis. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of natural products in targeting tau phosphorylation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease progression. It comprehensively summarizes current research on various natural compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, polysaccharides, phenols, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids, highlighting their multitarget mechanisms, such as modulating kinases and phosphatases. The ability of these compounds to mitigate oxidative stress, inflammation, and tau pathology while enhancing cognitive function underscores their value as potential anti-Alzheimer's disease therapeutics. By integrating recent advances in extraction methods, pharmacological studies, and artificial intelligence-driven screening technologies, this review provides a valuable reference for future research and development of natural product-based interventions for Alzheimer's disease.",Planta Med
40125804,High-Frequency rTMS Improves Visual Working Memory in Patients With aMCI: A Cognitive Neural Mechanism Study.,"BACKGROUND: Visual working memory (VWM), which is an essential component of higher cognitive processes, declines with age and is associated with the progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive impairment, particularly in VWM, is prominent in aMCI and may indicate disease progression. This study investigates the cognitive neural mechanisms responsible for VWM impairment in aMCI, with a focus on identifying the VWM processing stages affected. The study targets the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate its influence on VWM in aMCI patients. The role of the DLPFC in the top-down control of VWM processing is central to understanding rTMS effects on the stages of information processing in aMCI-related VWM impairments.
METHODS: A 7-day rTMS intervention was performed in 25 aMCI patients and 15 healthy elderly controls to investigate its effects on VWM and cognitive functions. Tasks included VWM change detection, digital symbol transformation, and the Stroop task for attention and executive functions. EEG analyses consisting of ERP, ERSP, and functional connectivity (wPLI) were integrated. The first part of the study addressed the cognitive neural mechanism of VWM impairment in aMCI and differentiated the processing stages using EEG. The second part investigated the effects of rTMS on EEG processing at different VWM stages and revealed cognitive neural mechanisms that improve visual working memory in aMCI.
RESULTS: The results indicated a significant deterioration of VWM tasks in aMCI, especially in accuracy and memory capacity, with prolonged reaction time and increased duration of the Stroop task. In the VWM memory encoding phase, N2pc amplitude, α-oscillation in the parieto-occipital region, and θ-band synchronization in the frontoparietal connectivity decreased. Conversely, rTMS improved N2pc amplitude, α-oscillation, and θ-band synchronization, which correlated with improved frontoparietal connectivity, parieto-occipital α-oscillation, and attentional capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aMCI experience significant deterioration in VWM function, particularly during the encoding phase. This deterioration manifests in reduced accuracy and capacity of memory performance, accompanied by a significant decrease in N2pc amplitude, alpha oscillations, and theta-band connectivity in frontoparietal and fronto-occipital brain regions. rTMS proves to be a promising intervention that improves VWM, attention, and executive functions. In particular, it supports attention during target selection by increasing N2pc amplitude during encoding, enhancing alpha oscillations for better suppression of irrelevant information, and increasing synchronization in frontoparietal and occipital functional connectivity, which ultimately improves visual working memory.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40011556,Behavioral and pathological characteristics of 5xFAD female mice in the early stage.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system degenerative disease with insidious onset and gradual development caused by selective and progressive loss of neurons. The 5xFAD mouse is a relatively mature disease model of AD. However, the behavioral research on 5xFAD female mouse is more focused on the changes of late memory function, and the exploration of its early behavioral and pathological changes is still incomplete. This research aims to explore the changes in memory function, emotional function (including anxiety and depression), motor ability, amyloid plaques, glial cell response and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of female 5xFAD mice in the early stage, laying a foundation for a comprehensive exploration of the disease mechanism of AD. The results of this study found that early 4-month-old female 5xFAD mice mainly showed a decline in memory function without other dysfunction. Accompanied by a large amount of amyloid protein plaques deposited in the hippocampus, it induced the response of microglia and astrocytes, and neurogenesis decreased significantly with age, especially in early female 5xFAD mice, which resulted in a decrease in the number of new neurons. This may be an important reason for the decline in memory function of female 5xFAD mice in the early stage.",Sci Rep
40121822,Altered cerebellar activation patterns in Alzheimer's disease: An activation likelihood estimation Meta-Analysis.,"The past decade has seen an increased interest in the cerebellum, particularly in non-motor behaviors. Emerging work across model systems and in humans has also implicated the cerebellum in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While the cerebellum is not seen as being central to the etiology of the disease, it is however recognized as being increasingly important, and most certainly not immune from disease-related pathology and atrophy. In cognitively normal older adults (OA), the cerebellum has been conceptualized as being critical scaffolding for cortical function. This scaffolding may extend to AD and MCI. With respect to functional imaging, this is largely unexplored in AD, as this is a nascent literature. While there are very few studies focused on the cerebellum in AD at this stage, meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for expanding our knowledge of the cerebellum in neurodegenerative disease, and, in turn, for hypothesis generation. We took advantage of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to investigate overlap in functional activation present in the existing literature. We focused on AD, but also included an exploratory analysis of MCI, based on papers available in our AD search. Our analysis included a total of 29 studies, representing data from 236 individuals with AD, 159 with MCI, and 382 OA. Across these studies, there is no significant overlap in cerebellar activation in AD, though this is present in MCI. Analyses of group differences also suggest that across studies, there are patterns indicative of both greater and reduced activation in AD/MCI relative to OA. Across all findings, overlap was primarily centered on Crus I and Lobule VI. These findings suggest that cerebellar function is negatively impacted in AD, which in turn may impact behavior and symptomatology.",Neuroimage Clin
40076442,Biomarker Identification for Alzheimer's Disease Using a Multi-Filter Gene Selection Approach.,"There is still a lack of effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia and cognitive decline. Identifying reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial for advancing AD research. In this study, we developed an aggregative multi-filter gene selection approach to identify AD biomarkers. This method integrates hub gene ranking techniques, such as degree and bottleneck, with feature selection algorithms, including Random Forest and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance, and applies ranking aggregation to improve accuracy and robustness. Five publicly available AD-related microarray datasets (GSE48350, GSE36980, GSE132903, GSE118553, and GSE5281), covering diverse brain regions like the hippocampus and frontal cortex, were analyzed, yielding 803 overlapping differentially expressed genes from 464 AD and 492 normal cases. An independent dataset (GSE109887) was used for external validation. The approach identified 50 prioritized genes, achieving an AUC of 86.8 in logistic regression on the validation dataset, highlighting their predictive value. Pathway analysis revealed involvement in critical biological processes such as synaptic vesicle cycles, neurodegeneration, and cognitive function. These findings provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for AD.",Int J Mol Sci
39975850,Investigating shared risk variants and genetic etiology between Alzheimer's disease and three stress-related psychiatric disorders: a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have reported that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a greater burden of comorbidities typically associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders. However, the contribution of hereditary factors to this comorbidity remains unclear. We evaluated phenotypic associations using observational data from the UK Biobank.
METHOD: Our study focused on investigating the shared risk variants and genetic etiology underlying AD and three stress-related psychiatric disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. By leveraging summary statistics from genome-wide association studies, we investigated global genetic correlations using linkage disequilibrium score regression, genetic covariance analysis, and high-definition likelihood. Genome-wide cross-trait analysis with association analysis based on subsets and cross-phenotype association were performed to discover genome-wide significant risk variants shared between AD and the three stress-related psychiatric disorders.
RESULTS: A significant positive genetic correlation was observed between AD and major depressive disorder using linkage disequilibrium score regression (rg = 0.231; P = 0.018), genetic covariance analysis (rg = 0.138; P &lt; 0.001), and high-definition likelihood (rg = 0.188; P &lt; 0.001). Association analysis based on subsets and cross-phenotype association revealed thirteen risk variants in six genes shared between AD and post-traumatic stress disorder; seven risk variants in four genes shared between AD and anxiety disorder; and 23 risk variants in four genes shared between AD and major depressive disorder. Functional annotation and gene-set enrichment analysis indicated that 12 genes for comorbidity shared between patients with AD and all three stress-related psychiatric disorders were enriched in the spleen, pancreas, and whole blood.
CONCLUSION: These results advance our knowledge of the shared genetic origins of comorbidities and pave the way for advancements in the diagnosis, management, and prevention of stress-related AD.",Front Aging

Disorders in zinc homeostasis are connected to several neurological disorders due to inflammation and oxidative stress. This review explores the effect of zinc on neurological disorders through the Nrf2 signaling pathway. The Nrf2 pathway modulates oxidative stress and regulates antioxidant defenses, which is critical in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. We provide an overview of in vivo and in vitro studies illustrating zinc's neuroprotective effects in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, and stroke. The dual role of zinc, where both excess and deficiency can be detrimental, is highlighted, emphasizing the need for optimal zinc levels. Limitations of current research and future perspectives are also discussed.",J Trace Elem Med Biol
40082380,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress: Implications in Diseases.,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a specialized organelle that plays a significant role in cellular function. The major functions of ER include protein synthesis and transport, folding of proteins, biosynthesis of lipids, calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) storage, and redox balance. The loss of ER integrity results in the induction of ER stress within the cell due to the accumulation of unfolded, improperly folded proteins or changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism and redox balance of organelle. This ER stress commences the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) that serves to counteract the ER stress via three sensors inositol requiring protein-1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) that serve to establish ER homeostasis and alleviates ER stress. Severe ER dysfunction ultimately results in the induction of apoptosis. Increasing shreds of evidence suggest the implication of ER stress in the development and progression of several diseases viz. tuberculosis, malaria, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cancer. Activation of ER stress can be beneficial for treating some diseases while inhibiting the process can be useful in others. A deeper understanding of these pathways can provide key insights in designing novel therapeutics to treat these diseases.",Protein J
39984496,PTP-3 regulated by VB12 is important for ageing health in C. elegans.,"Ageing is associated with cognitive decline, which is a significant factor in the development of dementia. Vitamin B12 (VB12) is crucial for maintaining proper nervous system function, as well as for protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, and DNA synthesis. Moreover, it helps prevent serious health conditions such as pernicious anemia, neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer's disease. VB12 deficiency is common among the elderly population. We found that serum VB12 levels were significantly elevated in centenarians. Interestingly, VB12 supplementation delayed aging but also improved learning and memory in nematodes. Our results suggest that increasing VB12 activates ptp-3 and helps maintain good cognitive function in centenarians. Furthermore, aging is the gradual decline in bodily functions that impacts nearly all living organisms, with significant effects on salivary glands. Salivary gland degeneration may contribute to VB12 deficiency in the elderly, underscoring the crucial role of salivary regulation in VB12 absorption for centenarians.",NPJ Aging
40117490,Reengineering of Circularly Permuted Caspase-2 to Enhance Enzyme Stability and Enable Crystallographic Studies.,"Caspase activation has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory conditions, generating interest in targeting this family of proteases for drug development. Caspase-2 (Casp2) in particular has been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by cleaving tau protein into fragment Δtau314, which reversibly impairs cognitive and synaptic function. Thus, Casp2 inhibition could be a useful strategy for therapeutic treatment of AD. To that end, we have previously synthesized and characterized various series of peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors that demonstrate potency and selectivity for Casp2 over caspase-3 (Casp3). Despite promising developments in the design of selective Casp2 inhibitors, low expression yields of Casp2 hinder crystallographic experiments and make structure-based design challenging. The design of circularly permuted (cp) Casp2 increased protein yields considerably; however, this protein could not be crystallized. This article describes the characterization of ten novel cpCasp2 mutants, designed with the goal of increasing stability and facilitating crystallization. Gratifyingly, engineered mutant JF1cpCasp2 displayed high relative stability and was readily crystallizable with the canonical Casp2 inhibitor AcVDVAD-CHO, leading to what we believe to be the first crystal structures of any reverse caspase in the PDB. Moreover, we have reported the structure of JF1cpCasp2 with our recently described Casp2-selective inhibitor MUR-65, which revealed a unique interaction with Arg417 in the binding pocket. Overall, JF1cpCasp2 has proven valuable for structure-based design and expanding understanding of Casp2 inhibition, with potential implications for drug discovery and the development of more selective compounds.",ACS Chem Biol

CSF1R is considered a hallmark of inflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Our study aims to evaluate the potential value of 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-([<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide ([<sup>18</sup>F]JNJ-CSF1R-1) as a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand targeting CSF1R in preclinical models of neuroinflammation.
PROCEDURES: A cell-based MSD assay was used to measure the IC<sub>50</sub> of 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-(fluoro)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide (JNJ-CSF1R-1).

CSF1R protein levels in brain tissue were determined by western blot and ELISA assays. [<sup>18</sup>F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 brain uptake was also measured in a non-human primate (NHP) PET study.
RESULTS: JNJ-CSF1R-1 is a 12 nM (IC<sub>50</sub>) inhibitor of CSF1R. ​[<sup>18</sup>F]JNJ-CSF1R-1 demonstrated significantly higher brain uptake in both LPS and AD mouse models as measured by the area under the time activity curves (AUC) compared to control animals.

All credit goes to the researchers who played a crucial role in curbing COVID-19 and proved our medical technology supremacy. However, COVID-19 has left some mysterious scars on human well-being. It is believed that COVID-19 has a significant negative impact on various cardiovascular (CVS) and central nervous system (CNS) diseases, especially in the case of CNS diseases like Alzheimer's. Surprisingly, COVID-19 affects the respiratory system, whereas Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters brain function. To explain this phenomenon, several hypotheses were proposed, but the mechanism needs to be clearly understood.

40034345,Alzheimer's disease: A case study involving EEG-based fE/I ratio and pTau-181 protein analysis through nasal administration of Saraswata Ghrita.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory, language, and cognitive functions and currently has no definitive cure. Saraswata Ghrita (SG), a traditional Ayurvedic remedy administered nasally, offers a holistic approach and is believed to directly affect brain functions through its unique delivery route.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SG in improving cognitive function and neurochemical biomarkers in a patient with AD. Key outcomes included electroencephalography-based excitation/inhibition (fE/I) ratio, and levels of phosphorylated Tau-181 (pTau-181), serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
METHODS: A 90-day proof-of-concept clinical trial was conducted with one AD patient. Nasal administration of SG was performed twice daily. Measurements included EEG spectral power analysis across 1-48 Hz, cognitive function assessed by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) scales, and biochemical analyses of pTau-181, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and DHEA.
RESULTS: Notable improvements were observed: ADAS-Cog score decreased from 40 to 36, QoL-AD score increased from 23 to 31, MMSE score improved from 13 to 18, and MoCA score increased from 8 to 13. Biochemical markers showed a decrease in pTau-181 (12.50 pg/ml to 6.28 pg/ml), an increase in acetylcholine (13.73 pg/ml to 31.83 pg/ml), while serotonin and DHEA levels rose, and dopamine levels decreased (39.14 pg/ml to 36.21 pg/ml).
CONCLUSIONS: SG demonstrated potential in enhancing cognitive functions and neurochemical markers in AD, with the nasal route proving safe and effective. These findings suggest the value of traditional Ayurvedic treatments in contemporary AD management.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

40089262,Pharmacological landscape of endoplasmic reticulum stress: Uncovering therapeutic avenues for metabolic diseases.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper protein folding, lipid metabolism, and calcium regulation. However, disruptions to ER function, known as ER stress, activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore balance. Chronic or unresolved ER stress contributes to metabolic dysfunctions, including insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs) and ER-associated inflammation in disease progression. This review explores the current pharmacological landscape targeting ER stress, focusing on therapeutic strategies for rare metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. It examines small molecules such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), repurposed drugs like 17-AAG (17-N-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (tanespimycin)) and berberine, and phytochemicals such as resveratrol and hesperidin. Additionally, it discusses emerging therapeutic areas, including soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors for metabolic disorders and MERCs modulation for neurological diseases. The review emphasizes challenges in translating these therapies to clinical applications, such as toxicity, off-target effects, limited bioavailability, and the lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It also highlights the potential of personalized medicine approaches and pharmacogenomics in optimizing ER stress-targeting therapies.",Eur J Pharmacol

DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective cohort study.
SETTING: 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1FLADRC).
PARTICIPANTS: 97 older adults aged 54 to 98 years who were diagnosed with aMCI following a baseline evaluation. The average age was 71.9 years, 51 % male, average education 15.7 years, and 56 % Hispanic. The mean MMSE score was 28.0. Participants were followed annually for 3 to 4 visits with a mean follow-up time of 38.9 months (range 22.7 to 70.3 months).
MEASUREMENTS: CDR-SOB were obtained at each visit and the latent growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB was estimated. The associations between PSI and frPSI and the growth curve trajectory of CDR-SOB were examined.
RESULTS: The growth curve model that best fits the CDR-SOB trajectory was a linear form and included the fixed and random effect of intercept and slope of time. After adjusting for age, sex, education, Hispanic background, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) immediate and delayed recall, and amyloid positivity, frPSI (β = -0.134, se=0.04, p < 0.01) remained statistically significant in predicting a steeper slope on the trajectory of decline in CDR-SOB.

40037332,Mendelian randomization identifies proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Proteins are involved in multiple biological functions. High-throughput technologies have allowed the measurement of thousands of proteins in population biobanks. In this study, we aimed to identify proteins related to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by leveraging large-scale genetic and proteomic data. We performed a two-sample cis Mendelian randomization study by selecting instrumental variables for the abundance of >2700 proteins measured by either Olink or SomaScan platforms in plasma from the UK Biobank and the deCODE Health Study. We also used the latest publicly available genome-wide association studies for the neurodegenerative diseases of interest. The potentially causal effect of proteins on neurodegenerative diseases was estimated based on the Wald ratio. We tested 13 377 protein-disease associations, identifying 169 associations that were statistically significant (5% false discovery rate). Evidence of co-localization between plasma protein abundance and disease risk (posterior probability > 0.80) was identified for 61 protein-disease pairs, leading to 50 unique protein-disease associations. Notably, 23 of 50 protein-disease associations corresponded to genetic loci not previously reported by genome-wide association studies. The two-sample Mendelian randomization and co-localization analysis also showed that APOE abundance in plasma was associated with three subcortical volumes (hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens) and white matter hyper-intensities, whereas PILRA and PILRB abundance in plasma was associated with caudate nucleus volume. Our study provided a comprehensive assessment of the effect of the human proteome that is currently measurable through two different platforms on neurodegenerative diseases. The newly associated proteins indicated the involvement of complement (C1S and C1R), microglia (SIRPA, SIGLEC9 and PRSS8) and lysosomes (CLN5) in Alzheimer's disease; the interleukin-6 pathway (CTF1) in Parkinson's disease; lysosomes (TPP1), blood-brain barrier integrity (MFAP2) and astrocytes (TNFSF13) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and blood-brain barrier integrity (VEGFB), oligodendrocytes (PARP1), node of Ranvier and dorsal root ganglion (NCS1, FLRT3 and CDH15) and the innate immune system (CR1, AHSG and WARS) in multiple sclerosis.

Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance Aβ-targeted immunotherapies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.",Nat Med
40163534,Efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapies targeting amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: While recently U.S. FDA-approved anti-amyloid beta (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer new treatment approaches for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), these medications also carry potential safety concerns and uncertainty about their efficacy for improving cognitive function. This study presents an updated meta-analysis of cognitive outcomes and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs from phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with sporadic AD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled blinded trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anti-Aβ mAbs in patients with AD were identified through a search in clinical trials.gov, PubMed and Embase on January 14th, 2024. The retrieved studies were further screened from January 15th, 2024, to February 14th, 2024. We included studies that had been published in any language. Quality of trials was assessed using the Jadad score and publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and Funnel plot. Primary outcomes were mean changes from baseline to post-treatment in Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores, and secondary outcomes were adverse events including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E), and ARIA with hemorrhage (ARIA-H). Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were conducted. The literature search identified 13 phase III RCTs, which included 18,826 patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Compared with placebo, treatment with mAbs significantly improved cognitive performance on CDR-SB (mean difference -0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.38, -0.11]) and ADAS-Cog (standardized mean difference -0.09, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.06]), in which a negative change indicates improvement for both scores. Meta-regression analysis suggested that trials enrolling patients with early-stage AD were associated with better efficacy. Elevated risk of ARIA-E (risk ratio [RR] 9.79, 95% CI [5.32,18.01]), ARIA-H (RR 1.94, 95% CI [1.47,2.57]), and headaches (RR 1.21, 95% CI [1.10,1.32]) were noted. Statistical heterogeneity was relatively high for ARIA-E and ARIA-H, leading to wide confidence intervals and considerable variability in effect sizes, though meta-regression was conducted to address this. Furthermore, differences in trial designs introduce limitations in cross-trial comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Aβ mAb therapy slows cognitive decline, but with small effect sizes, and raises potential concerns about ARIA and headaches.",PLoS Med
40163948,Biosensing of single-nucleotide polymorphism: Technological advances and their transformative applications on health.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are important genetic changes related to many diseases such as breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and β-thalassemia. Because of the increased interest in biosensor technologies, there has been a notable surge in the creation of new techniques to identify these changes in recent years. These new methods are highly accurate and sensitive, cost-effective and fast, making them ideal for use in clinical analysis. The non-invasive nature of biosensing techniques further enhances their integration into clinical protocols and point-of-care diagnostics. Several electrochemical, optical, and mass-based biosensors are carefully examined in this extensive review; each is distinguished by unique sensing platforms and techniques. This review presents in-depth discussions of linear dynamic ranges, detection limits, and real-world applications of contemporary research in the diagnosis of biological substrate disorders.",Biosens Bioelectron
40091054,Atg5 in microglia regulates sex-specific effects on postnatal neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Female Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients display greater cognitive deficits and worse AD pathology as compared to male AD patients. In this study, we found that conditional knockout (cKO) of Atg5 in female microglia failed to obtain disease-associated microglia (DAM) gene signatures in familiar AD mouse model (5xFAD). Next, we analyzed the maintenance and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) from 5xFAD mice with Atg5 cKO. Our data indicated that Atg5 cKO reduced the NSC number in hippocampus of female but not male 5xFAD mice. However, in the SVZ, Atg5 cKO only impaired NSCs in male 5xFAD mice. Interestingly, female 5xFAD;Fip200 cKO mice and 5xFAD;Atg14 cKO mice did not show NSC defects. These autophagy genes cKO 5xFAD mice exhibited a higher neurogenesis activity in their SVZ. Together, our data indicate a sex-specific role for microglial Atg5 in postnatal neurogenesis in AD mice.",NPJ Aging
40159237,Differential senolytic inhibition of normal versus Aβ-associated cholinesterases: implications in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging and the age-related condition, Alzheimer's disease (AD). How senescence contributes to cholinergic and neuropathologic changes in AD remains uncertain. Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between senescence and cholinesterases (ChEs). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are important in neurotransmission, cell cycle regulation, and AD amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Senolytic agents have shown therapeutic promise in AD models. Therefore, we evaluated in vitro and in silico activity of senolytics, dasatinib (1), nintedanib (2), fisetin (3), quercetin (4), GW2580 (5), and nootropic, meclofenoxate hydrochloride (6), toward AChE and BChE. As ChEs associated with AD pathology have altered biochemical properties, we also evaluated agents 1-6 in AD brain tissues. Enzyme kinetics showed agents 1, 3, 4, and 6 inhibited both ChEs, while 2 and 5 inhibited only AChE. Histochemistry showed inhibition of Aβ plaque-associated ChEs (1 and 2: both ChEs; 5: BChE; 6: AChE), but not normal neural-associated ChEs. Modeling studies showed 1-6 interacted with the same five binding locations of both ChEs, some of which may be allosteric sites. These agents may exert their beneficial effects, in part, by inhibiting ChEs associated with AD pathology and provide new avenues for development of next-generation inhibitors targeting pathology-associated ChEs.",Aging (Albany NY)
40152561,The Potential Role of Neurogranin in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by the excessive deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Numerous new studies also indicate that synaptic damage and loss play crucial roles in AD and form the basis of cognitive impairment. In recent years, synaptic-related proteins have emerged as important biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. Among these proteins, neurogranin (Ng), a postsynaptic protein widely present in the dendritic spines of the associative cortex in the brain, plays a significant role in memory, learning, synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation (LTP). This review aims to reveal the link between Ng and AD, as well as the potential for the diagnosis of AD, the prediction of the development of the disease, and the identification of a therapeutic target for AD.",J Integr Neurosci
40015276,BACE1-dependent cleavage of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor contributes to neural hyperexcitability and disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neural hyperexcitability has been clinically associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that decreased GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) currents are linked to hippocampal granule cell hyperexcitability in the AD mouse model APP23. Elevated levels of β-secretase (BACE1), the β-secretase responsible for generating Aβ peptides, lead to aberrant cleavage of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β1/2/3 subunits in the brains of APP23 mice and AD patients. Moreover, BACE1-dependent cleavage of the β subunits leads to a decrease in GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibitory currents in BACE1 transgenic mice. Finally, we show that the neural hyperexcitability, Aβ load, and spatial memory deficit phenotypes of APP23 mice are significantly reduced upon the granule cell expression of a non-cleavable β3 subunit mutant. Collectively, our study establishes that BACE1-dependent cleavage of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β subunits promotes the pathological hyperexcitability known to drive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in the AD brain, suggesting that prevention of the cleavage could slow disease progression.",Neuron
40088743,Schisandra total lignans ameliorate neuronal ferroptosis in 3xTg-AD mice via regulating NADK/NADPH/GSH pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatments. Schisandra total lignans (STL), the primary active component of Schisandra chinensis, shows potential in alleviating AD-related symptoms, though the mechanisms remain unclear.
PURPOSE: Considering the promoting effect of neuronal ferroptosis on AD and the neuroprotective activity of STL, this study aimed to investigate the impact of STL on AD neuronal ferroptosis and elucidate its underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: This study used 3xTg-AD mice and SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing APPswe as models. UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS was applied for identifying components in STL extract and the plasma of 3xTg-AD mice, as well as to detect cellular endogenous metabolites for one-carbon metabolism analysis. Behavioral tests, including the Y maze, novel object recognition, Morris water maze, and open field, were conducted to assess the cognitive function and emotional state. Histopathological examinations were performed using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and transmission electron microscopy. The GSH, GSSG, NAD(H), NADP(H), and MDA levels, as well as GPX and GR activity were measured using assay kits. ROS, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and lipid peroxidation levels were detected with probes. Protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and cellular thermal shift assay were performed to analyze the STL-NADK interactions.
RESULTS: Behavioral tests indicated that STL alleviated cognitive impairments and anxiety in 3xTg-AD mice. Histological analysis showed that STL decreased hippocampal Aβ levels, inhibited hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis, and mitigated synaptic damage. Cellular assays demonstrated that STL alleviated APPswe overexpression-induced ferroptosis and synaptic damage by activating the NADK/NADPH/GSH pathway, with NADK knockdown abolishing this neuroprotective effect of STL. Computational analysis and cellular thermal shift assay identified Gomisin D as the key STL component with strong affinity for NADK, driving its neuroprotective effects.
CONCLUSION: NADK emerges as a novel potential therapeutic target for AD, with STL activating NADK, promoting NADPH and GSH production, thereby mitigating neuronal ferroptosis in AD.",Phytomedicine

METHODS: This study was conducted on 100 serum samples of Alzheimer's patients. DNA extraction was performed on the samples with the Cinnaclone kit and PCR techniques were used to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Varicella zoster virus. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, and IL-10 genes with a Smobio kit.
RESULTS: The relative changes in the expression of TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, and IL-10 genes were observed in Alzheimer's patients compared to the control samples without microorganisms, and a significant increase was observed (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the cytokines TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, and IL-10, have an increase in Alzheimer's patients(P < 0.05). Therefore, the presence of the microorganisms accompanied by the rise and inducing the expression of cytokines compared to the groups without the mentioned microorganisms causes a significant increase in the production of cytokines effective in the occurrence or exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease.",Neurosci Lett
40070152,A Brain-Penetrating Foldamer Rescues Aβ Aggregation-Associated Alzheimer's Disease Phenotypes in In Vivo Models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia, affecting nearly 55 million people across the world. One of the central pathological factors associated with AD is the aggregation of Aβ<sub>42</sub>, a peptide product cleaved through pathological processes in AD. Under pathological conditions, Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregates into insoluble plaques in the brain and impairs the function of neurons, which contributes to the cognitive decline associated with AD. Therefore, the modulation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation is considered a potential therapeutic intervention for AD. Using an Oligoquinoline-based foldamer library, we have identified a potent foldamer antagonist (SK-131) of Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation. SK-131 inhibits the aggregation by inducing a α-helical structure in monomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub>. Here, we demonstrated that SK-131 rescues Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation-associated phenotypes in AD cellular and multiple Caenorhabditis elegans AD models, including intracellular inhibition of Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation, rescue of behavioral deficits, and attenuation of reactive oxygen species. It efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier and demonstrates favorable pharmaceutical properties. It also potently inhibits Zn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation by potentially displacing Zn<sup>2+</sup> from Aβ<sub>42</sub>. In summary, we have identified a potent brain-penetrating foldamer that efficiently rescues AD phenotypes in in vivo models. Unlike most of the therapeutic approaches that target Aβ aggregates, we have identified and validated a novel therapeutic pathway by inducing structural change in Aβ and rescuing AD phenotypes in in vivo models. This study will further aid in the quest to identify lead therapeutics to slow or stop the progression of AD.",ACS Chem Neurosci
39996723,Peripheral Immune Profiles in Individuals at Genetic Risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease.,"The immune system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explored whether blood immune cell profiles are already altered in healthy individuals with a genetic predisposition to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using multicolor flow cytometry, we analyzed 92 immune cell phenotypes in the blood of 448 healthy participants from the Berlin Aging Study II. We calculated polygenic risk scores (PGSs) using genome-wide significant SNPs from recent large genome-wide association studies on ALS and AD. Linear regression analyses were then performed of the immune cell types on the PGSs in both the overall sample and a subgroup of older participants (&gt;60 years). While we did not find any significant associations between immune cell subtypes and ALS and AD PGSs when controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR = 0.05), we observed several nominally significant results (p &lt; 0.05) with consistent effect directions across strata. The strongest association was observed with CD57+ CD8+ early-memory T cells and ALS risk (p = 0.006). Other immune cell subtypes associated with ALS risk included PD-1+ CD8+ and CD57+ CD4+ early-memory T cells, non-classical monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells. For AD, naïve CD57+ CD8+ T cells and mature NKG2A+ natural killer cells showed nominally significant associations. We did not observe major immune cell changes in individuals at high genetic risk of ALS or AD, suggesting they may arise later in disease progression. Additional studies are required to validate our nominally significant findings.",Cells
40078532,Optical attenuation coefficient decorrelation-based optical coherence tomography angiography for microvascular evaluation of Alzheimer's disease on mice.,"SIGNIFICANCE: The deep cortical microvasculature is closely linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, tail artifacts from superficial cortical vessels often interfere with detecting deep vessels in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging. A more accurate method to assess deep cortical vasculature is crucial for understanding its relationship with AD onset.
AIM: We aim to reduce superficial vessel artifacts in OCTA imaging and improve the visualization and analysis of deep cortical microvasculature in an AD mouse model.
APPROACH: We introduced the optical attenuation coefficient decorrelation (OACD) method for OCTA, effectively reducing tail artifacts from superficial cortex vessels. This method was used to visualize and quantitatively analyze deep cortical microvasculature in vivo in a mouse model of AD.
RESULTS: The OACD method significantly reduced superficial vessel artifacts, leading to clearer imaging of the deep cortical vasculature. Quantitative analysis revealed that changes in the deep cortical microvasculature were more pronounced than in the superficial vasculature, suggesting a more direct involvement of the deep vessels in AD progression.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed OACD method enhances OCTA imaging by reducing tail artifacts from superficial vessels, facilitating improved assessment of deep cortical microvasculature. These findings suggest that deep cortical vascular changes may play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD, offering potential insights for early detection and monitoring of AD progression.",Neurophotonics
40027401,Incidence and Risk Factors of Lower Limb Deep Vein Thrombosis in Psychiatric Inpatients by Applying Machine Learning to Electronic Health Records: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric inpatients face an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to their psychiatric conditions and pharmacological treatments. However, research focusing on this population remains limited.
METHODS: This study analyzed 17,434 psychiatric inpatients at Huzhou Third Municipal Hospital, incorporating data on demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, physical illnesses, laboratory results, and medication use. Predictive models for DVT were developed using logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). Feature importance was assessed using the random forest model.
RESULTS: The DVT incidence among psychiatric inpatients was 1.6%. Predictive model performance, measured by the area under the curve (AUC), showed logistic regression (0.900), random forest (0.885), SVM (0.890), and XGBoost (0.889) performed well. Logistic regression and random forest models exhibited optimal overall performance, while XGBoost excelled in recall. Significant predictors of DVT included elevated D-dimer levels, age, Alzheimer's disease, and Madopar use.
CONCLUSION: Psychiatric inpatients require vigilance for DVT risk, with factors like D-dimer levels and age serving as critical indicators. Machine learning models effectively predict DVT risk, enabling early detection and personalized prevention strategies in clinical practice.",Clin Epidemiol
40059063,Linking Circadian Rhythms to Gut-Brain Axis Lipid Metabolism Associated With Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a decline in cognitive, learning, and memory abilities. Neuroinflammation is associated with the spread of tau tangles in the neocortex of AD, leading to cognitive impairment. Therefore, clarifying the pathogenesis of Neuroinflammation and finding effective treatments are the crucial issues for the clinical management of AD.
METHOD: We systematically review the latest research on the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies of AD in PubMed, Web of Science, and Elsevier SD.
RESULT: In this review, the mechanism of the effect of gut-brain axis lipid metabolism mediated by circadian rhythm on AD was discussed, and we also analysed the effects of inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) induced by lipid abnormalities on intestinal mucosal barrier and neurodegeneration; furthermore, the importance of lipid homeostasis (phospholipids, fatty acids, sterol) in maintaining the functions of endoplasmic reticulum was emphasized. Meanwhile, as lipid composition affects protein conformation, the membrane phospholipids surrounding sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) that influence SERCA to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediating inflammation were also reviewed.
CONCLUSION: We interpreted the mechanism of action between lipid microdomains and ER membrane proteins, reviewed the role of the new pathway of circadian rhythm, lipid metabolism, intestinal mucosa, and brain signaling in the pathogenesis of AD, and proposed strategies to prevent AD by changing the dietary lipid measures.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40142784,Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists: Exciting Avenues Beyond Weight Loss.,"The last two decades have proffered many remarkable choices in managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Leading the list are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs), the first of which, exenatide, was approved by the FDA in 2005. Two other major classes of drugs have also entered the market: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, commonly known as gliptins and approved in 2006, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, with the first approval occurring in 2013. These drugs have revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. Additionally, on the horizon, the once-weekly basal insulin analog insulin icodec and the once-weekly combination of insulin icodec and semaglutide are expected to be available in the future. Beyond glycemic control, GLP1RAs have exhibited benefits in conditions associated with diabetes, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, emerging research suggests potential roles in certain types of cancer, infertility, and associative learning. Major cardiovascular events seem to be lower in patients on GLP1RAs. While some evidence is robust, other findings remain tenuous. It is important that clinicians are familiar with current research in order to provide optimal evidence-based care to patients. In the not-too-distant future, there may be a case to prescribe these drugs for benefits outside diabetes.",J Clin Med
40002740,Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Mechanisms and Corresponding Therapeutic Strategies.,"Neurodegenerative disease (ND) refers to the progressive loss and morphological abnormalities of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent studies have shown that mitochondria play a broad role in cell signaling, immune response, and metabolic regulation. For example, mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with the onset and progression of a variety of diseases, including ND, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The dysfunction of energy metabolism, imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics, or abnormal mitophagy can lead to the imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis, which can induce pathological reactions such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, damage the nervous system, and participate in the occurrence and development of degenerative nervous system diseases such as AD, PD, and ALS. In this paper, the latest research progress of this subject is detailed. The mechanisms of oxidative stress, mitochondrial homeostasis, and mitophagy-mediated ND are reviewed from the perspectives of β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, dopamine neuron damage, and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutation. Based on the mechanism research, new ideas and methods for the treatment and prevention of ND are proposed.",Biomedicines
40017019,Social Support and Sleep Quality Among Bereaved AD/ADRD Caregivers: A Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Nearly 7 million adults aged 65 and above in the United States live with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD), and it is the fifth most common cause of death. Bereaved AD/ADRD informal caregivers report high rates of sleep disturbances that may impair daily functioning. Social support is a potentially modifiable resource fostering sleep quality; however, little is known regarding the contributing role of social support to sleep quality among bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: This study explored the contributing role of social support to sleep quality among bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers posting to an online forum.
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design addressed the research objective. We collated 1771 forum threads comprising 2 012 195 words posted by bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers on the ALZConnected forum (2011-2023). Posts related to sleep were extracted using the keywords ""bed,"" ""dream,"" ""nap,"" ""sleep,"" ""slept,"" ""wake,"" and ""woke.""
RESULTS: A total of 178 threads contained information relevant to the contribution of social support to sleep quality in bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers. Using qualitative content analysis, we identified 3 themes: Restorative Function (Safe/Secure), Relational Identity Function (Belonging/Connection), and Comforting Presence Function (Warmth/Comfort).
CONCLUSION: Findings further the understanding of the social context in which sleep quality in bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers is experienced. Findings from this study may inform clinical practice and research efforts aimed at enhancing sleep quality through social support in bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers.",West J Nurs Res
40146360,The effect of rosacea on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"This study aimed to explore the potential causal relationships between rosacea and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety disorders, and depression with MR analysis. Genetic data for rosacea and the four neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders were sourced from GWAS databases. After completing stringent quality control procedures, SNPs meeting significance thresholds were selected as IVs. Our primary statistical analysis was conducted by IVW approach. To investigate the robustness of results, heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analyses, and pleiotropy assessments were conducted. Reverse MR analyses were subsequently carried out to further substantiate the causal relationships. The present study discovered a positive correlation between rosacea and an elevated risk of depression (OR = 1.0015, 95% CI = 1.0002-1.0027, P = 0.02). There is no causal evidence to support a connection between rosacea and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or anxiety disorders. Reverse MR analyses indicated no causal associations between these four disorders and the risk of rosacea. The findings reveal that individuals with rosacea may have an elevated risk of depression.",Arch Dermatol Res
39984543,Association of genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive function in two European populations.,"Although there is some evidence of an association between Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk score (AD PRS) and cognitive function, limited validations have been performed in large populations. We investigated the relationship between AD PRS and cognitive function in the UK Biobank in over 276,000 participants and further validated the association in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sample. We developed the AD PRS (excluded the APOE variants) in the middle age UK Biobank participants (age ranged 39-72, mean age 57 years) of European ancestries by LDpred2. To validate the association of AD PRS and cognitive function internally in the UK Biobank, we linearly regressed standardized cognitive function on continuous standardized AD PRS with age at cognitive test, sex, genotyping array, first 10 principal components of genotyping, smoking, education in years, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E gene ε4 (APOE4) risk allele dosages. To validate the associations externally, we ran the linear mixed effects model in the ADNI sample free of dementia (age ranged 55-91, mean age 73), including similar covariates as fixed effects and participants' IDs as the random effect. Stratification by age, APOE4 carrier status, and cognitive status (cognitively normal or mild cognitive impairment) was also investigated. Our study validated the associations of AD PRS and cognitive function in both midlife and late-life observational cohorts. Although not all of the cognitive measures were significantly associated with AD PRS, non-verbal fluid reasoning (matrix pattern completion, β = - 0.022, P = 0.003), processing speed (such as symbol digit substitution, β = - 0.017, P = 1.08E-05), short-term memory and attention (such as pairs matching, β = - 0.014, P = 1.66E-10), and reaction time (β = - 0.010, P = 1.19E-06) were inversely associated with increasing AD PRS in the UK Biobank. Higher likelihood of cognitive impairment was also associated with higher AD PRS in the ADNI cognitive normal individuals (AD assessment scale β = 0.079, P = 0.02). In summary, we confirmed that poorer cognitive function was associated with a higher polygenic AD risk, and suggested the potential utility of the AD PRS in identifying those who may be at risk for further cognitive decline.",Sci Rep
39983328,Blood N-glycomics reveals individuals at risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Blood biomarkers with prognostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are crucial for selecting at-risk individuals for interventions. Altered protein N-glycosylation has been implicated in several pathogenic pathways in AD and could be an early AD biomarker.
METHODS: We developed a mass spectrometry-based method to simultaneously quantify 62 blood N-glycan structures in individuals with biological or clinical AD and matched controls. We analysed N-glycan levels in a Swedish discovery cohort (n = 40) and validated our results in a Norwegian cohort (n = 60). Individuals were grouped according to N-glycan levels using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Difference in disease progression between groups were modelled using linear mixed-effects models.
FINDINGS: A subgroup of individuals exhibited low blood N-glycosylation (32.4% of Swedish cohort, 37.9% of Norwegian cohort). In the Swedish cohort, low N-glycosylation was associated with AD and cognitive decline. In the Norwegian cohort, low blood N-glycosylation showed no correlation with amyloid/tau, but importantly, strongly predicted future cognitive decline. In total, fourteen N-glycan structures were significantly less abundant in the low N-glycosylation group compared to the rest of the individuals in both cohorts.
INTERPRETATION: Reduced blood N-glycan levels predict cognitive decline independent of amyloid or tau status. Blood N-glycome profiling could be used to identify individuals at risk for AD dementia.

40131695,Treadmill Exercise Modulates the Leptin/LepR/GSK-3β Signalling Pathway to Improve Leptin Sensitivity and Alleviate Neuroinflammation in High-Fat Diet-Fed APP/PS1 Mice.,"Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is closely associated with obesity. In AD, the fat cell-secreted protein leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier and protects against nerve damage. However, obesity may induce leptin resistance, reduce leptin sensitivity, stimulate excessive glial cell activation, promote inflammatory factor production and exacerbate brain inflammation. Unfortunately, the mechanism of interaction among high-fat diets, obesity, neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. We investigated the changes in neuroinflammation and leptin sensitivity in the brains of wild-type and high-fat-diet-fed APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We explored the effects of treadmill exercise for 12 weeks on the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway and memory. The body weights of the high-fat-diet-fed mice increased, and elevated levels of markers for leptin resistance, including suppressor of signalling 3 (SOCS3), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and proinflammatory factors such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were observed. After 12 weeks of aerobic exercise, the leptin mRNA and protein levels increased, GSK-3β protein expression decreased and the mean fluorescence intensities of brain microglial (IBA-1) and neuron markers (NeuN) decreased, indicating that exercise may activate the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway, reducing glial cell activation and inflammation. Our study revealed that obesity induces and exacerbates the AD-related neuroinflammatory response. Aerobic exercise activates the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β pathway to relieve neuroinflammation and protect nerve cells, alleviating AD-associated memory loss. These promising outcomes could inform the development of nondrug-based aerobic exercise interventions for the treatment of AD and associated cognitive disorders.",Mol Neurobiol
40151911,Effect of ventricular volume on cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"BackgroundIdiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a common disorder in aging populations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant comorbidity in iNPH patients, and the presence of AD pathology is associated with worse shunting outcomes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of AD-associated biomarkers in iNPH patients are universally reduced and the exact mechanism related to this is unknown.ObjectiveOur aim was to study the effects of ventricular volume on CSF AD-associated biomarker levels in iNPH patients, to determine whether a dilution effect occurs and to assess if brain AD pathology contributes to this effect.MethodsA total of 153 iNPH patients had lumbar CSF samples available for analysis, along with brain MRIs of sufficient quality. Automated image analysis software was used to determine the volume of different brain segments. Volumes normalized for age, sex and head size were used for analysis. Brain biopsy data on AD pathology was also available.ResultsNone of the intracerebral ventricular volumes correlated with CSF levels of AD-associated biomarkers, indicating no dilution effect was present in this context. However, in iNPH patients positive for amyloid-β pathology in the biopsy, the volume of the fourth ventricle correlated inversely with all investigated biomarkers.ConclusionsIntracerebral ventricular volumes do not correlate with AD biomarker levels in CSF, arguing against a dilution effect. However, in patients with AD pathology, the volume of the fourth ventricle is inversely correlated with CSF T-Tau and P-Tau<sub>181</sub> levels, suggesting a complex relationship between brain AD pathology, CSF flow and CSF volume in iNPH patients.",J Alzheimers Dis
40032030,Astragalin actives autophagy and inhibits apoptosis of astrocytes in AD mice via down-regulating Fas/Fasl-VDAC1 pathway.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a common neurodegenerative disease, which characterized by amyloid Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Astragalin (AST), a natural flavonoid, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, and other pharmacological effects. Astrocytes can phagocytize and degrade Aβ in their vicinity. In this study, we used the AD mice model established by injecting the mixture of Aβ1-42 and Aβ25-35 into the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and C8D1A cells injured by Aβ1-42 to explore the neuroprotective effects of AST. Our findings showed that AST enhances learning and cognitive ability of AD mice, reduces Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, and improves the structural morphology of hippocampal nerve cells. Furthermore, AST promoted autophagy and suppressed apoptosis of astrocytes in the AD model. Additionally, AST inhibited the expression of proteins associated with the Fas/Fasl-VDAC1 signaling pathway, while autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or apoptosis agonist phenoxodiol reversed above change. Interestingly, consistent with the action of pathway Fas inhibitor KR-33493, AST could activate autophagy of Aβ1-42 injured C8D1A cells while inhibit their apoptosis.

40166757,"Relationship Between Peripheral Serum Adiponectin and Cerebrospinal Fluid TNF-α, IL-1β, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid and Perioperative Neurocognitive Dysfunction in Elderly Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroplasty.","BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND) represents a form of cognitive impairment related to surgery and anesthesia, which may manifest hours or even weeks after the surgical procedure, persist, and potentially progress into Alzheimer's disease. The etiology of PND is intricate, with central nervous inflammation playing a crucial role. The clinical manifestations of PND are not distinctive, no obvious image alterations are observable, and the diagnosis rate is relatively low, thereby influencing prognosis and augmenting postoperative complications and mortality. The optimal treatment approach for PND lies in timely identification and management of the high-risk factors causing PND and implementing early prevention. We hypothesize that the level of peripheral blood adiponectin (APN) is correlated with PND, potentially through inhibiting the central inflammatory response and regulating brain energy metabolism.
METHODS: Fifty elderly patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty under continuous epidural spinal anesthesia (CESA) were included. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days. Serum APN and CSF levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, lactic acid, and pyruvic acid were measured. The occurrence of PND was recorded, and the patients were divided into a PND group and a non-PND group.
RESULTS: PND occurred in 16 patients (34.04%). The PND group had lower serum APN levels and higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and lactic acid compared to the non-PND group. CSF TNF-α and IL-1β levels were negatively correlated with serum APN concentration. These biomarkers are associated with PND occurrence and have high diagnostic value.
CONCLUSION: Decreases in serum APN and increases in TNF-α, IL-1β, and lactic acid in CSF may be involved in the pathophysiological process of PND in elderly patients after surgery.",Clin Interv Aging
40034358,The effect of probiotics on select cognitive domains in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, and probiotics may offer therapeutic benefits by modulating gut microbiota and reducing inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: This study systematically evaluated the impact of probiotics on cognitive function in MCI and AD through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs (January 2000-January 2024) on probiotic interventions lasting 8-24 weeks. Cognitive outcomes included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), language, naming, visual-spatial, memory, and attention. Data were analyzed using R with a random-effects model to calculate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was rigorously assessed.
RESULTS: Out of 2000 articles, 500 full texts were screened, and 10 studies were included. The meta-analysis showed varied effect sizes: MMSE (SMD: 0.28, 95%CI -0.35-0.91, p = 0.38), MoCA (SMD: 0.51, 95%CI -0.49-1.52, p = 0.33), language (SMD: -0.12, 95% CI -0.54-0.29, p = 0.56), naming (SMD: 0.02, 95%CI -0.69-0.74, p = 0.95), visual-spatial (SMD: 0.38, 95%CI -0.13-0.88, p = 0.14), memory (SMD: 0.20, 95%CI -0.15-0.55, p = 0.26), and attention (SMD: -0.07, 95%CI -0.44-0.30, p = 0.71). Positive SMDs suggest cognitive improvement, while non-significant negative SMDs indicate trends toward decline, inclined by probiotic strains, duration, and participant characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics did not significantly improve cognitive function in MCI and AD patients, with variability in effects across cognitive domains, suggesting the need for tailored interventions and future studies.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40084663,"Associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms and pathology in clinicopathologically defined Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies, and dementia with Lewy bodies.","BackgroundNeuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, but a higher NPS burden is found in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy body (LB) pathology frequently co-occurs with AD pathology and may not meet neuropathological criteria for DLB (ADLB). NPS trajectories over disease course in these subgroups is not well understood.ObjectiveWe investigated changes in NPS severity over time, at two time points, comparing clinicopathologically defined cohorts of AD (without LB), ADLB, DLB, and controls.MethodsCases with two available Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPIQ), at the time of enrollment and within 2.5 years of death, were selected from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Differences and rate of change in NPIQ scores were compared between AD (n = 75), ADLB (n = 48) DLB (n = 65), and controls (n = 32) with covariates for age, sex, and cognition.ResultsFirst NPIQ scores were highest in ADLB when compared to AD (p = 0.04) and controls (p = 0.01) but not different from DLB. A significant increase in NPS severity was observed in DLB and AD (p &lt; 0.001) over a mean follow up time of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, and the rate of change was significantly greater in DLB when compared to other groups. Final NPIQ scores were highest in DLB when compared to AD (p = 0.03) but not ADLB, and in DLB, ADLB, and AD than controls (all p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsEarly NPS burden as well as NPS severity progression rate, independently of cognitive status, might be useful clinical metrics and may help predict underlying pathological diagnoses.",J Alzheimers Dis

40143384,Estrogen G-Protein Coupled Receptor Antagonist G15 Promotes Tau Clearance in 2D and 3D Tauopathy Models.,"Several studies have investigated the efficacy of estrogen in age-related diseases, showing promising results in several models of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease. Animal and cellular models indicate that estrogen and related compounds can reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau protein, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is crucial to develop appropriate models to study the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, and three-dimensional (3D) models have recently emerged as a viable alternative to animal testing. This study aimed to investigate the potential of 3D tauopathy models for drug testing, focusing on estrogen-related signaling. The results demonstrate that a scaffold-free neurospheroid with inducible tau protein expression allows for the observation of tau protein distribution throughout the spheroid. Moreover, the study found that the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor antagonist, G15, reduced tau protein concentration in both 2D and 3D models. Thus, this study highlights the importance of estrogen-related compounds in 3D cultures, which could facilitate investigations into the mechanisms of action and the neuroprotective role of estrogen in neurodegenerative diseases.",Cell Biochem Funct
40039745,Alzheimer's Disease Classification From Speech Pause Distributions With Context Information.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to affect the lengths and frequencies of certain kinds of pauses in speech. Previous studies have used features based on pause lengths for AD classification. We conjecture that in addition to using pause lengths, it is beneficial to incorporate the ""context"" behind each pause, i.e., what is being said before and after each pause. We propose an AD detection method based on this idea. As part of the proposed method, pause lengths and context are extracted from the raw audio using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and forced alignment. Then, statistical summaries of pause lengths with context information are extracted from the transcripts and used as features for classification. Our results indicate that incorporating the context significantly improves classification performance compared to using pause lengths alone, with classification accuracy of up to 81%. Additionally, the proposed features largely preserve privacy.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40054827,The anti-Alzheimer's disease effects of ganoderic acid A by inhibiting ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation via activation of the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive and memory abilities, social disorders, and behavioral abnormalities. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent type of programmed cell death, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of iron within cells, leading to increased oxidative stress, and ultimately lipid peroxidation and cell death. Ganoderic acid A (GAA), one of the major pharmacologically active components in Ganoderma lucidum, exhibits an excellent neuroprotective effect against AD. However, it is unclear whether GAA improves the symptoms of AD by inhibiting ferroptosis. This study investigated the anti-AD effects of GAA through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, and determined its molecular mechanism from the perspective of ferroptosis modulation. The results showed that GAA administration attenuated hippocampal neuronal loss, improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, and enhanced the memory and learning ability of the AD mice. In vitro assays suggested that GAA effectively protected HT22 AD cells against ferroptosis-related morphological damage, enhanced their antioxidant capacity, maintained their iron metabolism, and reduced mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the immunofluorescence and western blotting results showed that the levels of NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2 (NRF2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) both in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and amyloid beta (Aβ)<sub>25-35</sub>-induced HT22 AD cells were markedly enhanced after GAA administration. In summary, these results revealed that GAA improves AD by activating on the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to inhibit ferroptosis-lipid peroxidation.",Chem Biol Interact

40015348,Treadmill exercise ameliorates hippocampal synaptic injury and recognition memory deficits by TREM2 in AD rat model.,"OBJECTIVE: The impairment of cognitive function has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exercise exerts a positive modulatory effect on cognition by reducing synapse injury. However, limited in vivo evidence is available to validate the neuroprotective effect of TREM2 on synaptic function in this phenomenon. Here, we aim to explore whether physical exercise pretreatment alters Aβ-induced recognition memory impairment in structural synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus in AD rats. METHODS：: In study 1, fifty-two Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into following four groups: control group (C group, n = 13), Alzheimer's disease group (AD group, n = 13), 4 weeks of physical exercise and Alzheimer's disease group (Exe+AD group, n = 13), 4 weeks of physical exercise and blank group (Exercise group, n = 13). Four weeks of treadmill exercise intervention was performed, and AD model were established by intra-cerebroventricular injection (ICV) injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> protein. After 3 weeks, we also conducted a novel object test to evaluate recognition memory in the behavior assessment. Golgi staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the morphology and synaptic ultrastructure of neurons. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of hippocampal synaptic proteins. Extracellular neurotransmitters in the hippocampus were detected by microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. In study 2, 33 SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: 4 weeks of physical exercise and Alzheimer's disease group (Exe+AD group, n = 11), AAV-Control and physical exercise and Alzheimer's disease group (AAV-Control+Exe+AD group, n = 11), AAV-TREM2 and physical exercise and Alzheimer's disease group (AAV-TREM2 +Exe+AD group, n = 11). Stereotactic intracerebral injection in the bilateral hippocampus was performed to achieve microglial TREM2 down-expression by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) with CD68 promoter. After 4 weeks treadmill exercise and 3 weeks Aβ injection, all rats received behavior test and molecular experiment, which the same with experiment 2.
RESULTS: Novel recognition index in novel object recognition test significantly decreased, and western blot demonstrate that hippocampal TREM2 protein is significantly decreased (P < 0.001). But physical exercise reversed this phenomenon(P < 0.001). In addition, compared with Con group, the neuron from Exe+AD group exhibited a more complex branching pattern (P < 0.05). And impaired synaptic ultrastructure was observed in AD group. Hippocampal synaptic-related protein (SYX, SYP, GAP43, PSD95) and neurotransmitter (DA, Glu, GABA) was also significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in AD group. But the neuroprotection effect can be found in Exe+AD group, which are associated with the inhibition of synaptic injury by activate hippocampal TREM2 (P < 0.05). However, when blockade of hippocampal TREM2 reduced brain protective effect of exercise in AD rat model, including increased the damage of neuronal dendritic complexity, synaptic ultrastructure, and the decrease of hippocampal synapses-related protein, typical neurotransmitter.
CONCLUSION: Treadmill exercise facilitated recognition memory acquisition via TREM2-mediated structural synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus in an AD rat model.",Brain Res Bull
40074652,Multi-omics analysis of druggable genes to facilitate Alzheimer's disease therapy: A multi-cohort machine learning study.,"BACKGROUND: The swift rise in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) alongside its significant societal and economic impact has created a pressing demand for effective interventions and treatments. However, there are no available treatments that can modify the progression of the disease.
METHODS: Eight AD brain tissues datasets and three blood datasets were obtained. Consensus clustering was utilized as a method to discern the various subtypes of AD. Then, module genes were screened using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, screening hub genes was conducted through machine-learning analyses. Finally, A comprehensive analysis using a systematic approach to druggable genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted.
RESULTS: Two AD subclasses were identified, namely cluster.A and cluster.B. The levels of gamma secretase activity, beta secretase activity, and amyloid-beta 42 were found to be significantly elevated in patients classified within cluster A when compared to those in cluster B. Furthermore, by utilizing the differentially expressed genes shared among these clusters, along with identifying druggable genes and applying WGCNA to these subtypes, we were able to develop a scoring system referred to as DG.score. This scoring system has demonstrated remarkable predictive capability for AD when evaluated against multiple datasets. Besides, A total of 30 distinct genes that may serve as potential drug targets for AD were identified across at least one of the datasets investigated, whether derived from brain samples or blood analyses. Among the identified genes, three specific candidates that are considered druggable (LIMK2, MAPK8, and NDUFV2) demonstrated significant expression levels in both blood and brain tissues. Furthermore, our research also revealed a potential association between the levels of LIMK2 and concentrations of CSF Aβ (OR 1.526 (1.155-2.018)), CSF p-tau (OR 1.106 (1.024-01.196)), and hippocampal size (OR 0.831 (0.702-0.948)).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a notable advancement to the existing literature by offering genetic evidence that underscores the potential therapeutic advantages of focusing on the druggable gene LIMK2 in the treatment of AD. This insight not only contributes to our understanding of AD but also guides future drug discovery efforts.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40095666,The neuropathologic basis for translational biomarker development in the macaque model of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAccurate placement of the macaque within the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research framework is essential to discover early-stage predictive biomarkers.ObjectiveTo assess utility of the aging macaque in advancing translational biomarker development for preclinical AD, we evaluated relative signal strength of comparable neuropathologic phenomena in macaques and patients.MethodsWe compared pathology in patient and macaque formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues using identical criteria. We quantified expression of amyloid-β (Aβ), pTau, and inflammatory and senescence markers across species. Distribution of AD-relevant markers were compared in FFPE and perfused frozen macaque brain to assess expression of labile proteins that could inform in-life fluid biomarkers.ResultsAβ pathology in macaques closely approximated patient pathology. Complex plaque composition in macaques implied significant disruption of synaptic connectivity. In FFPE tissue, pretangle pTau immunoreactivity placed the macaque in Braak Stage 1b. In perfused frozen tissue, soluble pTau distribution approximated Braak Stage III-IV. In macaque, Aβ, pTau, and acetylcholinesterase labeling co-localized to AD-vulnerable circuits. Significant association of glial fibrillary acidic protein with Aβ occurred in humans only. The senescence marker p16 correlated positively with pTau expression and negatively with Aβ in patients only. Macaques lacked neuropathologic co-morbidities.ConclusionsAD-relevant neuropathologic signals in the macaque support biomarker discovery in the areas of Aβ plaque evolution and associated synaptic disruption as well as early-stage tau phosphorylation. Relative protection from accumulation of senescence markers, fibrillar tau and neuropathologic co-morbidities in macaque implicate species difference in rates of biological brain aging.

The current study developed new hybrid compounds by merging phenyl piperazines, and 2,4-thiazolidinedione moieties based on their reported MAO inhibitory activities. The newly synthesized derivatives were screened for their MAOs inhibitory activity using in-vitro fluorometric assay. Most newly synthesized compounds elicited strong inhibitory activity against both hMAO isozymes. Hybrids 4a and 4c were the most potent hMAO-A inhibitors with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.194 and 0.188 µM, respectively, compared to toloxatone as reference (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.080 µM), meanwhile, compound 4g exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against MAO-B with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.330 µM. The kinetic study of compound 4c revealed that it exhibited a mixed inhibition mode with a K<sub>i</sub> value of 3.4 nM. Compound 4c was evaluated against the normal SH-SY5Y cell line and found to be non-cytotoxic at its active inhibition concentration. ADME profiles of the most active hybrids 4a, 4c, 4j, and 4k revealed that they could serve as successful drug candidates showing good CNS penetration. Molecular docking simulations were executed for the most active motifs 4a and 4c to demonstrate the binding pattern with the target proteins explaining their potential inhibitory activity.

40131356,Porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles divert host innate immunity and promote inflammation via C4' monophosphorylated lipid A.,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is a prevalent pathogen that promotes human periodontal disease (PD) and exacerbates systemic comorbidities such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. Pg produces nonphosphorylated tetra-acylated lipid A (NPLA) in its outer membrane (OM) that evades host Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), inflammasome pathways, and cationic peptides, enhancing bacterial survival. Here, we show that Pg also releases outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that engage and divert host cell TLR4, inflammasome, and LL-37 responses away from the microbe. We determined that Pg OMVs are enriched for C4' monophosphoryl lipid A (C4'-MPLA), an established agonist for TLR4-TRIF-IFNβ and inflammasome-IL-1β responses. Comparisons of Pg 381 and Pg 33277 stationary phase cultures revealed higher OMV production by Pg 381, which correlates with its higher proinflammatory pathogenicity. The cationic peptide, polymyxin B (PMB), which selectively binds lipid A C4'-phosphate, reduces OMV-stimulated HEK cell TLR4 activation and THP-1 cell IL-1β production, confirming the proinflammatory role for OMV-C4'-MPLA. Similar to PMB, the host defense peptide, LL-37, inhibits OMV-C4'-MPLA-dependent HEK cell TLR4 activation. PMB and LL-37 also blocked OMV-C4'-MPLA-driven TLR4 activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Finally, wild-type Pg-containing OM-NPLA is highly resistant to LL-37 antimicrobial activity, whereas the ΔlpxF mutant bacterium, retaining OM-C4'-MPLA, is killed by the peptide. In summary, Pg escapes host TLR4 signaling, inflammasome activation, and LL-37 interaction by retaining immunoevasive OM-NPLA. Moreover, Pg dispenses proinflammatory OMV-C4'-MPLA, which engages and redirects those host defenses. We suggest that OMV-C4'-MPLA triggers elevated IFNβ and IL-1β cytokines, which typify PD comorbidities, and drive PD-related alveolar bone loss.",J Immunol

Currently, BGHM and BIA are both widely acknowledged as biomarkers that aid in diagnosing CNS disorders, distinguishing between disorders with similar symptoms, and tracking disease progression. Therapeutics targeting BGHM and BIA in Alzheimer's disease can be beneficial in treating neurocognitive symptoms. This review addresses the evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting BGHM and BIA in multiple CNS disorders. Intranasal insulin, which is anti-inflammatory and increases brain cell energy, and intranasal deferoxamine, which reduces oxidative damage and inflammation, represent promising treatments targeting these mechanisms.

40002537,The Endothelial Cell-Related Genes EIF1 and HSPA1B Contribute to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease by Modulating Peripheral Immunoinflammatory Responses.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immunoinflammatory responses contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and endothelial cells (ECs) are involved in these responses. Nevertheless, the potential molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which ECs modulate peripheral immunoinflammatory responses and thus contribute to AD pathogenesis are not fully understood.
METHODS: The single-cell RNA sequencing dataset GSE157827 was analyzed, and AD key genes were screened using LASSO regression and random forest algorithms. Functional enrichment analyses of these AD key genes were conducted using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis. Immune cell infiltration analyses for AD key genes were performed using single-sample GSEA, and their correlations with immunoinflammatory factors were assessed using the TISIDB database. Peripheral blood RNA sequencing data from our cohort were utilized to validate the expression patterns of EC-related AD key genes in peripheral blood and to investigate their association with cognition.
RESULTS: ECs are the most significant contributors to AD among all brain cell subpopulations. For the first time, the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B were identified as key genes associated with AD progression. These two EC-related key genes may participate in AD pathogenesis by modulating peripheral immunoinflammatory responses. The levels of EIF1 and HSPA1B were significantly altered in the peripheral blood during AD progression, and EIF1 levels correlated with cognitive functions in AD clinical continuum patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the critical roles of the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B in AD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for this disease.",Brain Sci
40005250,"Discovery of Isobavachin, a Natural Flavonoid, as an Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) Structure Corrector for Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by extensive neurodegeneration and consequent severe memory loss. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, with its pathological effects linked to structural instability and altered interactions with lipids and other important disease proteins including amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau (τ). Therefore, correcting and stabilizing the ApoE4 structure has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating its detrimental effects. In this study, we investigated naturally occurring bioavailable flavonoids as ApoE4 stabilizers, focusing on their potential to modulate ApoE4 structure and function. A comprehensive investigation of a focused database using our integrated computational and experimental screening protocol led to the identification of Isobavachin as a potential corrector and stabilizer of ApoE4 structure. In addition, a few other bioavailable flavonoids with similar stabilizing properties were identified, albeit to a much lesser extent as compared to Isobavachin. The findings support the therapeutic potential of flavonoids as ApoE4 modulators and highlight Isobavachin as a lead candidate for further preclinical evaluation. These results provide new insights into the pharmacological targeting of ApoE4 and open avenues for the development of flavonoid-based, ApoE-directed therapies for AD.",Molecules
40050715,Annual societal cost of Alzheimer's disease in Malaysia: a micro-costing approach.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to have a significant impact on resource use and economic consequences along with population aging. This study aims to investigate the annual economic burden of Alzheimer's disease along with underlying cost drivers.
METHODOLOGY: Patients with AD aged 65 and above accompanied with primary caregivers were recruited in 6 tertiary care hospitals. A structured interview was conducted to collect sociodemographic, clinical and resource use information using an adapted questionnaire. Direct medical cost, direct non-medical cost and indirect cost were annualised and categorised by severity level. Generalised linear models were applied to investigate predictors of costs.
RESULTS: Among 135 patient-caregiver dyads, the annual economic burden of AD from a societal perspective was USD 8618.83 ± USD 6740.79 per capita. The societal cost of severe AD patients (USD11943.19 ± USD6954.17) almost doubled those in mild AD (USD6281.10 ± USD6879.83). IDC was the primary cost driver (77.7%) which represented the impact of productivity loss due to informal care. Besides disease severity, time spent in informal care, caregivers' employment and use of special accommodation were predictors of AD cost. This neurodegenerative disorder is estimated to impose a burden of USD1.9 billion in 2022, which represents 0.47% of Malaysia's GDP.
CONCLUSION: This study provided real-world empirical cost estimates of AD burden in Malaysia. Informal care is a significant contributor to the societal cost of AD. Optimal healthcare resource allocation is essential in the decision making of healthcare stakeholders to address rising demands.",BMC Geriatr

This paper aimed to (i) identify environmental toxins associated with AD, PD, and ALS, (ii) locate potential industrial sources of toxins in the United States (U.S.), and (iii) assess epigenetic changes driven by exposure to toxins reported by patients. Environmental factors and epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compiled from 69 studies in the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and geographic information system approaches. Some 127 environmental toxins have been associated or putatively associated with AD, PD, or ALS, with four toxic metals (As, Cd, Mn, and Hg) common to all three of these neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental toxins associated with epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) in patients include air pollutants, metals, and organic chemicals (e.g., pesticides, mycotoxins, and cyanotoxins). Geographic analysis showed that study locations (e.g., U.S., Europe, and East Asia) were selected by researchers based on convenience of access rather than exposure risk and disease prevalence. We conclude that several toxins and epigenetic markers shared among neurodegenerative diseases could serve as attractive future targets guiding environmental quality improvements and aiding in early disease detection.",Toxics
40034351,Critical evaluation of COSMIN scores in scales for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: A comprehensive review.,"Background: Timely diagnosis and intervention of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can delay the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze assessment tools for cognitive function using the Consensus Criteria for Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) method. Comparing the validity, reliability, and practicality of these assessment tools helps clinicians select appropriate assessment tools for patients, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Methods:We followed the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and used the COSMIN checklist to conduct a thorough methodological quality assessment of the studies. The measurement properties were evaluated and rated on a scale from excellent to poor, based on adapted criteria. We then synthesized the best evidence by combining the COSMIN outcomes with the quality of findings to ensure a precise and comprehensive analysis. Results: We identified a total of 156 publications, which included 19 different cognitive assessment instruments. Among these, the Telephone version of the Cantonese Mini-Mental State Examination (T-CMMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Hong Kong versions of the MoCA (HK-MoCA-A1 and A2) demonstrated distinguished qualities. The assessment of measurement properties included internal consistency, reliability, validity, and sensitivity and specificity. Notably, the T-CMMSE showed superior methodological quality based on our rigorous analysis. Conclusions: The T-CMMSE, MoCA, and HK-MoCA-A1 and A2 were found to be notable cognitive assessment tools for MCI and AD. Future research should aim to expand on these findings by exploring a wider range of tools and contexts.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40108056,Identification of Key Fatty Acid Metabolism-Related Genes in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and the role of fatty acid metabolism in its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Using AD transcriptome sequencing data from the GEO database, we initially screened for differentially expressed genes and applied Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify crucial gene modules. By intersecting these genes with fatty acid metabolism-related genes (FAMRGs), we obtained AD-related fatty acid metabolism genes (AD-FAMRGs). Subsequently, we conducted KEGG, GO, and Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA). Furthermore, we employed three machine learning algorithms to determine the key AD-FAMRGs. Risk genes were thus identified, leading to the construction of a risk model which was subsequently validated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Additionally, protein docking studies were performed to assess interactions between key AD-FAMRGs and Tau as well as amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins. To explore potential therapeutic avenues, we searched the DrugBank database for agents targeting these AD-FAMRGs, followed by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Our investigations highlighted three key AD-FAMRGs: DLD, ELOVL5, and HMGCS1. Functional enrichment analysis indicated their association with metabolism, oxidative stress, and AD pathogenesis. ZDOCK analysis further suggested their interactions with Tau and Aβ proteins, pointing to their possible involvement in AD's pathological processes. ROC analysis demonstrated the predictive accuracy of these AD-FAMRGs, with AUC values ranging from 0.764 to 0.876. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations confirmed the favorable binding of predicted therapeutic agents to these key AD-FAMRGs. Our findings suggest that fatty acid metabolism may be involved in AD pathogenesis, and DLD, ELOVL5, and HMGCS1 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for AD.",Mol Neurobiol
40045558,Cardiovascular diseases and risk of dementia in the general population.,"AIMS: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been linked to increased risk of dementia in observational studies, whereas genetic studies have yielded inconsistent findings. We aimed to determine whether nine CVDs are causally associated with the risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia.
METHODS: We performed time-dependent Cox regression analyses in three prospective cohorts, the Copenhagen City Heart Study (N=10,373), the Copenhagen General Population Study (N=101,582), and the UK Biobank (N=377,706), and meta-analyzed individual estimates. Furthermore, we assessed genetic susceptibility for CVDs and the risk of dementia using individual-level data from the UK Biobank and summary statistics from the FinnGen study.
RESULTS: Observationally, CVDs were associated with risk of all incident outcomes in meta-analyses, with hazard ratios up to 7.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.20, 7.92). Genetically, in the UK Biobank, susceptibility for ischemic stroke was associated with risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia, and odds ratios (ORs) were 1.64 (1.35, 1.98), 1.44 (1.10, 1.89), and 2.06 (1.41, 3.01), respectively, with similar estimates for ischemic stroke; genetic susceptibility for ischemic heart disease was associated with risk of vascular dementia (OR: 1.24 [1.03, 1.50]). Genetic summary statistics from the FinnGen study confirmed the associations between ischemic stroke and stroke.
CONCLUSION: Associations between stroke and all-cause dementia and its major subtypes are likely to be causal. Moreover, genetic susceptibility for ischemic heart disease is associated with incident vascular dementia. These findings underscore the importance of integrating CVD prevention into interventions to enable early prevention and reduce the risk of dementia.",Eur J Prev Cardiol

40033867,Exploring the Mechanism of Kai-Xin-San to Improve Cognitive Deficits in AD Rats Induced by D-Gal and Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> Based on Multi-Omics and Network Analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease for which there are no effective drugs. Kai-Xin-San (KXS), with definite curative effects, is widely used for the prevention and treatment of AD in China. But its mechanism is not yet fully understood. Based on our established rat model and previous pharmacodynamics study, Multi-omics (metabolomics, proteomics) and network analysis were integrated to explore the holistic mechanism of anti-AD effects of KXS. The key pathways were validated with western blot and ELISA methods. Morris water maze and Nissl staining showed that KXS could ameliorate cognitive deficits and pathological morphology of the hippocampus in AD rats. A total of nine metabolites were identified, which were related to pyrimidine metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Proteomics results indicated that the improvement of cognitive deficits by KXS was closely related to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Western blotting results showed that KXS significantly inhibited the expression of Mt-nd2 and Ndufb6 in AD rats. Integrated analysis indicated that the anti-AD targets of KXS were interrelated and KXS could exert its anti-AD effect by reducing oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, and inflammation.",Biomed Chromatogr

At the two ends of the hypothesis lie the functional protein monomers and the pathology-defining amyloid fibrils, while the early stages of protein aggregation are populated by polymorphic, transient and neurotoxic oligomers. As the structure and activity of oligomers are intertwined, here we show oligomers arising from liquid-liquid phase separation and β-barrel formation, their routes to neurodegeneration, and their role in cerebrovascular perturbation. Together, this Perspective converges on the multifaceted oligomer-axis central to the pathological origin and, hence, the treatment of amyloid diseases.",Nat Commun
40145390,Efficacy of Communication Bridge-2 for primary progressive aphasia: A randomized controlled trial of communication intervention.,"INTRODUCTION: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language-based neurodegenerative dementia, negatively impacts communication and quality of life. Previous non-pharmacologic interventions show promise but lack efficacy trials. Here, outcomes are provided from Communication Bridge-2 (CB2), a speech-language randomized controlled trial (RCT) for PPA.
METHODS: CB2 is the first Phase 2, Stage II, parallel-group RCT delivered via video chat with global enrollment. Ninety-five dyads were randomized into one of two speech-language intervention arms. Primary outcomes included communication confidence and participation measures. Marginal linear models assessed efficacy across ≈12 months.
RESULTS: Ninety-five dyads were randomized from four countries. Experimental arm superiority in communication-participation measurement of goal attainment was demonstrated (66.7% vs 49.1%, respectively, p = 0.006), and corroborated by post-study interviews.
DISCUSSION: Outcomes demonstrate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a person-centered telemedicine intervention for maximizing communication participation for mild-to-moderate PPA, providing a pathway for developing and implementing clinically meaningful interventions for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
HIGHLIGHTS: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) negatively impacts communication participation. Communication Bridge-2 (CB2) is a telemedicine-delivered randomized controlled trial (RCT). Global recruitment of 95 PPA participant dyads into an RCT with low dropout. First international superiority trial for PPA using video chat shows efficacy.

40007076,"A Mediterranean-style diet protects against cognitive and behavioral deficits, adiposity, and Alzheimer's disease-related markers, compared to a macronutrient-matched typical American diet in C57BL/6J mice.","BackgroundResearch suggests that modifying risk factors may prevent or delay up to 40% of dementia cases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, understanding the potential of healthful dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean diet (MD), in AD prevention is crucial. While supplementation of individual Mediterranean foods has demonstrated efficacy in reducing AD biomarkers and cognitive impairment in rodents, the effects of a comprehensive MD warrant further investigation. Additionally, while rodent studies often use a ""Western diet"" as a model for the typical American diet (TAD), these diets generally exceed the macronutrient densities of typical American consumption, particularly in fats and carbohydrates.ObjectiveTo better reflect human diets, we developed two diets for mice that more closely mirrored the macronutrient composition of the traditional MD or the TAD, each with matched macronutrient profiles (50% kcal from carbohydrates, 35% kcal from fat, 15% kcal from protein), and distinct food sources from Mediterranean regions or the U.S., respectively.MethodsMale C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to one diet (MD or TAD) at weaning (21 days of age), which they consumed for six months.ResultsCompared to the TAD, MD animals had lower body weight, abdominal and hepatic fat, serum TNF-α, and central Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, while also exhibiting enhanced exploratory behavior, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and preserved spatial memory. The MD also protected against LPS-induced central inflammation and BDNF loss.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that a comprehensive MD provides protection against metabolic and AD-related markers in wildtype mice, despite matched caloric availability to the TAD.",J Alzheimers Dis
39996748,Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a pivotal characteristic of numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These conditions, distinguished by unique clinical and pathological features, exhibit shared pathways leading to neuronal damage, all of which are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The high metabolic requirements of neurons make even minor mitochondrial deficiencies highly impactful, driving oxidative stress, energy deficits, and aberrant protein processing. Growing evidence from genetic, biochemical, and cellular investigations associates impaired electron transport chain activity and disrupted quality-control mechanisms, such as mitophagy, with the initial phases of disease progression. Furthermore, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and persistent neuroinflammation can establish feedforward cycles that exacerbate neuronal deterioration. Recent clinical research has increasingly focused on interventions aimed at enhancing mitochondrial resilience-through antioxidants, small molecules that modulate the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, or gene-based therapeutic strategies. Concurrently, initiatives to identify dependable mitochondrial biomarkers seek to detect pathological changes prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms. By integrating the current body of knowledge, this review emphasizes the critical role of preserving mitochondrial homeostasis as a viable therapeutic approach. It also addresses the complexities of translating these findings into clinical practice and underscores the potential of innovative strategies designed to delay or potentially halt neurodegenerative processes.",Cells
40142629,Apathy in Dementia: A Pilot Study Providing Insights from Neuropsychiatric and Radiological Perspectives.,"Background: Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in all stages of dementia, significantly complicating patient management. This study examines the prevalence of apathy across Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Vascular Dementia (VD) and explores its associations with cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 200 patients diagnosed with AD, LBD, FTD, and VD along with 100 healthy controls (HCs). Apathy was assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Depression and anxiety in patients were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Scale, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). MRI findings were evaluated using atrophy scales that are routinely utilized in dementia assessments. Results: Apathy was significantly more prevalent in dementia and MCI patients compared to HC. However, there were no significant differences in apathy prevalence among dementia subtypes. Apathy showed no significant correlation with depression, anxiety, or cognitive performance. Notably, MRI analysis revealed a strong association between apathy and orbitofrontal (OF) sulci atrophy. Conclusions: Apathy is a critical symptom in dementia, linked to OF atrophy and presenting challenges in management. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating apathy assessments in clinical practice. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify the pathophysiology and management of apathy in dementia.",J Clin Med
40111921,Brain and blood transcriptome-wide association studies identify five novel genes associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their functional implications remain unclear. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) offer enhanced statistical power by analyzing genetic associations at the gene level rather than at the variant level, enabling assessment of how genetically-regulated gene expression influences AD risk. However, previous AD-TWAS have been limited by small expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reference datasets or reliance on AD-by-proxy phenotypes.ObjectiveTo perform the most powerful AD-TWAS to date using summary statistics from the largest available brain and blood cis-eQTL meta-analyses applied to the largest clinically-adjudicated AD GWAS.MethodsWe implemented the OTTERS TWAS pipeline to predict gene expression using the largest available cis-eQTL data from cortical brain tissue (MetaBrain; N = 2683) and blood (eQTLGen; N = 31,684), and then applied these models to AD-GWAS data (Cases = 21,982; Controls = 44,944).ResultsWe identified and validated five novel gene associations in cortical brain tissue (PRKAG1, C3orf62, LYSMD4, ZNF439, SLC11A2) and six genes proximal to known AD-related GWAS loci (Blood: MYBPC3; Brain: MTCH2, CYB561, MADD, PSMA5, ANXA11). Further, using causal eQTL fine-mapping, we generated sparse models that retained the strength of the AD-TWAS association for MTCH2, MADD, ZNF439, CYB561, and MYBPC3.ConclusionsOur comprehensive AD-TWAS discovered new gene associations and provided insights into the functional relevance of previously associated variants, which enables us to further understand the genetic architecture underlying AD risk.",J Alzheimers Dis
40021385,Integrative single-cell RNA sequencing and mendelian randomization analysis reveal the potential role of synaptic vesicle cycling-related genes in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves alterations in synaptic vesicle cycling (SVC), which significantly affect neuronal communication and function. Therefore, a thorough investigation into the potential roles of SVC-related genes (SVCRGs) in AD can enhance the identification of critical biomarkers that may influence disease progression and treatment responses.
METHODS: The datasets used in this study were sourced exclusively from public databases. By integrating differential expression analysis with Mendelian randomization (MR), we identified SVCRGs as biomarkers for AD. Functional characterization of these biomarkers was performed, followed by integration into a nomogram. Further investigation of immune infiltration in AD patients and healthy individuals was carried out. Ultimately, the potential cellular mechanisms of AD were explored through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis.
RESULTS: ATP6V1D, ATP6V1G2, CLTB, and NSF were identified as biomarkers, exhibiting a positive correlation with each other and a downregulated expression in AD. These markers were pinpointed as protective factors for AD [odds ratio (OR) < 1, P < 0.05], with potential to reduce the risk of the disease. Integrated into a nomogram, they demonstrated satisfactory diagnostic performance and clinical utility, surpassing the use of single gene. They were collectively enriched in pathways related to ""interferon gamma response"", ""inflammatory response"", and ""TNFα signaling via NFκB"". Additionally, an increase in infiltration of 17 immune cell types in AD was noted, particularly cells associated with neuroinflammation such as activated CD8 T cells and various dendritic cells (DCs), suggesting an inflammatory milieu in AD while also displaying a negative correlation with the biomarkers. The cell types were further annotated, revealing specific expressions of biomarkers and uncovering the heterogeneity of excitatory neurons. A significant reduction in the overall number of excitatory neurons under AD conditions was observed, alongside consistent expression of biomarkers during the developmental stages of excitatory neurons.
CONCLUSION: By using MR, we firstly identified four SVCRGs as protective factors for AD, functioning through pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and neuronal damage. These genes had the potential to modulate immune cell infiltration activated in AD patients and exhibited cell-type-specific expression profiles within AD-related cellular contexts. Their findings provide novel insights and valuable references for future research on AD pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40074668,Phosphorylation-Induced Self-Coacervation versus RNA-Assisted Complex Coacervation of Tau Proteins.,"In this study, the role of phosphorylation in the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau, the underlying driving forces, and the potential implications of this separation on protein conformation and subsequent protein aggregation were investigated. We compared in vivo-produced phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and nonphosphorylated tau under different coacervation conditions without adding crowding agents. Our findings revealed that spontaneous phase separation occurs exclusively in p-tau, triggered by a temperature shift from 4 °C to room temperature, and is driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The p-tau self-acervation is reversible with temperature changes. Native mass spectrometry detects only two to nine phosphate groups per p-tau molecule, highlighting the impact of phosphorylation on tau's structural flexibility. Cross-linking mass spectrometry showed fewer long-range contacts in p-tau, suggesting a looser conformation induced by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-induced LLPS and RNA-induced LLPS occurred at different timeframes. However, neither tau nor p-tau formed fibrils without the addition of dextran sulfate or RNA as inducers. Using human kidney epithelial cells expressing the tau R domain fused with fluorescent proteins as reporter cells, we observed aggregates in the nuclear envelope (NE) only in the cells treated with LLPS-state p-tau, which correlates with NE occurrences reported in Alzheimer's disease brain sections. These findings provide deeper insights into the impact of phosphorylation on tau aggregation through an intermediate condensation phase, offering novel perspectives on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.",J Am Chem Soc
40076425,Sub-Immunosuppressive Tacrolimus Ameliorates Amyloid-Beta and Tau Pathology in 3xTg-AD Mice.,"Tacrolimus (TAC) has emerged as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the challenge of balancing its therapeutic benefits against its immunosuppressive effects. This study explores the efficacy of a sub-immunosuppressive TAC dosing regimen to ameliorate AD-related pathologies. TAC was administered daily for 14 days, with drug concentrations measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in whole blood and hippocampal tissue from C57BL6J mice, while immunofluorescence analyses and Western blotting (performed on hippocampal extracts) were conducted in 10-12 month old 3xTg-AD mice to evaluate levels of tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins. The results from LC-MS/MS revealed that lower TAC doses resulted in sub-immunosuppressive blood levels, while still penetrating the hippocampi. Immunofluorescence showed reductions in tau and Aβ proteins in 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, Western blot analyses revealed reductions in tau and Aβ, along with increases in synaptic and autophagy-related proteins. These findings highlight the potential of sub-immunosuppressive TAC doses in effectively targeting AD pathology while minimizing the risk of chronic systemic immunosuppression. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to establish the optimal TAC dosing regimen for AD treatment.",Int J Mol Sci
40066331,Ginsenoside Ro ameliorates cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice via the IBA1/GFAP-MAPK signaling pathway.,"INTRODUCTION: Ginseng, known as the ""king of herbs,"" has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine due to its beneficial properties, including anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. Ginsenosides, the active compounds in ginseng, have shown promise in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Ginsenoside Ro and its underlying mechanisms in AD treatment.
METHODS: In this study, male APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into five groups and treated with Ginsenoside Ro or ginseng for one month. Cognitive function and anxiety were assessed through behavioral tests, including the open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM). To evaluate Aβ deposition, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and the MAPK pathway, various techniques were employed: Thioflavin-T staining, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qRT-PCR analyses.
RESULTS: Ginsenoside Ro significantly improved cognitive function and reduced anxiety in APP/PS1 mice. It also decreased Aβ deposition and ameliorated neuronal apoptosis in the cerebral cortex. The treatment regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase3) and increased the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, Ginsenoside Ro reduced neuroinflammation by decreasing IBA1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes and lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines while enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK in the MAPK pathway were significantly reduced, suggesting a key mechanism for its therapeutic effects.
DISCUSSION: These findings provide strong evidence supporting Ginsenoside Ro as a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. Its effects appear to be mediated through the modulation of the IBA1/GFAP-MAPK pathway, which may offer new insights into AD treatment strategies.",Front Pharmacol

However, astaxanthin possesses low oral bioavailability, and thus, astaxanthin extract from Haematococcus pluvialis was formulated into a nanoemulsion to improve its bioavailability and administered to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like rats to study its possible neuroprotective benefits. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion was administered orally once a day for 28 days to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rats at concentrations of 160, 320, and 640 mg/kg of body weight (bw) and subsequently assessed for cognitive function using behavioral assessments. Brain samples were collected for the assessment of AD biomarkers. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion at a dosage of 640 mg/kg bw significantly improved spatial learning, spatial memory, and recognition memory against STZ-AD rats. At 320 and 640 mg/kg bw, astaxanthin nanoemulsion significantly reduced levels of hippocampus synaptosomal amyloid beta and paired-helical fibrillary tau protein while increasing neuron survival. Additionally, astaxanthin nanoemulsion at 640 mg/kg bw significantly increased acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion at all treatment dosages significantly reduced malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, and neuroinflammatory mediators (GFAP and TNF-α). Astaxanthin nanoemulsion supplementation has the potential to improve cognitive function and synaptic function by lowering amyloid beta and tau levels, as well as preserve neuron integrity by reducing neuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation, indicating that it may be able to treat some of the underlying causes of AD.",Metab Brain Dis

40038965,Ranking the Importance of Spatiotemporal Windows of EEG Signals Results in a Better Alzheimer's Disease Prediction.,"The integration of Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with machine learning holds the promise of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing personalized insights into the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in particular. The complex nature of EEG signals, influenced by individual variability and noise, poses difficulties in interpreting the rich and dynamic embedded information, thus requiring algorithms capable of discerning meaningful patterns. In this work, we develop a novel approach for ranking the importance of spatiotemporal EEG information based on the Smart Aggregation Framework (SAF) framework in which each spatiotemporal window is weighted non-linearly using the Boltzmann distribution with a hyperparameter, analogous to temperature. We validate our model on a dataset that includes EEG recordings of 65 healthy and AD subjects. We rank the significant spatiotemporal windows for each subject and show that the features of the top-ranked windows provide significant separability between the AD and healthy subjects. We determine the most significant electrode and show that taking only the top two electrodes provides a better classification of the AD patients compared with taking all the electrodes or a random pair. Besides providing cutting-edge accuracy in classifying AD, our work provides an interpretability framework for ranking spatiotemporal information in EEG signals that can be harnessed to enhance the diagnostics of other neurodegenerative conditions.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40148060,"Neuroglia in neurodegeneration: Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington disease.","The conspicuous rise of chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer (AD), Parkinson (PD), and Huntington (HD) diseases, is currently without disease-modifying therapies and accompanied by an excessive rate of unsuccessful clinical trials. This reflects a profound lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, indicating that the current paradigms guiding disease modeling and drug development are in need of reconsideration. The role of neuroglia, namely astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases emerged during the last decades. This chapter provides the state-of-the-art update on the changes of astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes in AD, PD, and HD. A growing body of evidence suggests that homeostatic and defensive functions of glial cells are compromised at different disease stages, leading to increased susceptibility of neurons to noxious stimuli, eventually resulting in their malfunction and degeneration. Investments are needed in the generation of novel preclinical models suitable for studying glial pathology, in ""humanizing"" research, and in-depth investigation of glial cell alterations to slow down and, possibly, halt and prevent the rise of neurodegenerative disease.

40143085,Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Amyloid Beta: Insights from Molecular Dynamics-Part A: Endogenous Compounds and Repurposed Drugs.,"The amyloid hypothesis is the predominant model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, suggesting that amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is the primary driver of neurotoxicity and a cascade of pathological events in the central nervous system. Aβ aggregation into oligomers and deposits triggers various processes, such as vascular damage, inflammation-induced astrocyte and microglia activation, disrupted neuronal ionic homeostasis, oxidative stress, abnormal kinase and phosphatase activity, tau phosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, cognitive dysfunction, synaptic loss, cell death, and, ultimately, dementia. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful structure-based drug design (SBDD) approach that aids in understanding the properties, functions, and mechanisms of action or inhibition of biomolecules. As the only method capable of simulating atomic-level internal motions, MD provides unique insights that cannot be obtained through other techniques. Integrating experimental data with MD simulations allows for a more comprehensive understanding of biological processes and molecular interactions. This review summarizes and evaluates MD studies from the past decade on small molecules, including endogenous compounds and repurposed drugs, that inhibit amyloid beta. Furthermore, it outlines key considerations for future MD simulations of amyloid inhibitors, offering a potential framework for studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of amyloid beta inhibition by small molecules.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel)

METHODS: The diagnostic performance of the Lumipulse G plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio was evaluated using Aβ and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as reference standards in a clinic cohort (n = 391) and a community cohort (n = 121).
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 exhibited high performance for abnormal statuses of Aβ PET (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.963 to 0.966) and tau PET (AUC: 0.947 to 0.974), which were clinically equivalent to those of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181/Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher than those of blood p-tau217, Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and p-tau181/Aβ42 in both clinic and community cohorts. Applying a two-cutoff approach improved the specificity without reducing sensitivity. The p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio had a lower intermediate percentage than p-tau217 alone in both clinic (10.6% vs 13.0%) and community (16.5% vs 31.4%) cohorts.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 has high performance in detecting cerebral AD pathologies, thus offering a promising tool for clinical diagnosis and community screening of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lumipulse G plasma p-tau217 and the p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio accurately identified abnormal Aβ and tau PET statuses in both clinical and community cohorts. The performance of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio were equivalent to CSF tests. Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio outperformed p-tau217 alone in identifying Aβ PET positivity, and this superiority is more obvious in the community cohort, suggesting an advantage in the early diagnosis of AD.

Improved understanding of current pathways in diagnosis and initial care of patients with dementia can help inform choices around how best to integrate new technologies in existing care structures.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the care management pathways defined by the involvement of specialist and primary care for individuals with newly diagnosed dementia. It also seeks to characterise individuals in different management pathways based on resource use prior to diagnosis, the type of dementia diagnosis received, and the proportion who receive symptomatic anti-dementia drug treatment.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study SETTING: Stockholm region, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: All newly diagnosed dementia cases between 1st January 2018 to 30th June 2020 (n = 9,781). Dementia diagnoses in primary care were based on Regional Stockholm health care database and diagnoses in specialist care were based on the National Patient Register in Sweden.
MEASUREMENTS: Care management pathways were categorized into three groups: primary care only (diagnosed and followed up in primary care), specialist, no follow-up (diagnosed in specialist care but not followed up in specialist care), and specialist with follow-up (diagnosed and followed up in specialist care). These classifications were based on patients' care episodes from the date of diagnosis and the subsequent 18 months. age at diagnosis, resource utilisation one-year prior diagnosis and diagnosis given and symptomatic anti-dementia treatment 18 months after initial diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 9,781 newly diagnosed dementia cases were identified. In the 18 months following diagnosis, 63 % of patients were diagnosed either partly or fully in specialist care, while 37 % were diagnosed solely in primary care. Patients diagnosed and managed only in primary care were older, spent more days in hospital, and received more social care in the year preceding their diagnosis. Their total care costs were also the highest. Alzheimer's disease was the most common diagnosis (48 %), while 27 % had an unspecified dementia diagnosis, varying by care setting (61 % for patients managed in primary care only and 6 % for patients diagnosed and followed up in specialist care). Overall, 47 % of patients received symptomatic anti-dementia treatment, with the highest share for patients diagnosed and followed up in specialist care (73 %) and the lowest in primary care only (19 %). Diagnosis varied by age and care setting Alzheimer's was most common in settings involving specialist care, whereas unspecified dementia was more common in primary care only regardless of age.
CONCLUSION: The findings that patients managed exclusively in primary care were older, had higher pre-diagnosis resource utilisation, and were less likely to receive specific diagnoses or anti-dementia treatments highlight the crucial role of primary care in diagnosing and managing dementia among older individuals with complex needs. Further research is needed to explore primary care's role in diagnosis and treatment across diverse healthcare systems. Future research is needed to explore whether and how new diagnostic tools and treatment for AD could facilitate timely diagnosis and care for older individuals with dementia in primary care.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40127855,Gastrodin alleviates Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced glycolytic dysfunction via activating PI3K/AKT/BACH1 signaling in Alzheimer's disease models.,"Cerebral glycolytic alteration has been identified as an important contributor to the pathological progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has shown that gastrodin (GAS) possesses neuroprotection in various experimental models of AD, but its specific mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we determined whether GAS exerted neuroprotective effects on AD models through regulating PI3K/AKT/BACH1 signaling axis. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were intracerebroventricularly injected with Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>, to establish an AD model, followed by the administration of GAS (30, 60 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 21 days. Treatment of GAS markedly alleviated the downregulation of p-PI3K Tyr199/458, p-AKT Ser473, BACH1 and HK1 in the hippocampus of the Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced AD mice. To further explore the mechanism of GAS-mediated neuroprotection, an in vitro AD cellular model was established by challenging HT22 cells with Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>. In the Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> induced cells, the expression of BACH1, p-PI3K Tyr199/458 and p-AKT Ser473 was reduced, the mRNA and protein levels of HK1 were decreased, and the levels of pyruvate and ATP were reduced. After treatment of GAS, the decline of these indicators was reversed. In addition, overexpression of BACH1 by lentivirus transfection significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of HK1, thereby enhancing glycolytic function and protecting HT22 cells from Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced injury. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay-real-time quantitative PCR revealed that BACH1 directly bound to the HK1 promoter region. Collectively, these findings suggest that GAS can play a protective role in Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced experimental AD models by increasing HK1 expression and ameliorating glycolytic dysfunction through activation of the PI3K/AKT/BACH1 signaling axis.",Exp Neurol
40087862,Amyloid-β Dysregulates Oligodendroglial Lineage Cell Dynamics and Myelination via PKC in the Zebrafish Spinal Cord.,"Soluble forms of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide have been proposed as candidates to induce oligodendrocyte (OL) and myelin dysfunctions in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Nevertheless, little is known about how Aβ affects OL differentiation and myelination in vivo, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Aβ on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Aβ altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbpa:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Aβ increased the number of myrf<sup>+</sup> and mbp<sup>+</sup> OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Aβ also increased the number of Sox10<sup>+</sup>cells, myelin sheaths per OL, and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord at 8 dpf compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Aβ-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Gö6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels. Altogether, not only do we demonstrate that Aβ induces a precocious oligodendroglial differentiation leading to dysregulated myelination, but we also identified PKC as a key player in Aβ-induced pathology.",Glia
40165595,Molecular mechanism of the effect of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution on the conformation of the tau<sub>267-312</sub> monomer.,"Alzheimer's disease is generally believed to be caused by abnormal aggregation of tau protein; however, there remains a lack of understanding about the aggregation process of tau protein in a solution environment. To explore the conformational properties of the tau protein monomer (tau<sub>267-312</sub>) in the presence of zinc and magnesium ions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of tau<sub>267-312</sub> in solutions of zinc chloride and magnesium chloride at different concentrations and compared these results with those obtained in pure water. The calculation results show that the β-sheet content increases significantly in the presence of zinc and magnesium ions, which causes a more compact structure for the tau protein monomers. Furthermore, it was found that stronger interactions between residues, as well as alterations in hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, are molecular mechanisms driving structural changes within the tau protein monomers. These findings suggest that zinc and magnesium ions facilitate a more stable conformation and promote the aggregation of tau protein monomers, which is important for understanding the aggregation and folding process of tau protein in the environment of saline solution.",Soft Matter
40096940,Comparing levetiracetam and zonisamide effects on rivastigmine anti-Alzheimer's activity in aluminum chloride-induced Alzheimer's-like disease in rats: Impact on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and amyloid β.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most progressive form of neurodegenerative disease, which severely impairs cognitive function. The leading class of drugs used to treat AD is acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-Is) as Rivastigmine (RIVA), partially ameliorate its cognitive symptoms. Since epilepsy is a common comorbidity with AD, we explored the potential that new the antiepileptic drugs; Levetiracetam (LEV) and Zonisamide (ZNS) may possess an additional therapeutic benefit to RIVA in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced AD rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: AlCl<sub>3</sub> was used to provoke AD in rats which were then supplemented with treatment drugs for 2 weeks. Treated groups were: Control, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, RIVA, LEV, RIVA + LEV, ZNS and RIVA + ZNS. Then, the behavioral tests; passive avoidance (PA), Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) were conducted to assess cognitive behavior and memory. The Hippocampal Aβ assembly was thoroughly examined by histopathology and ELISA. α7 Nicotinic ACh receptors' (α7nAChRs) expression was assessed immunohistochemically and by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Caspase 3 expression was also assessed by real-time qPCR in hippocampal tissues.
RESULTS: AlCl<sub>3</sub> administration impaired memory and cognitive functions in rats, augmented hippocampal Aβ deposition, with subsequent neurodegeneration and α7nAChRs down-regulation. LEV, but not ZNS, administration significantly mitigated AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced cognitive impairment probably through suppression of amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, enhancement of neurogenesis and α7nAChRs expression. When combined to RIVA, ZNS treatment negatively affected cognition possibly through its impact on hippocampal Aβ and subsequent neuronal damage.
CONCLUSION: Although our results indicated that neither LEV nor ZNS provided any extra benefit to cognitive enhancements in AD rats receiving rivastigmine, LEV demonstrated positive effects individually while ZNS had negative effects when combined with RIVA. As a result, this study suggests the use of LEV rather than ZNS for managing epilepsy in patients with AD given that Alzheimer's and epilepsy can coexist.",Brain Res
39996836,The Cross-Talk Between the Peripheral and Brain Cholesterol Metabolisms.,"Cholesterol is an essential element for the development and normal function of the central nervous system. While peripheral cholesterol is influenced by liver metabolism and diet, brain cholesterol metabolism takes place in an isolated system due to the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, cross-talk occurs between the brain and periphery, specifically through metabolites such as oxysterols that play key roles in regulating cholesterol balance. Several neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease are considered to be affected by the loss of this balance. Also, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia needs to consider these discrete interferences between brain and peripheral cholesterol and the possible implications of each therapeutic approach. This is particularly important because of 27-hydroxycholesterol and 24-hydroxycholesterol, which can cross the BBB and are involved in cholesterol metabolism. This paper examines the metabolic pathways of cholesterol metabolism in the brain and periphery and focuses on the complex cross-talk between these metabolisms. Also, we emphasize the regulatory role of the BBB and the need for an integrated approach to cholesterol management.",Curr Issues Mol Biol
40089052,Increasing nitric oxide availability via ingestion of nitrate-rich beetroot juice improves vascular responsiveness in individuals with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Poor vascular function and reduced nitric oxide (NO)-bioavailability have been recognized to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A non-pharmacological treatment that is gaining clinical interest in the context of vascular function is dietary inorganic nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) supplementation which increases NO-bioavailability through the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> -nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) - NO pathway. This treatment has been demonstrated to improve vascular function in several clinical populations, but no study has investigated the effects in individuals with AD. Therefore, changes in plasma NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and vascular responsiveness (hyperemic response to single-passive leg movement (ΔPLM)) were measured in individuals with AD (n = 10, 76 ± 9 years), healthy elderly (OLD, n = 10, 75 ± 6 years), and young individuals (YN, n = 10, 25 ± 4 years) before (T0) and hourly for 4 h (T1, T2, T3, and T4) after ingestion of either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-rich beetroot juice (BR) or a placebo (PLA). No changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, nor ΔPLM were detected in any group following PLA intake. Plasma NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> increased significantly in all three groups at T1 (p &lt; 0.001) and remained elevated for the rest of the trial. The same trend was found in ΔPLM, which significantly increased in all three groups over the time (p &lt; 0.001). However, AD exhibited significantly lower ΔPLM values at any time point compared to YN (p &lt; 0.001) and OLD (p &lt; 0.001). These data suggest that AD-individuals included in this study were able to reduce NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and to increase NO-mediated vascular responsiveness as non-AD-individuals. Other mechanisms, beyond NO-bioavailability, may be involved in vascular dysfunction in patients with AD. This research suggests that an acute administration of inorganic nitrate is not enough to revert chronically adapted vascular properties and completely restore vascular responsiveness in AD.",Nitric Oxide
40046824,s-SuStaIn: Scaling subtype and stage inference via simultaneous clustering of subjects and biomarkers.,"Event-based models (EBM) provide an important platform for modeling disease progression. This work successfully extends previous EBM approaches to work with larger sets of biomarkers while simultaneously modeling heterogeneity in disease progression trajectories. We develop and validate the s-SuStain method for scalable event-based modeling of disease progression subtypes using large numbers of features. s-SuStaIn is typically an order of magnitude faster than its predecessor (SuStaIn). Moreover, we perform a case study with s-SuStaIn using open access cross-sectional Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) data to stage AD patients into four subtypes based on dynamic disease progression. s-SuStaIn shows that the inferred subtypes and stages predict progression to AD among MCI subjects. The subtypes show difference in AD incidence-rates and reveal clinically meaningful progression trajectories when mapped to a brain atlas.",Proc Mach Learn Res
40031545,CPST-GAN: Conditional Probabilistic State Transition Generative Adversarial Network With the Biomedical Large Foundation Models.,"The risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for its early prevention and treatment. However, current risk prediction methods face challenges in effectively extracting and fusing multiomics features, particularly overlooking the multilevel evolutionary mechanisms of AD. This article combines biomedical large foundation models with the conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to mine the evolutionary patterns of AD by considering the regulatory effect of genes on brain lesions. Specifically, we first use biomedical large foundation models to effectively construct high-quality imaging genetic features. Next, a conditional probabilistic state transition mathematical model is constructed to describe AD progression as state transitions of brain regions under genetic regulations. Based on the mathematical model, a conditional probabilistic state transition GAN (CPST-GAN) is proposed. This algorithm can mine the dynamic evolutionary patterns of AD by fusing brain imaging and genetic features to achieve risk prediction of AD. Finally, experiments on the public imaging genetics datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of CPST-GAN in evolutionary pattern mining and risk prediction of AD. This article not only provides a reliable intelligence algorithm for early intervention of AD but also offers new insights for future research on AD pathogenesis.

40119889,Polyoxometalates bind multiple targets involved in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by brain aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and Tau tangles. Despite extensive research, effective therapy for AD remains elusive. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of inorganic compounds with diverse chemical structures and properties, are emerging as potential candidates for AD treatment due to their ability to target key molecular players implicated in disease pathogenesis, such as Aβ, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl acetylcholinesterase (BChE). Here, we use molecular docking to predict the binding pose and affinities of POMs to 10 top targets associated with AD. First, we validate our method by replicating experimentally known binding of POMs to Aβ (ΔG = - 9.67 kcal/mol), AChE (ΔG = - 9.39 kcal/mol) and BChE (ΔG = - 10.86 kcal/mol). Then, using this method, we show that POM can also bind β-secretase 1 (BACE1, ΔG = - 10.14 kcal/mol), presenilin 1 (PSEN1, ΔG = - 10.65 kcal/mol), presenilin 2 (PSEN2, ΔG = - 7.94 kcal/mol), Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP, ΔG = - 7.26 kcal/mol), Apolipoprotein E (APOE4, ΔG = - 10.05 kcal/mol), Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT, ΔG = - 5.28 kcal/mol) depending on phosphorylation, and α-synuclein (SNCA, ΔG = - 7.64 kcal/mol). Through such binding, POMs offer the potential to mitigate APP cleavage, Aβ oligomer neurotoxicity, Aβ aggregation, thereby attenuating disease progression. Overall, our molecular docking study represents a powerful tool in the discovery of POM-based therapeutics for AD, facilitating the development of novel treatments for AD.",J Biol Inorg Chem
40167827,Autoradiographic comparison between [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB and [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 in human brain tissue.,"BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β imaging through positron emission tomography (PET) has significantly transformed Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB has been widely used for imaging β-amyloid plaques due to its high affinity and selectivity for amyloid deposits. [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 is a more recently developed amyloid-PET imaging agent, which structurally resembles PiB and has less non-specific binding in the white matter than other <sup>18</sup>F-labeled compounds. The purpose of this study is to compare the in vitro binding properties of the amyloid-PET radiotracers [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB and [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 in post-mortem human brain tissue. Total binding was assessed by autoradiography in prefrontal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate cortices and hippocampal sections of healthy control (HC) and AD autopsy-confirmed brain tissues. Furthermore, the displacement of [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 by unlabeled PiB was evaluated in the above-mentioned sections of AD brain tissues.
RESULTS: For both radiotracers, we found significant differences (p &lt; 0.0001) between HC and AD tissues binding in the prefrontal cortex ([<sup>11</sup>C]PiB Cohen's d = 3.424, [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 Cohen's d = 5.070), inferior parietal cortex ([<sup>11</sup>C]PiB Cohen's d = 3.156, [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 Cohen's d = 3.959), posterior cingulate cortex ([<sup>11</sup>C]PiB Cohen's d = 1.781, [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 Cohen's d = 3.434), and hippocampus ([<sup>11</sup>C]PiB Cohen's d = 1.320, [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 Cohen's d = 3.696). Higher binding was detected for [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 compared to [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB in AD prefrontal, inferior parietal and posterior cingulate cortices, while binding in the hippocampus was comparable for both radioligands. Strong correlations between [<sup>18</sup>]AZD4694 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB were found in the prefrontal (R = 0.959, p &lt; 0.0001), inferior parietal (R = 0.893, p &lt; 0.0001), posterior cingulate (R = 0.838, p = 0.0006) cortices and hippocampus (R = 0.750, p &lt; 0.0001). Bland-Altman analyses revealed strong agreement between [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB and [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 in the prefrontal, inferior parietal, and posterior cingulate cortices, but lower agreement in the hippocampus. Displacement studies confirmed high binding affinity of PiB in all tissues, indicating that both amyloid-PET agents compete for the same binding sites.
CONCLUSIONS: This head-to-head study provides evidence that while [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB bindings are highly correlated with both tracers competing for the same binding sites, [<sup>18</sup>F]AZD4694 has a slightly higher effect size when comparing between neuropathologically-confirmed AD and HC brain tissues.",EJNMMI Res
40059446,Differences in Finger Dexterity in Patients With Mild and Moderate Alzheimer's Disease-A Study of Cognitive Function by Disease Severity.,"AIM: This study aimed to estimate the relationship between finger function and cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AD at the Outpatient Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorder of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology underwent a 15-s bimanual alternating tapping task to measure finger movements. After finger movement measurements, we classified the severity of AD into mild and moderate and compared the finger movements. The Mann-Whitney U test and effect size were used to compare parameter values between the two groups (mild and moderate AD), and the calculated p values were corrected using the Bonferroni method. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the association between finger parameters and cognitive function (Mini-Mental Examination [MMSE]).
RESULTS: Data from 163 patients with AD were analyzed. When comparing finger parameters between the mild AD (64 individuals) and moderate AD (99 individuals) groups, the moderate AD group demonstrated fewer taps (p = 0.005; r = 0.22) and a longer interval between taps with the thumb and index finger (p = 0.007; r = 0.21) than the mild AD group. The correlation between the MMSE score and finger function was weakly positive for the number of taps and weakly negative for the average of tapping interval.
CONCLUSIONS: These parameters reflect the decline in finger function associated with the advanced stages of dementia and may help assess the severity of AD. Additionally, these findings may have clinical utility in assessing the severity of AD, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy for differentiating stages of AD.",Brain Behav
40034510,Protective effect of chlorogenic acid on cognitive impairment in rats with early Alzheimer's disease via Wnt signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Chlorogenic acid (CGA) has neuroprotective properties associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact mechanism by which CGA prevents cognitive impairment in AD remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of CGA on cognitive impairment in rats with early AD via the Wnt signaling pathway.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of CGA on cognitive impairment in an early AD rat model via the Wnt signaling pathway.
METHODS: Forty male rats were randomly divided into the control group (CON), AD group (AD), CGA 100 groups and CGA 150 groups with 10 rats in each group. In addition to CON group, the other three groups of rats were injected with 10 μL Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> in the unilateral ventricle to create the model. After 3 days of molding, CGA100 group (gavage of CGA at a dose of 150 mg/kg/d) and CGA150 group (gavage of CGA at a dose of 150 mg/kg/d) were given CGA for 6 weeks. Morris water maze test, Nissl staining test, and western blot test were used.
RESULTS: CGA reduced the escape latency of Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced early AD rats, shortened the swimming distance, and extended the activity time of the target quadrant. CGA increased the number of Nissl, decreased the expression of inflammatory factors, decreased the expression levels of GSK-3β, GFAP, and tau, and increased the expression levels of DVL2 and β-catenin.
CONCLUSIONS: CGA can protect the cognitive impairment of early AD rats via Wnt signaling pathway.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40098489,Association Between Serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Levels and Cognitive Function in Middle-Aged and Older Women.,"BACKGROUND: Researchers have proposed that there is a potential link between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and cognitive function, yet the evidence remains inconclusive. The current study aims to identify the association between serum FSH levels and cognitive performance, and to examine whether this association varies by cognitive diagnosis, serum estradiol (E2) levels, or cognitive domain.
METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional study used a clinical database comprising female visitors to memory clinics at three referral hospitals in Korea. Venous blood samples were collected to determine serum FSH and E2 concentrations via immunoradiometric assay. Cognitive performance was evaluated using either the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease or the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery, while cognitive diagnoses were made via clinical diagnostic interviews.
RESULTS: Among the 159 participants (normal cognition [NC], n = 70; mild cognitive impairment [MCI], n = 52; Alzheimer's disease [AD] dementia, n = 37), there were no significant differences in serum FSH levels associated with cognitive diagnosis. In women with NC, serum FSH levels were found to be positively correlated with cognitive performance in global cognition, nonverbal memory, and executive function, even after adjusting for serum E2 level and its interaction with serum FSH level. However, no significant correlations were observed in women with MCI and AD dementia.
CONCLUSION: The association between circulating FSH and cognition may be independent from circulating E2, but it may depend on disease progression or cognitive domains. This suggests a potential role of gonadotropin in cognitive decline in elderly women.",J Korean Med Sci
40017733,Assessing cognitive flexibility in mice using a custom-built touchscreen chamber.,"Automated touchscreen systems have become increasingly prevalent in rodent model screening. This technology has significantly enhanced cognitive and behavioral assessments in mice and has bridged the translational gap between basic research using rodent models and human clinical research. Our study introduces a custom-built touchscreen operant conditioning chamber powered by a Raspberry Pi and a commercially available computer tablet, which effectively addresses the significant cost barriers traditionally associated with this technology. In order to test our prototype, we decided to train C57BL/6 mice on a visual discrimination serial-reversal task, and both C57BL/6 and App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>strain - an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mouse model - on a new location discrimination serial-reversal task. The results demonstrated a clear progression toward asymptotic performance, particularly in the location discrimination task, which also revealed potential genotype-specific deficits, with App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice displaying an increase in the average number of errors in the first reversal as well as in perseverative errors, compared to wild-type mice. These results validate the practical utility of our touchscreen apparatus and underline its potential to provide insights into the behavioral and cognitive markers of neurobiological disorders.",Front Behav Neurosci

We investigated the associations between regional tau standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and GMV in AD signature regions. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the potential mediating effects of local and distant GMV in the relationship between tau pathology and cognition.ResultsThe study indicated that increased <sup>18</sup>F-fortaucipir SUVR and decreased GMV were related to cognitive performance in MCI and AD patients. Compared to NC group, the number of brain regions with local and distant correlations between GMV and SUVR was greater in AD/MCI group. Mediation analysis revealed that GMV served as a significant mediator between tau pathology and cognition in local regions. Furthermore, distant effects were also observed, with hippocampal atrophy partially mediated the relationship between entorhinal cortex tau pathology and cognition. Meanwhile, medial parietal lobe atrophy partially mediated the relationship between medial temporal lobe tau deposition and cognition.ConclusionsOur findings provide an anatomically detailed insight into relationships between tau, GMV and cognition, especially in entorhinal cortex-hippocampus, temporal-parietal lobe cortical circuits.",J Alzheimers Dis
40137577,Longitudinal Analysis of Amyloid PET and Brain MRI for Predicting Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease: Findings from the ADNI Cohort.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the predictive power of integrated longitudinal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for determining the likelihood of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We included 180 patients with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with baseline and 2-year follow-up scans obtained using F-18 florbetapir PET and MRI. Patients were categorized as converters (progressing to AD) or nonconverters based on a 6-year follow-up. Quantitative analyses included the calculation of amyloid burden using the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), brain amyloid smoothing scores (BASSs), brain atrophy indices (BAIs), and their integration into shape features. Longitudinal changes and receiver operating characteristic analyses assessed the predictive power of these biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among 180 patients with MCI, 76 (42.2%) were converters, who exhibited significantly higher baseline and 2-year follow-up values for SUVR, BASS, BAI, and shape features than nonconverters (p &lt; 0.001). Shape features demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for conversion, with areas under the curve of 0.891 at baseline and 0.898 at 2 years. Percent change analyses revealed significant increases in brain atrophy; amyloid deposition changes showed a paradoxical decrease in converters. Additionally, strong associations were observed between longitudinal changes in shape features and neuropsychological test results.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of amyloid PET and MRI biomarkers enhances the prediction of AD progression in patients with MCI. These findings support the potential of combined imaging approaches for early diagnosis and targeted interventions in AD.",Tomography
40120708,Advancing Alzheimer's disease therapy through engineered exosomal Macromolecules.,"Exosomes are a subject of continuous investigation due to their function as extracellular vesicles (EVs) that significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exosomes have shown the potential to carry both therapeutic and pathogenic materials; hence, researchers have used exosomes for medication delivery applications. Exosomes have reduced immunogenicity when used as natural drug delivery vehicles. This guarantees the efficient delivery of the medication without causing significant side reactions. Exosomes have lately enabled the potential for drug delivery in AD, along with promising future therapeutic uses for the detection of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, exosomes have been examined for their prospective use in illness diagnosis and prediction before the manifestation of symptoms. This review will document prior studies and will concentrate on the rationale behind the substantial potential of exosomes in the treatment of AD and their prospective use as a diagnostic and predictive tool for this condition.",Brain Res
40067757,Neurophysiological correlates of subjective cognitive decline in perimenopausal and postmenopausal midlife women at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate neurophysiological correlates of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) among midlife women at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We examined 156 cognitively normal perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years, with an AD family history and/or apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype, who were not on menopause hormone therapy. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing, health and menopausal symptom questionnaires, and brain volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance (MR) measuring cerebral blood flow, and 31phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) measuring mitochondria high-energy phosphates (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], phosphocreatine [PCr], inorganic phosphate [Pi]). We used multivariable regressions to compare outcomes between participants with and without SCD and to identify the main correlates of SCD status.
RESULTS: The SCD group (n = 53) exhibited worse verbal memory and executive function test performance (multivariable adjusted P = 0.029) compared to controls (n = 103). On brain imaging, the SCD group showed higher PCr/ATP in precuneus, posterior cingulate, and parietal regions compared to controls (multivariable adjusted P < 0.05) and no overall differences in Pi/ATP, PCr/Pi, volume, or cerebral blood flow measures. Results were controlled for age, race, smoking status, hysterectomy status, presence of vasomotor symptoms, menopause symptom severity score, past menopause hormone therapy usage, history of depression, AD family history, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 status. The factors more strongly associated with SCD status were inferior parietal PCr/ATP, menopause symptom severity, and presence of vasomotor symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Among perimenopausal and postmenopausal midlife women, SCD was associated with altered brain mitochondria bioenergetics in some brain regions similarly affected by AD, warranting further investigation.",Menopause
40012737,Exploring the microbiota-gut-brain axis: impact on brain structure and function.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) plays a significant role in the maintenance of brain structure and function. The MGBA serves as a conduit between the CNS and the ENS, facilitating communication between the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain via diverse pathways. In the initial stages of this review, we will examine the way how MGBA affects neurogenesis, neuronal dendritic morphology, axonal myelination, microglia structure, brain blood barrier (BBB) structure and permeability, and synaptic structure. Furthermore, we will review the potential mechanistic pathways of neuroplasticity through MGBA influence. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a pivotal role in the MGBA, where they can modify the BBB. We will therefore discuss how SCFAs can influence microglia, neuronal, and astrocyte function, as well as their role in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequently, we will examine the technical strategies employed to study MGBA interactions, including using germ-free (GF) animals, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and antibiotics-induced dysbiosis. Finally, we will examine how particular bacterial strains can affect brain structure and function. By gaining a deeper understanding of the MGBA, it may be possible to facilitate research into microbial-based pharmacological interventions and therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases.",Front Neuroanat
40111762,Novel modelling approaches to elucidate the genetic architecture of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Up to 30% of older adults meet pathological criteria for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at autopsy yet never show signs of cognitive impairment. Recent work has highlighted genetic drivers of this resilience, or better-than-expected cognitive performance given a level of neuropathology, that allow the aged brain to protect itself from the downstream consequences of amyloid and tau deposition. However, models of resilience have been constrained by reliance on measures of neuropathology, substantially limiting the number of participants available for analysis. We sought to determine if novel approaches using APOE allele status, age, and other demographic variables as a proxy for neuropathology could still effectively quantify resilience and uncover novel genetic drivers associated with better-than-expected cognitive performance while vastly expanding sample size and statistical power. Leveraging 20,513 participants from eight well-characterized cohort studies of aging, we determined the effects of genetic variants on resilience metrics using mixed-effects regressions. The outcome of interest was residual cognitive resilience, quantified from residuals in three cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and language) and built within two frameworks: ""silver"" models, which obviate the requirement for neuropathological data (n=17,241), and ""gold"" models, which include post-mortem neuropathological assessments (n=3,272). We then performed cross-ancestry genome wide association studies (European ancestry n=18,269, African ancestry n=2,244), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses. All analyses were conducted across all participants and repeated when restricted to those with unimpaired cognition at baseline. Despite different modeling approaches, the silver and gold phenotypes were highly correlated (R=0.77-0.88) and displayed comparable performance in quantifying better-than or worse-than-expected cognition, enabling silver-gold meta-analyses. Genetic correlation analyses highlighted associations of resilience with multiple neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular traits (PFDR values < 5.0x10-2). In pathway-level tests, we observed three significant associations with resilience: metabolism of amino acids and derivatives (PFDR=4.1x10-2), negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta production (PFDR=1.9x10-2), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (PFDR=3.9x10-4). Finally, in single-variant analyses, we identified a locus on chromosome 17 approaching genome-wide significance among cognitively unimpaired participants (index single nucleotide polymorphism: rs757022, minor allele frequency = 0.18, β=0.08, P=1.1x10-7). The top variant at this locus (rs757022) was significantly associated with expression of numerous ATP-binding cassette genes in brain. Overall, through validating a novel modeling approach, we demonstrate the utility of silver models of resilience to increase statistical power and participant diversity.",Brain

39989154,Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework-Based NIR-II Activated Hydrogen Production for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice.,"Oxidative stress is the crucial pathologic factor for causing neuron death and cognitive impairment in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a special antioxidant, molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is responsible for alleviating oxidative stress and associated inflammatory symptoms. However, in vivo continuous and efficient hydrogen accumulation is rather difficult to realize, thus frequent dosing is required to ensure the desired therapeutic effect. Herein, hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composites are rationally designed to achieve sustainable near-infrared II (NIR-II) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction for relieving neuroinflammation in AD model mice. The HOFs composites mainly consist of three parts: building block porphyrin as the photocatalyst, DSM (NIR-II-absorbing pyridinium hemicyanine dye) as fluorescent emitter, and platinum nanoparticles as co-catalyst. Under NIR-II laser illumination, DSM acts as an energy transducer to activate porphyrin to produce reductive hydrogen in situ. Specially, porphyrin selectively binds with the accumulated Cu ions in Aβ plaques and boosts H<sub>2</sub> evolution. KLVFFAED (KD8) is covalently grafted on the HOFs to improve the blood-brain barrier permeability in vivo. This designed system exhibits an admirable therapeutic effect for relieving inflammation and recovering cognitive disorder in AD model mice, thus providing a new way for exploring HOFs used for sustainable hydrogen therapy.",Small
40158867,Therapeutic potential of DDQ in enhancing mitochondrial health and cognitive function in Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of DDQ, a small molecule in the humanized Abeta knockin (hAbKI) mice that represents late-onset AD. Our findings demonstrate that DDQ treatment significantly improves cognitive performance as assessed through behavioral tests, including the rotarod, open field, Y-maze, and Morris water maze, compared to untreated hAbKI mice. At the molecular level, DDQ promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by enhanced expression of key proteins like PGC1α, NRF1, and TFAM. Additionally, DDQ treatment facilitated mitophagy, as indicated by elevated levels of PINK1 and Parkin, and reduced neuroinflammation, reflected by decreased Iba1 and GFAP levels. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a marked improvement in mitochondrial morphology, with increased mitochondrial length and reduced mitochondrial numbers in DDQ-treated mice. Furthermore, DDQ treatment led to an increase in mitophagic vacuoles, suggesting that it effectively removes dysfunctional mitochondria. Taken together, for the first time, our study results support the potential of DDQ as a promising neuroprotective agent for late-onset AD, addressing mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Our study focused on developing small molecules that modulate mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics and neuroinflammatory pathways for aging, AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",Mitochondrion
40134533,Alteration of prefrontal functional connectivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: an fNIRS study.,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital for delaying its progression through timely intervention. The preclinical stage, the longest phase of AD, often goes undetected due to a lack of noticeable symptoms. Developing an accessible and quantitative screening method for AD is essential for enabling appropriate interventions during this stage.
METHODS: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate prefrontal functional connectivity in preclinical AD subjects. A total of 99 participants, including healthy controls and preclinical subjects who were amyloid beta (Aβ) positive (n = 45), were recruited. We designed a mixed phonemic and semantic verbal fluency task for the experimental protocol. Functional connectivity was then analyzed as z-values in the left, right, and interhemispheric prefrontal regions during a verbal fluency task. Finally, we assessed the correlation between the participants' z-values and clinical indices.
RESULTS: The preclinical AD group exhibited increased interhemispheric functional connectivity derived from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during verbal tasks involving the first phonemic letter. Additionally, significant right and left functional connectivity differences were observed in the healthy control group during verbal tasks with the letter and categories, but not in the preclinical AD group. Lastly, the difference in interhemispheric functional connectivity of oxygenated hemoglobin between the first and second verbal trials was significantly greater in the preclinical AD group. These interhemispheric functional connectivity values were significantly correlated with Aβ results from positron emission tomography.
CONCLUSION: The initial increase and subsequent reduction of interhemispheric functional connectivity in the preclinical AD group across task repetitions suggests that task-related prefrontal network alterations may occur during the preclinical phase of AD and shows its potential as a biomarker for screening preclinical AD.",Front Aging Neurosci
40042520,Systematic review and meta-analysis of bulk RNAseq studies in human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue.,"UNLABELLED: We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies comparing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to controls in human brain tissue. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for human brain bulk RNAseq studies, excluding re-analyses and studies limited to small RNAs or gene panels. We developed 10 criteria for quality assessment and performed a meta-analysis on three high-quality datasets. Of 3266 records, 24 qualified for the systematic review, and one study with three datasets qualified for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis identified 571 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal lobe and 189 in the frontal lobe, including CLU and GFAP. Pathway analysis suggested reactivation of developmental processes in the adult AD brain. Limited data availability constrained the meta-analysis. These findings underscore the need for rigorous methods in AD transcriptomic research to better identify transcriptomic changes and advance biomarker and therapeutic development. This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023466522).
HIGHLIGHTS: Comprehensive review: Conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies comparing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with non-demented controls using primary human brain tissue.
KEY FINDINGS: Identified 571 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal lobe and 189 in the frontal lobe of patients with AD, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Pathway discovery: Highlighted key overlapping pathways such as ""tube morphogenesis"" and ""neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction"" that may play critical roles in AD.
QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Emphasized the importance of methodological rigor in transcriptomic studies, including quality assessment tools to guide future research in AD.

40008914,Independent associations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the independent associations between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
METHODS: Among 177,680 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who completed a survey on health risks, we residualized TGs and HDL-C conditional on age, sex, and body mass index. We included these residuals individually and concurrently in Cox models predicting ADRD incidence.
RESULTS: Low (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.10) and high quintiles (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.12) of HDL-C residuals were associated with an increased risk of ADRD compared to the middle quintile. Additional adjustment for TGs attenuated the association with high HDL-C (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08). Low TG residuals were associated with an increased ADRD risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.15); high TG residuals were protective (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). These estimates were unaffected by HDL-C adjustment.
DISCUSSION: Low HDL-C and TG levels are independently associated with increased ADRD risk. The correlation with low TG level explains the association of high HDL-C with ADRD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Strong correlations between lipid levels are important considerations when investigating lipids as late-life risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) were independently associated with an increased risk of ADRD. We found no evidence for an association between high HDL-C and increased ADRD risk after adjustment for TGs. High levels of TGs were consistently associated with a decreased risk of ADRD. There may be interaction between TG and HDL-C levels, where both low HDL-C and TG levels increase the risk of ADRD compared to average levels of both.",Alzheimers Dement
40071377,Impact of 16S rRNA on Intestinal Flora Alterations and Early Diagnosis in Early Alzheimer's Disease Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a complex clinical condition, relies on neuropsychological assessments for early diagnosis. Recently, the gut-brain axis has been recognized as crucial in AD development, with dysbiosis in gut microbiota implicated in disease progression. Utilizing 16S rRNA analysis provides comprehensive monitoring of gut microbiota, potentially revealing biological markers for Early Alzheimer's Disease (EAD). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the diagnostic impact of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) on changes in intestinal flora among EAD patients.
METHODS: This study analyzed stool samples from 50 AD patients and 50 healthy controls between June 2022 and June 2023. Based on the disease stage, patients were categorized into EAD (n = 14) and Late Alzheimer's Disease (LAD) groups (n = 36). The V3-V4 region was sequenced using 16S rRNA quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to compare the composition of gut microbiota and differences in abundance among the three experimental groups.
RESULTS: The abundance and diversity of gut microbiota significantly increased in EAD patients compared to the healthy control group. Furthermore, 39 genera showed considerable variations between EAD and LAD patients and healthy controls, with notable increases in the abundance of Bryantella, Gemmiger, Desulfovibrio, Collinsella, and Odoribacter among EAD patients. Additionally, significant differences were observed across the Desulfovibrioales and Verrucomicrobiales, which could help distinguish EAD patients (Area Under the Curve (AUC) range 0.854, 0.966, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA technology can be used to identify EAD patients, with the Desulfovibrioales and Verrucomicrobiales indicators serving as potential biological markers.",Actas Esp Psiquiatr
40133765,Generalizability of tau and amyloid plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease cohorts of diverse genetic ancestries.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated threonine 181 of tau (pTau181) and amyloid beta (Aβ) are biomarkers for differential diagnosis and preclinical detection of Alzheimer disease (AD). Given differences in AD risk across diverse populations, the generalizability of existing biomarker data is not assured.
METHODS: In 2086 individuals of diverse genetic ancestries (African American, Caribbean Hispanic, and Peruvian), we measured plasma pTau181 and Aβ42/Aβ40. Differences in biomarkers between cohorts and clinical diagnosis groups and the potential discriminative performance of the two biomarkers were assessed.
RESULTS: pTau181 and Aβ42/Aβ40 were consistent across cohorts. Higher levels of pTau181 were associated with AD, while Aβ42/Aβ40 had minimal differences. Correspondingly, pTau181 had a greater predictive value than Aβ42/Aβ40; however, the area under the curve differed between cohorts.
DISCUSSION: pTau181 as a plasma biomarker for clinical AD is generalizable across genetic ancestries, but its predictive value may vary. Combining genomic and biomarker data from diverse individuals will increase understanding of genetic risk and refine clinical diagnoses.
HIGHLIGHTS: This is a diverse ancestry study of plasma biomarkers for AD. Plasma biomarkers were assessed in African Americans, Caribbean Hispanics, and Peruvians. Biomarker levels were consistent across the diverse cohorts. Plasma phosphorylated tau was higher in AD in all cohorts. Plasma biomarker findings in diverse cohorts largely generalize with existing European studies.",Alzheimers Dement
40010674,Neurofibrillary tangles predict dementia in patients with carotid stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: There is growing appreciation that extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease (ECAD) is associated with increased dementia risk. Despite this, clinical management of ECAD does not involve evaluation for cognitive outcomes or risk stratification for dementia. One impediment to studying and improving clinical care for this cohort (roughly 10% of adults aged >60 years) is that factors to identify patients with ECAD at risk for dementia are not known.
METHODS: Our prospective clinicopathologic study, the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders study, evaluated clinical and histopathologic factors for dementia in subjects with ECAD. The primary outcome (dementia) was defined as a composite of Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia based on a clinical/neuropathologic diagnosis. Of 1234 subjects, those with dementia other than Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia were excluded; there remained 111 subjects with ECAD to be evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of key risk factors for dementia including age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genetic status, and dementia biomarkers. A precision recall curve was also generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of dementia prediction models.
RESULTS: Individuals with dementia compared with those without had significantly increased levels of stroke, ApoE4 genotype, and dementia biomarkers, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and amyloid plaques. Models of multiple combined risk factors were little or no better than NFTs alone, which showed a 96.9% positive predictive value at an NFT threshold of 10.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we hypothesized that a combination of clinical and histopathologic biomarkers would result in the strongest predictive model for dementia, we found that NFTs alone had the highest association and positive predictive value for dementia risk in patients with ECAD. As blood-based assays for NFT quantification become more clinically reliable and available, these data support the possibility that NFT quantification may help identify patients with ECAD at increased risk for dementia.",J Vasc Surg
40081504,Decreased brain interstitial fluid dynamics is associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline.,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion-tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index that has the potential to reflect brain interstitial fluid (ISF) dynamics may predict the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We aimed to study whether brain ISF dynamics indicated by the ALPS index relate to AD dementia diagnosis and AD-related changes.
METHODS: This study included a discovery cohort (n = 180) and a validation cohort (n = 127), which were composed of cognitively normal, subjective memory concern, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia subjects. All participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging examination and neuropsychological evaluation. The diffusivities and diffusion-tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) were calculated. The support vector machine (SVM) model for AD dementia diagnosis was built in the discovery cohort and validated in the validation cohort. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between the ALPS and cognitive decline. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between the ALPS and the risk of AD dementia.
RESULTS: There was a lower median ALPS index in the AD dementia group compared to other groups (all P < 0.05) for both cohorts. The SVM model for AD dementia diagnosis produced an AUC of 0.802 in the discovery cohort (P < 0.001) and 0.783 in the external validation cohort (P < 0.001). Higher ALPS levels were associated with less cognitive decline (P < 0.001). Moreover, lower baseline ALPS had a greater risk of converting to AD dementia (P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: The SVM model based on diffusivities and ALPS was effective for AD dementia diagnosis, and higher ALPS levels are associated with a lower risk of AD-related changes. These findings suggest that ALPS may provide a useful AD progression or treatment biomarker.",Brain Res Bull
40105289,"Global, Regional, and National Burden of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias in Young Adults Aged 40-64 Years, 1990-2021: A Population-Based Study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (EOAD) impose significant burdens on affected individuals and their families. However, the global burden of EOAD has not been fully investigated. We aimed to assess the global, regional, and national burden of EOAD using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) study from 1990 to 2021.
METHODS: Data for adults aged 40-64 were extracted within the GBD 2021 framework. Primary outcomes included age-standardized prevalence, incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for EOAD, as well as average annual percentage change (AAPC) across 21 regions and 204 countries.
RESULTS: In 2021, EOAD cases reached 7.75 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5.82-10.08), up from 3.67 million cases (95% UI 2.75-4.76) in 1990. The age-standardized prevalence rate increased from 341.2 per 100,000 (95% UI 255.89-442.79) in 1990 to 363.5 per 100,000 in 2021, with an AAPC of 0.26% (p < 0.001). EOAD prevalence was higher in women than in men in 2021 (4.28 million, 95% UI 3.24-5.56, vs. 3.46 million, 95% UI 2.57-4.52). EOAD was associated with 0.07 million (95% UI 0.01-0.23) deaths and 3.77 million (95% UI 1.69-8.88) DALYs in 2021. Additionally, 1.06 million (95% UI 0.07-3.03) DALYs were attributable to smoking, elevated fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: The global number of EOAD cases among adults aged 40-64 years more than doubled from 1990 to 2021. Targeted strategies and interventions are urgently needed to address this growing public health issue.",Eur J Neurol
39985404,SCD-plus features and AD biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired samples: A meta-analytic approach for nine cohort studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Specific features of subjective cognitive decline (SCD-plus) have been proposed to indicate an increased risk of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies have examined how these features relate to AD biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults.
METHODS: Meta-analyses were performed using cross-sectional data from nine cohorts (n = 7219, mean age (SD): 71.17 (5.9), 56.5% female) to determine associations of SCD-plus features with positron emission tomography (PET)- or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau biomarkers.
RESULTS: Participants with preclinical AD (community-based only) were more likely to fulfill SCD-plus features. The presence of self-reported memory decline, associated concern/worry, and a higher number of fulfilled features were all associated with high Aβ levels. Only the latter was associated with abnormal tau.
DISCUSSION: Simultaneous endorsement of multiple SCD-plus features is a robust indicator of abnormal AD biomarkers in CU older adults, whereas isolated SCD features seem only sensitive to elevated Aβ, supporting their value as early behavioral markers of preclinical AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: About two-tenths of our sample had abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels with evidence of subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Preclinical AD subsamples (community-based) had a higher percentage of participants meeting SCD-plus features. Self-reported memory decline and concern/worry were the sole features associated with high Aβ, but not tau, burden. A higher number of fulfilled SCD-plus features are linked to high Aβ and tau burden. Use of multiple SCD-plus features may help identify early stages of biological AD.",Alzheimers Dement
40044591,Diagnostic Challenge in Frontal Variant Alzheimer's Disease With Low Amyloid-β PET Retention.,"Diagnosing frontal variant Alzheimer's disease (fvAD) is difficult and could be even more difficult when amyloid-beta (Aβ) PET retention is low. A 63-year-old woman presenting with a 3-year history of apathy and memory impairment showed executive dysfunction, memory impairment, and severe bilateral frontotemporal atrophy on MRI. Aβ PET showed only equivocal findings in the right frontal lobe and was negative. However, CSF showed a severely decreased Aβ42/40 ratio and increased phospho-tau181. AD-tau-specific (18F)-MK6240 PET revealed increased tracer retention predominantly in the bilateral frontal lobes, confirming the fvAD diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and physicians' satisfaction of Rivast<sup>®</sup> (rivastigmine oral solution 2 mg/ml) in Taiwanese patients with mild to moderate AD over a 52-week period.
METHODS: An open-label, non-comparative, observational study was conducted across four hospitals in Taiwan. 142 Patients with mild to moderate AD were enrolled. Adverse events and adherence rates were monitored throughout the 52-week study period, while cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) and global functional outcomes (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-Sum of Boxes) were recorded at baseline and at week 52. Factors associated with discontinuation, adverse events, and declines in cognitive and global function were determined.
RESULTS: The study achieved a 92.3% adherence rate, with 19% experiencing adverse events. The optimal dose was 3.8 ml, reached within 8.3 weeks. 43.7% of the patients reached an optimal dose of 4 ml and 59.8% achieved optimal dose within 4 weeks. Age and clinically significant electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities were associated with a higher risk of discontinuation, while female patients exhibited a lower risk. Additionally, both a higher initial dose and a higher optimal dose were associated with a reduced risk of adverse effects. Abnormal EKG findings were significantly associated with cognitive decline. More time to optimal dose was significantly associated with worse global function. All physicians regarded the medication is ease of use and the administration schedule is simple.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the tolerability and efficacy of rivastigmine oral solution in Taiwanese patients with mild to moderate AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40100088,Prevalence and factors associated with seizures among patients with dementia: A retrospective clinic-based study.,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic diseases associated with aging, such as dementia and seizures, are expected to rise significantly in the Philippines' growing elderly population. This study aims to determine the frequency, demographic characteristics, and clinical profile of dementia patients who developed new-onset seizures in an outpatient setting.
METHODS: This descriptive, retrospective, cumulative prevalence study included 245 patients diagnosed with dementia at a tertiary hospital in Manila from February 2010 to February 2020, according to DSM-5 criteria. Patients were stratified into those who developed seizures and those who did not. Data on demographics, type, dementia severity, comorbidities, and seizure characteristics were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The study included 245 dementia patients, of whom 10 (4.1%) developed seizures, with a higher likelihood observed in those with severe dementia. Most patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and seizures were mostly seen in individuals between the ages of 65 and 79. The majority of the seizures were classified as generalized (50%). Compared to mild cases, patients with moderate dementia are about 1.5 times more likely to experience seizures, whereas patients with severe dementia are about 10 times more likely to experience seizures compared to patients with mild dementia. The association is statistically significant for severe cases of dementia.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed that 4.1% of Filipino patients diagnosed with dementia in an outpatient setting at a tertiary hospital developed new-onset seizures. Seizures were mostly reported in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. Conventional understanding of seizures among patients with dementia is important to identify features and predictors to provide efficient management among these patients to possibly improve their quality of life.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: With the aging Filipino population, there is an expected rise in chronic diseases such as dementia and seizures. This study looked at dementia patients in an outpatient setting over 10 years and found that 4.1% developed seizures. Most patients had Alzheimer's disease, and seizures were more common in severe dementia cases.",Epilepsia Open

40109463,[Research Progress in the Mechanisms of Acupuncture in Regulating DNA Methylation].,"DNA methylation is the first epigenetic modification found in humans. Abnormal changes in DNA methylation are closely associated with the development and progression of diseases. Acupuncture, an important component of traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to have significant therapeutic efficacy. The mechanisms underlying acupuncture are complex, involving physiological and pathological processes of integrated interactions across multiple targets. However, current research mostly focuses on a single target, highlighting the need for a more upstream approach to the investigation of the mechanisms. Herein, we reviewed studies on the direct or indirect regulation of DNA methylation via acupuncture. We also discussed its mechanisms of action in pain, obesity, depression, and Alzheimer disease, in order to provide a new perspective on the therapeutic mechanisms of acupuncture and the role of DNA methylation in the field of acupuncture research. Future research should concentrate on the effect of acupuncture on the DNA methylation of specific genes, the quantification of changes in DNA methylation at different acupoints, the development of individualized acupuncture prescriptions, further investigation of the specificity of the effects at different acupoint, and the expansion of the research to integrate epigenetics and genomics.

40046641,Is late-life vulnerability to cardiovascular disease risk associated with longitudinal tau accumulation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment?,"BACKGROUND: Older females have higher Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk and tau burden, especially in early disease stages, compared to males. Overlapping cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia risk factors, like the apolipoprotein (APOE)-ε4 allele, show mixed sex-specific results. We previously found that late-life CVD risk related more strongly to tau at a single timepoint in cognitively normal, older female APOE-ε4 carriers than in males.
OBJECTIVES: Do composite and component CVD risk factors explain sex differences in tau accumulation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and underlying amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology?
DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
SETTING: ADNI is a multi-site longitudinal study across the United States and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: n = 52 older adults (aged 60-90), designated as both Aβ-positive and MCI.
MEASUREMENTS: CVD risk was measured by body mass index (BMI) and FRS, which includes age, systolic blood pressure (BP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol, hypertension treatment, smoking, and diabetes. Regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were extracted at each tau-PET timepoint. Composite SUVRs for Braak34 and Braak56 were calculated. Statistical models examined the separate and interactive effects of sex and APOE-ε4 on tau accumulation, and moderating effects of FRS, its components, or BMI, on tau accumulation.
RESULTS: Females accumulated more tau than males in bilateral Braak34 and right Braak56, while APOE-ε4 carriers trended toward more tau accumulation in left Braak56. FRS and its components did not relate to tau accumulation, nor influence sex effects, although they attenuated APOE-ε4 effects. In left Braak56, higher baseline BMI in males showed a trend toward greater tau accumulation.
CONCLUSIONS: In MCI and Aβ-positive older adults, females accumulated more tau than males, and late-life vascular risk did not explain this relationship. Higher BMI related to more tau accumulation in males only, suggesting sex-specific vulnerability to BMI on brain health. Although replication in larger and more representative cohorts is needed, these findings corroborate accelerated tau progression in older females, independent of CVD risk, and suggest that vascular health has limited influence on tau progression once AD pathology is established in the brain.",JAR Life
40114475,The relation of implicit age bias based on negative age stereotypes to the American state prevalence of older adult Alzheimer's disease.,"This study determined the relation of Implicit Age Bias among respondents aged 20-59 years of age to the 2020 Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence among residents 65 years and over with the 48 contiguous American states as analytic units. This implicit measure of state ambient ageism correlated .69 with state AD prevalence and persisted in multiple regression equations considering several controls including older adult poverty rate, high school graduation, bachelor's degree attainment, and multiple chronic conditions. Based on stereotype embodiment theory, the assumption is that the influence of external state-level age bias combined with the personal experiences of state residents leads to the general internalization of negative age stereotypes and ultimately to higher state AD prevalence. The speculation is that such internalization at the individual level leads to adoption of unhealthy behaviors and stress accumulation that eventually produces immunological deficiencies, infections, and inflammation conducive to AD onset and progression.",J Soc Psychol
40006958,Viruses and the Brain-A Relationship Prone to Trouble.,"Neurological disorders, some of which are associated with viral infections, are growing due to the aging and expanding population. Despite strong defenses of the central nervous system, some viruses have evolved ways to breach them, which often result in dire consequences. In this review, we recount the various ways by which different viruses can enter the CNS, and we describe the consequences of such invasions. Consequences may manifest as acute disease, such as encephalitis, meningitis, or result in long-term effects, such as neuromuscular dysfunction, as occurs in poliomyelitis. We discuss evidence for viral involvement in the causation of well-known chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, as well as vascular dementia in the elderly. We also describe the approaches currently available to control a few of the neural viral infections. These include antivirals that are effective against human immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus, as well as vaccines valuable for controlling rabies virus, poliomyelitis virus, and some flavivirus infections. There is an urgent need to better understand, at a molecular level, how viruses contribute to acute and, especially, chronic neurological diseases and to develop more precise and effective vaccines and therapies.",Viruses
40057581,"Longitudinal trajectories of cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric decline in Alzheimer's disease during COVID-19 lockdown in South Korea.","The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its interaction with COVID-19-induced social isolation remains poorly understood. This study investigated the longitudinal trajectories of AD severity on cognitive function, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and examined the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on AD patients in South Korea. In this retrospective longitudinal study, data from 253 adults (aged ≥ 55) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD were analyzed, collected between 2018 and 2022. Participants were classified into four groups based on clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores: MCI, AD-CDR0.5, AD-CDR1, and AD-CDR2. Cognitive function, functional abilities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms, and overall dementia severity were assessed. Linear mixed-effects models, along with mediation and moderation analyses were employed to analyze the data. Significant trajectories of decline in cognitive function and functional abilities were observed over time, with more pronounced declines in higher AD severity groups. The COVID-19 lockdown exacerbated cognitive decline and impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) specifically in the most severe AD group (AD-CDR2). Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) mediated the relationship between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) in the MCI, AD-CDR0.5, and AD-CDR1 groups. A significant interaction between MMSE scores and neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed in the moderate AD group (AD-CDR1), indicating that worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms intensified cognitive decline. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores increased over time, indicating worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas depressive symptoms, measured by the short geriatric depression scale (SGDS), remained stable over the study period. This study highlights the impact of AD severity on cognitive and functional decline, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown. The mediating role of IADL suggests that maintaining complex daily activities may be crucial in slowing disease progression in AD patients. Additionally, the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms underscores the need for targeted mental health support, especially during periods of social isolation, to mitigate adverse effects on patients and caregivers.",Sci Rep
40034359,The association between activities and cognitive health: Stratified analysis by APOE ε4 status.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the growing evidence on the modifiable and genetic factors associated with cognitive health, little is known about the role of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene ε4 allele in the associations between productive or leisure activities and cognitive health.
OBJECTIVE: This study fills a gap of knowledge by examining the associations among employment, civic engagement, and leisure activities and cognitive health by the presence of APOE ε4 allele, an established risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Using pooled data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Psychosocial and Lifestyle Questionnaires (2010-2016) and the HRS data on APOE ε4 alleles, linear regression models with a lagged dependent variable were performed to examine associations between productive or leisure activities and cognitive functioning at the follow-up time point, as well as the role of APOE ε4 in these associations.
RESULTS: Among all participants, employment, low or high-intensity volunteering, and cognitive/social leisure activities were associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning. The presence of at least one ε4 allele was related to poorer cognitive functioning at the follow-up time point. Among people without the APOE ε4 allele, employment, high-intensity volunteering, and cognitive/social leisure activities were significantly associated with cognitive functioning. Among people with at least one APOE ε4 allele, low-intensity volunteering and cognitive/physical leisure activities were significantly associated with better cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that employment, civic engagement, and leisure activities all contribute to cognitive health, although the benefits may be restricted to low-intensity volunteering and cognitive/physical leisure activities among individuals with at least one APOE ε4 allele, who are known to be inherently at a greater risk of AD, highlighting an avenue to a relatively easily implementable strategy to promote cognitive health in this subpopulation.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40026419,Stools from a human APOEe2 donor reduces amyloid and tau pathology and increases neuroinflammation in a 3xTg AD mouse model.,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of the e2 variant of the APOE gene (APOEe2) against Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been elucidated. We altered the microbiota of 3xTgAD mice by fecal microbiota transplantation from a human APOEe2 donor (e2-FMT) and tested the effect of microbiota perturbations on brain AD pathology.
METHODS: FMT of bacteria isolated from stools of untreated 3xTgAD mice (M-FMT) or e2-FMT were transplanted in 15-month-old 3xTgAD mice. FMT was done alone or in combination with antibiotic and proton-pump inhibitor following the Microbiota Transfer Therapy protocol (MTT). The effect of donor (M or e2) and transplantation protocol (FMT or MTT) on hippocampal amyloid, tau pathology and neuroinflammation were assessed at the end of the treatment.
RESULTS: e2-FMT reduced amyloid, and tau pathology as well as increased neuroinflammation as compared with M-FMT. MTT was associated with reduced number of Aβ40+ plaques and tau pathology. Low levels of amyloid were associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in e2-FMT mice. These associations were partially attenuated by MTT.
CONCLUSION: Bacteria from a human APOEe2 donor reduced AD pathology and increased neuroinflammation in mice suggesting that the gut microbiota may be a mediator of the protective effect of APOEe2.",Front Aging Neurosci
40055645,Network pharmacology mechanism of Rosmarinus officinalis L.(Rosemary) to improve cell viability and reduces apoptosis in treating Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, nerve loss, neurofibrillary tangles and Aβ plaques. Different process of the AD pathology present more opportunities for treatment. In addition, the holistic approaches involving network pharmacology with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may be viable options for AD treatment, and lead to an effective cure for AD in the future. Therefore, this study explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Rosmarinus officinalis L(rosemary) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease on basis of cell experiments, network pharmacology and molecular docking.
METHODS: We performed cell experiments, to investigate the therapeutic effects of Rosmarinus officinalis L on AD in vitro using CCK8 assay, flow cytometry and TMRE Kit. In addition, carnosic acid is a major antioxidant diterpenoid in Rosmarinus officinalis L. We performed cell experiments, to investigate the neuroprotective effects of carnosic acid on AD in virto using CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the main antioxidant compounds of rosemary ware collected through literature reviews, PharmMapper and Swiss Target prediction ware used to identify their potential targets. Targets of AD were obtained from Genecards and OMIM. The intersection targets of the main active components of rosemary and the therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease were subsequently obtained by using online Venn diagram. Protein-protein interaction, Cytoscape, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes were used to analyze potential targets and key pathways of rosemary in AD. Besides, through molecular docking, the interactions of the main active components of rosemary, and the predicted candidate targets were verified. Finally, quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to confirm the effectiveness of the genes.
RESULTS: It was found that rosemary could reversed Aβ25-35 induced damage to mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells, significantly improved the viability of damaged cells, and reduced apoptosis. The results of fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33,342 and TMRE suggested that rosemary inhibited the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential levels induced by Aβ25-35, which had a specific protective effect on AD in vitro. Additionally, a main antioxidant compound in rosemary, carnosic acid, also has neuroprotective effects. Eight main antioxidant compounds of rosemary ware collected. Network pharmacology and molecular docking, revealed that rosemary plays a therapeutic role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through the main active carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmarinol, rosmadial, genkwanin, cirsimaritin, rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid in Rosmarinus officinalis L, which affects the gene regulation of HRAS, ESR1, RHOA, IGF1, SRC, ANXA5, MMP9, MAPK14, NOS3, and PIK3R1, and participates in the PI3K-Akt, Rap1, MAPK, and estrogen signaling pathways. RT-qPCR indicated that rosemary could elevated expression of IGF1, MMP9 and decreased mRNA levels of SRC, MAPK14, compared with the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Rosemary is an important economic plant with multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway synergistic effects.The findings highlight the effectiveness of rosemary in helping to increase cell viability and reduce apoptosis when treating mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells, thereby supporting its therapeutic potential in treating Alzheimer's disease.",BMC Complement Med Ther
40053723,Understanding Challenges and Emotions of Informal Caregivers of General Older Adults and People With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementia: Comparative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Faced with multiple challenges, informal caregivers often turn to online support communities for information and support. While scholarly attention has focused on experiences expressed by informal caregivers in these communities, how caregivers' challenges and emotional expressions vary across different health contexts remains understudied.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine and compare the challenges discussed by informal caregivers of general older adults and those of patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, as well as their emotional expressions, on Reddit. In addition, we examined how informal caregivers expressed their emotions in response to various challenges.
METHODS: We collected posts from 6 subreddits, including 3 subreddits on caregiving for older adults and 3 on caregiving for patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia. Using topic modeling, we identified topics discussed by caregivers in the collected posts. We further used deep reading to contextualize these topics and understand the challenges behind them, conducted sentiment analysis to investigate their emotional expressions, and used Spearman rank-order correlation to examine the relationship between the obtained topics and emotions.
RESULTS: In total, 3028 posts were retrieved, including 1552 from older adult-related subreddits and 1476 from Alzheimer disease-related subreddits; 18 key topics were identified, with the most frequent topics being expressing feelings (2178/3028, 71.93%) and seeking advice and support (1982/3028, 65.46%). Other topics covered various challenges in caregiving, such as duration of medical care (1954/3028, 64.53%), sleep and incontinence (1536/3028, 50.73%), financial issues (1348/3028, 44.52%), and nursing home (1221/3028, 40.32%). There was a positive, negligible correlation between expressing feelings and seeking advice and support (ρ=0.09, P<.001). Other topics also showed positive, negligible or weak correlations with these 2 topics but in distinct patterns. Posts from older adult-related subreddits were more focused on practical caregiving issues and seeking advice and support, whereas posts from Alzheimer disease-related subreddits emphasized health- and medical-related topics and expressing feelings. Caregivers in both contexts predominantly expressed negative emotions (older adults: 1263/1552, 81.38%; Alzheimer disease: 1247/1476, 84.49%), with caregivers in Alzheimer disease-related subreddits exhibiting slightly greater fear and sadness (P<.001). Specific challenges were significantly correlated with negative emotions: duration of medicalcare was positively, weakly correlated with anger (ρ=0.25, P<.001), fear (ρ=0.25, P<.001), and sadness (ρ=0.22, P<.001). Medical appointments were positively, negligibly correlated with anger (ρ=0.10, P<.001), fear (ρ=0.09, P<.001), and sadness (ρ=0.06, P<.001). Sleep and incontinence (ρ=0.14, P<.001) and finances (ρ=0.24, P<.001) were positively, weakly correlated with anger.
CONCLUSIONS: By identifying the challenges and feelings expressed by caregivers for general older adults and caregivers for patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, our findings could inform health practitioners and policy makers in developing more targeted support interventions for informal caregivers in different contexts.",J Med Internet Res
40073950,Role of mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease: Rouge of brain kinases.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the chief cause of dementia and related mortality worldwide due to progressive accumulation of amyloid peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These neuropathological changes lead to cognitive impairment and memory dysfunction. Notably, most Food drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-AD medications such as tacrine and donepezil are engaged with symptomatic relief of cognitive impairment but do not reverse the underlying AD neuropathology. Therefore, searching for new anti-AD is advisable. It has been shown that the inflammatory signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are intricate with the Aβ and tau protein neuropathology in AD. In addition, inhibition of brain MAPK plays a critical role in mitigating cognitive dysfunction in early-onset AD. Though, the fundamental mechanisms for the beneficial effects of MAPK inhibitors were not fully explained. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the potential molecular mechanisms of MAPK inhibitors in AD.",Brain Res Bull
40046342,Biological signatures in the Alzheimer's continuum discriminate between diagnosis-related and -unrelated associations to ATN categories.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias have a multifactorial aetiology and heterogeneous biology. The current study aims to identify different biological signatures in a deeply phenotyped memory clinic patient population. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed 49 pre-specified proteins using a multiplex antibody-based suspension bead array in 278 CSF samples from the real-world research database and biobank at the Karolinska University Hospital Memory Clinic, Solna, Sweden. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of subjective cognitive decline (N = 151), mild cognitive impairment (N = 61), Alzheimer's disease (N = 47), or other diagnoses (N = 19; vascular dementias, alcohol-related dementia, unspecified dementias, or other amnesias) were included. Principal component analyses were performed, and resulting principal components (PCs) were tested for associations with clinical variables and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (CSF biomarkers beta-amyloid 42, beta-amyloid 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181, phosphorylated tau 181/beta-amyloid 42). PC 1 (explaining 52% of the variance between patients) was associated with the clinical Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers beta-amyloid 42, phosphorylated tau 181, and total tau but not with Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration imaging markers, cognitive performance, or clinical diagnosis. PC 2 (explaining 9% of the variance) displayed an inflammatory profile with high contributions of chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and significant correlation to CSF free light chain kappa. In contrast to PC 1, PC 3 (explaining 5% of the variance) showed associations with all the clinical Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers, the imaging markers, cognitive impairment and clinical diagnosis. Serpin family A member 3 (SERPINA3), chitinase 1 (CHIT1), and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) contributed most to PC 3. PC 4 (explaining 4% of the variance) exhibited an inflammatory profile distinct from PC 2, with the largest contributions from TREM2, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) and complement C9. The component was associated with peripheral inflammation. We found that CSF protein profiles in a memory clinic cohort reflect molecular differences across diagnostic groups. Our results emphasize that real-world memory clinic patients can have different ongoing biological processes despite receiving the same diagnosis. In the future, this information could be utilized to identify patient endotypes and uncover precision biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.",Brain Commun

While investigations of specific mechanistic aspects of diseases have been aided by cell and animal models, true advances in the understanding of neurodegeneration require that we deal with the daunting complexities of the human brain. In this review, we discuss novel molecular profiling methods that have been applied to human postmortem brain tissue during the last decade and highlight insights into cell type-specific molecular characteristics and disease-associated changes in both vulnerable and resilient cell types in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. We also illustrate how these approaches can complement human genetic analyses and studies of animal models to advance our understanding of human neurodegeneration.",Annu Rev Neurosci
40141679,Sex-Specific Adaptations in Alzheimer's Disease and Ischemic Stroke: A Longitudinal Study in Male and Female APP<sub>swe</sub>/PS1<sub>dE9</sub> Mice.,"The long-term impact of stroke on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, particularly regarding sex-specific differences, remains unknown. Using a longitudinal study design, we investigated transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in 3.5-month-old APP<sub>swe</sub>/PS1<sub>dE9</sub> (APP/PS1) and wild-type mice. In vivo, we assessed behavior, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and structural integrity by neuroimaging, as well as post-mortem myelin integrity (polarized light imaging, PLI), neuroinflammation, and amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. APP/PS1 mice exhibited cognitive decline, white matter degeneration (reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)), and decreased myelin density via PLI. Despite early hypertension, APP/PS1 mice showed only sporadic hypoperfusion. Cortical thickening and hippocampal hypertrophy likely resulted from Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation. Stroke-operated mice retained cognition despite cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy due to cerebrovascular adaptation, including increased CBF in the hippocampus and thalamus. Stroke did not worsen AD pathology, nor did AD exacerbate stroke outcomes. Sex differences were found: female APP/PS1 mice had more severe Aβ deposition, hyperactivity, lower body weight, and reduced CBF but less neuroinflammation, suggesting potential neuroprotection. These findings highlight white matter degeneration and Aβ pathology as key drivers of cognitive decline in AD, with stroke-related deficits mitigated by (cerebro)vascular adaptation. Sex-specific therapies are crucial for AD and stroke.",Life (Basel)
40012390,Biochanin-A: A Potential Candidate for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a multifactorial neurological condition characterized by progressive loss of memory and learning, uncontrollable movement, difficulty processing visual images, and impairment of reasoning and/or judgment skills. Although the exact cause of AD is still unknown, recent evidence suggests that environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors are common contributors to the disease's progression. Pathophysiological features of AD include amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, abnormal deposition of neuritic plaques and neurofibrile tangles, cholinergic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress burden along with mitochondrial dysfunction. There are currently no pharmaceutical methods or medications that can stop the progression of a disease. More attention is now being paid to natural products, herbal medicines, and different bioactive phytoconstituents, particularly flavonoids, as alternative therapies and useful resources for finding new drug candidates for the treatment of AD-like symptoms. A dietary isoflavone, biochanin-A, which is isolated from the leaves and stems of Trifolium pretense L. (family: Leguminosae), possesses remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties along with cognitive-enhancing effects. Biochanin-A exhibits notable neuroprotective effects by reducing Aβ deposition, decreasing apoptosis, and preventing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL- 1β, and NO. Various preclinical reports explore the pharmacological role of biochanin-A against experimentally-induced AD and highlight that it can alter numerous signaling pathways, including Nrf2, NF-κB, JNK, MAPK, and Bcl-2/Bax. The present review article summarizes the numerous research studies that have evaluated the role of biochanin-A for dementia associated with AD. As part of a comprehensive program, biochanin-A has very exceptional potential to prevent and treat AD-related cognitive impairment. It is envisaged that these potential chemical moieties can be employed in the drug discovery process to identify efficacious and safe therapy for the treatments for AD-like manifestation.",Curr Pharm Biotechnol
40013092,"Quantification and correlation of amyloid-β plaque load, glial activation, GABAergic interneuron numbers, and cognitive decline in the young TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are essential tools for investigating disease pathophysiology and conducting preclinical drug testing. In this study, we examined neuronal and glial alterations in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of young TgF344-AD rats and correlated these changes with cognitive decline and amyloid-β plaque load.
METHODS: We compared TgF344-AD and non-transgenic littermate rats aged 7-8 months of age. We systematically quantified β-amyloid plaques, astrocytes, microglia, four different subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (calretinin-, cholecystokinin-, parvalbumin-, and somatostatin-positive neurons), and newly generated neurons in the hippocampus. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Barnes maze test.
RESULTS: Young TgF344-AD rats had a large number of amyloid plaques in both the hippocampus and mPFC, together with a pronounced increase in microglial cell numbers. Astrocytic activation was significant in the mPFC. Cholecystokinin-positive cell numbers were decreased in the hippocampus of transgenic rats, but calretinin-, parvalbumin-, and somatostatin-positive cell numbers were not altered. Adult neurogenesis was not affected by genotype. TgF344-AD rats had spatial learning and memory impairments, but this cognitive deficit did not correlate with amyloid plaque number or cellular changes in the brain. In the hippocampus, amyloid plaque numbers were negatively correlated with cholecystokinin-positive neuron and microglial cell numbers. In the mPFC, amyloid plaque number was negatively correlated with the number of astrocytes.
CONCLUSION: Pronounced neuropathological changes were found in the hippocampus and mPFC of young TgF344-AD rats, including the loss of hippocampal cholecystokinin-positive interneurons. Some of these neuropathological changes were negatively correlated with amyloid-β plaque load, but not with cognitive impairment.",Front Aging Neurosci

We also illustrate how advanced human models that better mimic brain physiology and AD pathology are providing unprecedented insights into the multifaceted roles of microglia. These innovative approaches, combined with sophisticated technologies for cell editing and analysis, are shaping AD research and opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting microglia.",Trends Immunol
40095120,Multi-Omics Analysis of Hippocampus in Rats Administered Trimethyltin Chloride.,"Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is a neurotoxicant that damages the central nervous system (CNS) and triggers neurodegeneration. This study used multi-omic data, including transcriptomics and proteomics of the rat hippocampus, to identify differentially expressed genes and proteins in TMT-induced neurotoxicity over time, related to neuro-axonal damage marked by plasma Neurofilament Light (NfL) levels. Data were collected at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h post-TMT administration. NfL levels surged at 72 and 168 h, confirming neuro-axonal damage. Transcripts of genes in the chemokine signaling pathway (Cxcl10, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Cxcl16), apoptosis pathway (Caspase-3, PARP1, CTSD), and TNF signaling pathway (TNFR1, MMP9, ICAM-1, TRAF3) showed significant differential expression starting from 48 h, preceding the NfL increase, suggesting their roles in neuro-axonal damage. Additionally, 11 Alzheimer's disease-related proteins, with significant changes from 72 to 168 h, were detected only in the proteomic dataset, indicating post-translational modifications might be crucial in neurotoxicity. Pathway analysis revealed that neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease pathways were among the top 15 affected by TMT-induced gene regulation, aligning with the involvement of TNF signaling, apoptosis, and chemokine signaling in neurodegeneration. This research highlighted the value of longitudinal omics studies, combined with pathway enrichment, gene-disease association, and neuro-axonal damage biomarker analyses, to elucidate neurotoxicant-induced neurodegeneration. Findings from this study could enhance the understanding of TMT-induced neurotoxicity, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies and preventive measures.",Neurotox Res

The factors investigated by the authors of this review are discussed in more detail, including posttranslational modifications (glycation and S-nitrosylation), cinnamic acid derivatives and dendrimers, and chaperonins (eukaryotic, bacterial, and phage). A special section is devoted to the role of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of amyloid neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, its involvement in the transformation of infectious prions and possibly other proteins capable of prion-like transmission of amyloidogenic diseases.",Biochemistry (Mosc)
40028317,Porphyromonas gingivalis: a potential trigger of neurodegenerative disease.,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a gram-negative bacterium and the main causative agent of periodontitis, a disease closely associated with the development of periodontal disease. The progression of periodontitis, a chronic infectious disease, is intricately linked to the inflammatory immune response. Inflammatory cytokines act on periodontal tissues via immunomodulation, resulting in the destruction of the periodontal tissue. Recent studies have established connections between periodontitis and various systemic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are neurological disorders caused by immune system dysfunction, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. One of the main characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases is an impaired inflammatory response, which mediates neuroinflammation through microglial activation. Some studies have shown an association between periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases, with P. gingivalis as the primary culprit. P. gingivalis can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or mediate neuroinflammation and injury through a variety of pathways, including the gut-brain axis, thereby affecting neuronal growth and survival and participating in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. However, comprehensive and systematic summaries of studies on the infectious origin of neurodegenerative diseases are lacking. This article reviews and summarizes the relationship between P. gingivalis and neurodegenerative diseases and its possible regulatory mechanisms. This review offers new perspectives into the understanding of neurodegenerative disease development and highlights innovative approaches for investigating and developing tailored medications for treating neurodegenerative conditions, particularly from the viewpoint of their association with P. gingivalis.",Front Immunol
40108829,Accuracy of plasma biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy prior to dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteinopathy prior to the onset of dementia have significant implications for early detection.
METHODS: In 304 individuals without dementia, we investigated whether C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics' mass spectrometry (MS)-based plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta 42/40, %phosphorylated tau [p-tau]181, and %p-tau217) and amyloid probability scores (APS, PrecivityAD and APS2, PrecivityAD2) are associated with brain amyloid, brain tau, or preclinical cognitive decline.
RESULTS: In this cohort study, %p-tau217 and the APS2 had high discriminative accuracy (area under the curve > 0.93) for identifying elevated brain amyloid and tau and were associated with faster preclinical cognitive decline. Using %p-tau217 or the APS2 in a theoretical AD trial screening scenario reduced amyloid positron emission tomography imaging costs up to 41% or 45%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics' MS-based plasma biomarkers can detect brain amyloid and tau with high accuracy prior to dementia and could aid in identifying candidates for clinical trials or therapeutic intervention.
HIGHLIGHTS: C<sub>2</sub>N plasma biomarkers differentiated Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy status prior to dementia. Plasma %phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and the C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics PrecivityAD2 (APS2) were concordant with amyloid and tau positron emission tomography status.

40046847,Rodent islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) selectively enhances GABA <sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated neuronal inhibition in mouse ventral but not dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells.,"Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, amylin) is a peptide hormone that plays an important role in glucose homeostasis but has been implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. However, its effect on neurotransmission in the hippocampus remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of non-amyloidogenic rodent IAPP (rIAPP) on GABA <sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated neuronal inhibition in mouse dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we showed that rIAPP selectively enhanced both GABA-activated spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) in ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampal DG granule cells. The effect of rIAPP on sIPSCs was completely abolished in the presence of the amylin receptor antagonist IAPP<sub>8-37</sub>. Interestingly, GABA <sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated tonic current density remained unchanged in either dorsal or ventral hippocampal DG granule cells during rIAPP application. This region-specific and inhibition type-specific effect of rIAPP is likely associated with differential modulation of presynaptic GABA release as well as postsynaptic GABA <sub>A</sub> receptors in the ventral as compared to the dorsal hippocampus. Our results suggest that rodent IAPP acts as a neuromodulator in hippocampal subregions by altering the strength of GABA <sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory signaling.",Front Cell Neurosci
40123832,ATP11B Modulates Microglial Lipid Metabolism and Alleviates Alzheimer's Disease Pathology.,"Abnormal lipid metabolism in microglia leads to the formation of pathological lipid droplets (LDs), a phenomenon also observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The abnormal accumulation of LDs disrupts normal cellular function and exacerbates the pathological process of AD. ATP11B is a P4-ATPase and the expression of Atp11b changes in the brain of patients with AD and diseases of lipid metabolism. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory role of ATP11B in microglial lipid metabolism and assess the potential of ATP11B as a therapeutic target for AD. Atp11b deficiency caused excessive fatty acid uptake and activated the PPAR signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal synthesis of neutral lipids and mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia. Further results showed that Atp11b deficiency led to the accumulation of pathological LDs in microglia and AD mice. Conversely, overexpression of Atp11b alleviated exploratory behavior impairment, learning and memory impairment, LD accumulation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and inflammatory response in the brain of AD mice. These findings provide important clues for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and for developing novel therapeutic strategies.",MedComm (2020)
40145307,Brain structural alterations in young women with premature ovarian insufficiency: Implications for dementia risk.,"INTRODUCTION: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), marked by ovarian function loss before age 40, is linked to a higher risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associated brain structural changes remain poorly understood.
METHODS: We analyzed T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in 33 idiopathic POI women and 51 healthy controls, using voxel-based, surface-based morphometry, and network analyses to assess gray matter volume (GMV), cortical thickness, and brain connectivity.
RESULTS: Women with POI showed significant GMV and cortical thickness reductions in the frontal, parietal, and temporal regions (p < 0.05), alongside impaired connectivity with key regions such as the hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala (p < 0.05). Younger POI subgroups exhibited changes in more widespread brain regions. In additionally, notable atrophy was observed in specific hippocampal and thalamic subregions in POI (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: This preliminary study suggests early neurodegenerative patterns in POI, potentially contributing to dementia risk. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.
HIGHLIGHTS: We evaluated brain structural changes in participants with idiopathic premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). The observed brain alterations in POI participants closely resemble those seen in early dementia, including regions specifically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight the critical need for early interventions to reduce the long-term risks of cognitive impairment and dementia in women with POI.",Alzheimers Dement
40145251,Motor symptoms in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease increase the risk of progression to severe cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor symptoms may present throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) course. We evaluated the impact of motor symptoms on the risk of progression to severe cognitive impairment, severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), and mortality in patients with autopsy-confirmed AD. We also examined the rates of non-AD pathology and identified the predictors of disease progression among these patients.
METHODS: Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) were used for this analysis. Participants (N = 1167) were required to have autopsy-confirmed AD.
RESULTS: Motor symptoms were predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment but not progression to severe NPSs or death. Presenting with gait disturbance and slowness but not falls or tremor was predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with motor symptoms had higher rates of Lewy body disease pathology on autopsy.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the presence of motor symptoms in autopsy-confirmed AD, particularly gait disturbance and slowness, are predictive of more rapid cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Clinician-defined motor symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) predicted more rapid progression to severe cognitive impairment but not to severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) or death. Among AD patients with motor symptoms, presenting with gait disturbance and slowness was predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment, whereas presenting with falls and tremor was not predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with motor symptoms, particularly gait disturbance and slowness, had higher rates of comorbid Lewy body disease pathology.",Alzheimers Dement
40038765,The neuroimmune nexus: unraveling the role of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING signal pathway in Alzheimer's disease.,"The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuroimmunity has gradually begun to be unveiled. Emerging evidence indicates that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) acts as a cytosolic DNA sensor, recognizing cytosolic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and inducing the innate immune response by activating stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Dysregulation of this pathway culminates in AD-related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. A substantial body of evidence indicates that mitochondria are involved in the critical pathogenic mechanisms of AD, whose damage leads to the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the extramitochondrial space. This leaked mtDNA serves as a DAMP, activating various pattern recognition receptors and immune defense networks in the brain, including the cGAS-STING pathway, ultimately leading to an imbalance in immune homeostasis. Therefore, modulation of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway to restore neuroimmune homeostasis may offer promising prospects for improving AD treatment outcomes. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of mtDNA release during stress and the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Additionally, we delve into the research progress on this pathway in AD, and further discuss the primary directions and potential hurdles in developing targeted therapeutic drugs, to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and provide new approaches for its therapy.",Mol Neurodegener

VGF peptide in CSF was analyzed using mass spectrometry.ResultsWe observed decreased CSF VGF in preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia individuals than amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals. Reduced CSF VGF was associated with cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, ventricle enlargement, and glucose hypometabolism at baseline, and it predicted a more marked deterioration over time.ConclusionsOur findings support the important contributions of VGF to disease pathogenesis and progression in the early stages of AD. Exploring the biologics modulating VGF might be a promising approach for AD prevention and early treatment.",J Alzheimers Dis
40084546,Advances in PET Imaging of α7 Nicotinic Receptors: From Radioligand Development to CNS Applications.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) has significantly advanced our understanding of the brain by enabling non-invasive imaging and quantification of molecular processes, including receptor binding. In this review, we explore the development and application of PET radioligands targeting the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), a receptor implicated in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and cognitive disorders. Despite challenges associated with the low density of α7 nAChRs and difficulties in achieving adequate brain penetration, several promising radioligands have been developed, including <sup>11</sup>C-(R)-MeQAA, <sup>11</sup>C-NS14492 and <sup>18</sup>F-ASEM. These radioligands facilitate the evaluation of the 'three pillars of survival' in drug development: tissue accessibility, target engagement and downstream pharmacology. PET imaging offers critical insights into drug distribution across the blood-brain barrier, receptor occupancy and the pharmacodynamic effects of α7 nAChR-targeted therapies. By reviewing current radioligands and their applications, we highlight the potential of PET imaging to deepen our understanding of α7 nAChR-mediated signalling pathways and its implications for CNS drug discovery. Future innovations in radioligand development, including more selective and brain-penetrant compounds, will be key to fully realizing the potential of PET imaging in α7 nAChR-targeted research and treatment.",Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol
40088623,Relation of Alzheimer's disease-related TDP-43 proteinopathy to metrics from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI).,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) deposition is linked to regional brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but diffusion changes associated with AD-related TDP-43 proteinopathy remain underexplored. This study evaluates the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) as in vivo markers for detecting TDP-43 proteinopathy in AD. We analyzed DTI and NODDI metrics in 49 cases with AD neuropathologic changes, categorized by postmortem TDP-43 status. Diffusion metrics from the temporal lobe gray and white matter regions and key white matter tracts were compared between TDP-43-positive and negative cases. Group differences were significant in the left hippocampus, amygdala, and uncinate fasciculus after adjusting for age, Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage and APOE ε4 status. TDP-43-positive cases showed increased mean diffusivity (MD) and altered neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis revealed high predictive accuracy for amygdala ODI (AUC = 0.809, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.76), hippocampal MD (AUC = 0.763, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.67), and uncinate fasciculus MD (AUC = 0.782, sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.61). Combined, DTI/NODDI predictors demonstrated stronger discriminative ability (AUC = 0.856, sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.76). These findings suggest that AD-related TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with specific diffusion changes in the left temporal lobe. DTI and NODDI metrics, particularly MD, NDI, and ODI, may improve the antemortem detection of TDP-43 pathology in AD.",Neurobiol Aging
40020805,Functionalized carbon dots with guanidine salt ionic liquid regulate oxidative damage and amyloid aggregation.,"An imbalance in the brain microenvironment, involving oxidative stress and β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, is thought to be one of the primary characteristics of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the intricate pathophysiology of AD, therapeutic approaches that can concurrently control several diseases in the AD microenvironment are desperately needed. This study created a guanidine salt ionic liquid functionalized carbon dots (CDs@TGM-IL) to mitigate Aβ aggregation-induced cytotoxicity and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) simultaneously. In vitro studies have shown that CDs@TGM-IL can effectively inhibit Aβ<sub>42</sub> protein aggregation, disaggregate mature Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrils, and effectively remove ROS. In vivo studies have found that CDs@TGM-IL can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and improve cognitive performance in AD mice. Just as importantly, CDs@TGM-IL has been shown to have unparalleled biocompatibility. This means that CDs@TGM-IL is expected to be a possible treatment for AD.",Int J Biol Macromol
40141087,"Multi-Ancestry Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies of Cognitive Function, White Matter Hyperintensity, and Alzheimer's Disease.","Genetic variants increase the risk of neurocognitive disorders in later life, including vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the precise relationships between genetic risk factors and underlying disease etiologies are not well understood. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) can be leveraged to better characterize the genes and biological pathways underlying genetic influences on disease. To date, almost all existing TWASs on VaD and AD have been conducted using expression studies from individuals of a single genetic ancestry, primarily European. Using the joint likelihood-based inference framework in Multi-ancEstry TRanscriptOme-wide analysis (METRO), we leveraged gene expression data from European ancestry (EA) and African ancestry (AA) samples to identify genes associated with general cognitive function, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and AD. Regions were fine-mapped using Fine-mapping Of CaUsal gene Sets (FOCUS). We identified 266, 23, 69, and 2 genes associated with general cognitive function, WMH, AD (using EA GWAS summary statistics), and AD (using AA GWAS), respectively (Bonferroni-corrected alpha = p &lt; 2.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), some of which had been previously identified. Enrichment analysis showed that many of the identified genes were in pathways related to innate immunity, vascular dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Further, the downregulation of ICA1L was associated with a higher WMH and with AD, indicating its potential contribution to overlapping AD and VaD neuropathology. To our knowledge, our study is the first TWAS on cognitive function and neurocognitive disorders that used expression mapping studies for multiple ancestries. This work may expand the benefits of TWASs beyond a single ancestry group and help to identify gene targets for pharmaceuticals or preventative treatments for dementia.",Int J Mol Sci
40156802,The Effects of Consumption of Cooked Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Serotonin Precursor Diets on Scopolamine-Impaired Memory and Motor Co-ordination in Mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (memory impairment disorder) and motor co-ordination disorders are on the increase worldwide. 5-Hydroxytryphamine (serotonin) is involved in short term memory and motor co-ordination (Buhot et al., 2000., Cabaj et al., 2017).  Whether beans that contain serotonin precursor (tryptophan) can ameliorate memory and motor co-ordination impairment has not been previously ascertained. Therefore, this research was to study the effects of consumption of cooked beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and serotonin precursor diets on scopolamine-impaired memory and motor co-ordination in mice. Sixty mice were randomly assigned into 6 groups (10 mice per group) namely; Control, Scopolamine only, Scopolamine with 50% cooked beans diet, Scopolamine with serotonin precursor diet, 50% cooked beans diet only and serotonin precursor diet only. Preliminary studies on phytochemical analyses were done before learning/memory and motor co-ordination were also studied. Standard methods were used to study learning/memory and motor coordination. The results showed that preliminary phytochemical screening of cooked beans indicated the presence of tryptophan, flavonoids, alkaloids, and polyphenols (antioxidants). Learning was impaired in Scopolamine only group compared to control and other test groups (p<0.05). Memory was also impaired in scopolamine only group compared to all other experimental groups (p<0.05). Motor co-ordination was also impaired in scopolamine only group compared to all other groups (p<0.05). In conclusion, consumption of beans and serotonin precursor diets improved memory and motor coordination in scopolamine impaired memory and motor co-ordination in mice. The memory and motor co-ordination enhancement observed may be attributed to serotonin synthesized from tryptophan in beans.",Niger J Physiol Sci
40032716,The Peripheral Amyloid-β Nexus: Connecting Alzheimer's Disease with Atherosclerosis through Shared Pathophysiological Mechanisms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherosclerosis (AS) are two chronic diseases with seemingly distinct pathologies. However, emerging research points to a bidirectional relationship driven by common mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of Amyloid-Beta (Aβ). This review focuses on the role of Aβ as a critical molecular link between AD and AS, emphasizing its contribution to neuronal impairment and vascular damage. Specifically, peripheral Aβ produced in the pancreas and skeletal muscle tissues exacerbates AS by promoting endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance (IR). Furthermore, AS accelerates AD progression by impairing cerebral blood flow and inducing chronic hypoxia, causing Aβ accumulation. This review critically evaluates recent findings, highlighting inconsistencies in clinical studies and suggesting future research directions. Understanding the bidirectional influence of AD and AS could pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting shared molecular pathways, particularly emphasizing Aβ clearance and inflammation.",Neuromolecular Med
40166037,Large-scale Plasma Proteomic Profiling Unveils Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers and Pathways for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Proteomic studies have been instrumental in identifying AD-related proteins present in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. This study comprehensively examined 6,905 plasma proteins in more than 3,300 well-characterized individuals to identify new proteins, pathways, and predictive model for AD. With three-stage analysis (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis) we identified 416 proteins (294 novel) associated with clinical AD status and the findings were further validated in two external datasets including more than 7,000 samples and seven previous studies. Pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in endothelial and blood hemostatic (ACHE, SMOC1, SMOC2, VEGFA, VEGFB, SPARC), capturing blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to disease. Other pathways were capturing known processes implicated in AD, such as lipid dysregulation (APOE, BIN1, CLU, SMPD1, PLA2G12A, CTSF) or immune response (C5, CFB, DEFA5, FBXL4), which includes proteins known to be part of the causal pathway indicating that some of the identified proteins and pathways are involved in disease pathogenesis. An enrichment of brain and neural pathways (axonal guidance signaling or myelination signaling) indicates that, in fact, blood proteomics capture brain- and disease-related changes, which can lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and predictive models. Machine learning model was employed to identify a set of seven proteins that were highly predictive of both clinical AD (AUC > 0.72) and biomarker-defined AD status (AUC > 0.88), that were replicated in multiple external cohorts as well as with orthogonal platforms. These extensive findings underscore the potential of using plasma proteins as biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of AD, as well as potentially guiding treatment decisions.",Res Sq
39976167,"Quebec French Version of the Hayling Sentence Completion Test: Error Scoring Guidelines, Normative Data for Adults and the Elderly and Validation Study in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.","INTRODUCTION: Deficits in inhibition have been associated with various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. The Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT) is an assessment tool commonly used in clinical settings to measure verbal initiation and prepotent verbal response inhibition. Although it is used by numerous clinical and research groups in Quebec, normative data for the HSCT are not yet available for French-Quebec speakers.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to provide error scoring guidelines and normative data in the adult population of French Quebec for the HSCT-QC (Study 1) and to determine its known-group discriminant validity (Study 2).
RESULTS: The results of Study 1, based on a sample of 214 healthy individuals aged 50 to 89, indicated that age significantly affected test performance, while educational level and sex did not. As no transformations were able to normalize the score distribution, percentile ranks for HSCT-QC performance were calculated solely based on age. Results from Study 2 demonstrated that the HSCT-QC effectively distinguishes the performance of healthy participants from those with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: Norms and psychometric data for the HSCT-QC will be highly beneficial for assessing inhibitory control in French-speaking adults in Quebec, Canada.",Arch Clin Neuropsychol
40150012,Exploratory Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid IL-6 and IL-17A Levels in Subcortical Small-Vessel Disease Compared to Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study.,"Background/Objectives: Low-grade inflammation in the form of microglial activation may be involved in neurodegenerative and vascular dementias. Subcortical small-vessel disease (SSVD) is the main form of vascular dementia, associated with brain barrier dysfunction and endothelial and monocyte activation. IL-6 and IL-17A are known proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the disruption of blood-brain barrier integrity and microvascular dysfunction, features that are central to SSVD pathophysiological pathways. We herein compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6 and IL-17A concentrations in SSVD and AD patients as well as control subjects and examined the potential associations among IL-6 and IL-17A levels with cognitive and ΜRΙ changes. The albumin quotient (Qalb) was also calculated. Methods: CSF IL-6 and IL-17A (18 SSVD, 17 AD, and 12 healthy controls) were measured with solid-phase sandwich ELISAs, while albumin levels were measured by immunonephelometry. MMSE, FAB, and the CLOX tests were used for cognitive assessment and MRI was used for atrophy and white matter hyperintensities. Results: Significantly elevated CSF levels of Qalb and IL-6 were found in SSVD patients compared to both AD (p = 0.02) and controls (p = 0.002), respectively. Moreover, CSF IL-6 levels displayed a significant inverse correlation with CLOX2 scores (r = -0.641, p = 0.02), as well as a positive correlation with the total normalized CSF volume (r = 0.7, p = 0.01). CSF IL-17A levels were found to be reduced in SSVD patients, compared to controls and AD patients (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The IL-6/IL-17A ratio with a cut-off value &gt; 1.004 displayed a sensitivity of 83.33% (95%CI; 60.78% to 94.16%) and a specificity of 68.97% (95%CI; 50.77% to 82.72%) for the discrimination of SSVD from AD patients and controls. Conclusions: In the present pilot single-center study, we found increased CSF IL-6 and IL-6/IL-17A ratio levels in SSVD patients that correlated with reduced scores in the CLOX2 test and increased CSF volume. These preliminary findings deserve further evaluation in larger cohorts in order to elucidate their potential as surrogate biomarkers for the discrimination of SSVD from AD pathology.",Diagnostics (Basel)
40085471,DenseFormer-MoE: A Dense Transformer Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Multi-Task Brain Image Analysis.,"Deep learning models have been widely investigated for computing and analyzing brain images across various downstream tasks such as disease diagnosis and age regression. Most existing models are tailored for specific tasks and diseases, posing a challenge in developing a foundation model for diverse tasks. This paper proposes a Dense Transformer Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts (DenseFormer-MoE), which integrates dense convolutional network, Vision Transformer and Mixture of Experts (MoE) to progressively learn and consolidate local and global features from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (sMRI) for multiple tasks including diagnosing multiple brain diseases and predicting brain age. First, a foundation model is built by combining the vision Transformer with Densenet, which are pre-trained with Masked Autoencoder and self-supervised learning to enhance the generalization of feature representations. Then, to mitigate optimization conflicts in multi-task learning, MoE is designed to dynamically select the most appropriate experts for each task. Finally, our method is evaluated on multiple renowned brain imaging datasets including UK Biobank (UKB), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Experimental results and comparison demonstrate that our method achieves promising performances for prediction of brain age and diagnosis of brain diseases.",IEEE Trans Med Imaging
40070848,Reduced protein solubility - cause or consequence in amyloid disease?,"In this perspective, we ask the question whether the apparently lower solubility of specific proteins in amyloid disease is a cause or consequence of the protein deposition seen in such diseases. We focus on Alzheimer's disease and start by reviewing the experimental evidence of disease-associated reduction in the measured concentration of amyloid β peptide, Aβ42, in cerebrospinal fluid. We propose a series of possible physicochemical explanations for these observations. These include a reduced solubility, a reduced apparent solubility, as well as a long-lived metastable state manifested in healthy individuals as a free concentration of Aβ42 in the solution phase above the solubility limit. For each scenario, we discuss whether it is most likely a cause or a consequence of the observed protein deposition in the disease.",QRB Discov
40008330,Neurovascular phase coherence is altered in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia, but its cause still remains elusive. It is characterized by neurodegeneration, with amyloid-beta and tau aggregation. Recently, however, the roles of the vasculature and the neurovascular unit are being highlighted as important for disease progression. In particular, there is reduced microvascular density, and altered gene expression in vascular and glial cells. Structural changes naturally impact the functioning of the neurovascular unit, and the goal of the study was to quantify the corresponding changes in vivo, non-invasively. Our assessment is based on recordings of brain oxygenation, neuronal and cardiorespiratory activities, captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram and respiration effort, respectively. Two groups were compared: an Alzheimer's disease group (N = 19) and a control group (N = 20) of similar age. The time-series were analysed using methods that can capture multi-scale and time-varying oscillations such as the wavelet transform power and wavelet phase coherence. The Alzheimer's disease group shows a significant decrease in the power of brain oxygenation oscillations compared to the control group. There is also a significant global reduction in the phase coherence between brain oxygenation time-series. The neurovascular phase coherence around 0.1 Hz is also significantly reduced in the Alzheimer's disease group. In addition, the average respiration rate is increased in the Alzheimer's disease group compared to the control group. We show that the phase coherence between vascular and neuronal activities is reduced in Alzheimer's disease compared to the control group, indicating altered functioning of the neurovascular unit. The brain oxygenation dynamics reveals reduced power and coordination of oscillations, especially in frequency ranges that are associated with vasomotion. This could lead to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, which could affect ATP production, and potentially reduce amyloid-beta clearance. These changes in neurovascular dynamics have potential for early diagnosis, as a marker of disease progression, and for evaluating the effect of interventions.",Brain Commun
40016780,HCN2 deficiency correlates with memory deficits and hyperexcitability of dCA1 pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal excitability of hippocampal neurons may lead to dysfunction of neural circuits and then causes cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
METHODS: Electrophysiology was performed to examine the intrinsic excitability of CA1 neurons and the activity of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCNs) of CA1 neurons in wild type (WT) and hAPP-J20 mice. The activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) was modulated with chemogenetics. The activity of HCNs was regulated with nonselective facilitator (cAMP) or inhibitor (ZD7288) of HCNs. Immunohistochemical staining or western blotting were performed to examine the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 in the hippocampus of WT and hAPP-J20 mice, or AD patients and non-AD controls. AAVs were injected to specifically modulate the expression of HCN2 in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) PNs. Cognitive performance of mice was assessed with behavioral tests.
RESULTS: dCA1 PNs were more excitable in hAPP-J20 mice, but the excitability of PNs in the ventral CA1 (vCA1) or PV neurons was comparable between WT and hAPP-J20 mice. The activity of the HCNs was reduced in dCA1 PNs of hAPP-J20 mice, and pharmacologically increasing the activity of HCNs attenuated the hyperexcitability of dCA1 PNs in hAPP-J20 mice, suggesting that the reduced activity of HCNs is associated with the hyperexcitability of dCA1 PNs in hAPP-J20 mice. The expression of HCN2 but not HCN1 was reduced in the hippocampus of hAPP-J20 mice, and the expression of HCN2 was also reduced in the hippocampus of AD patients, suggesting that dysregulation of HCN2 is associated with the reduced activity of HCNs in AD. Overexpressing HCN2 rescued the activity of HCNs, attenuated the hyperexcitability of dCA1 PNs and improved memory of hAPP-J20 mice, and knocking down HCN2 impaired the function of HCNs, increased the excitability of dCA1 PNs and led to memory deficits in WT mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dysregulation of HCNs, particularly HCN2, contributes to the abnormal excitability of CA1 PNs in AD mice and probably in AD patients as well, and thus provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the aberrant activity or excitability of hippocampal neurons in AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther
40033044,"Brain O-GlcNAcylation: Bridging physiological functions, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic applications.","O-GlcNAcylation, a dynamic post-translational modification occurring on serine or threonine residues of numerous proteins, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including gene regulation, metabolism, and stress response. Abundant in the brain, O-GlcNAcylation intricately governs neurodevelopment, synaptic assembly, and neuronal functions. Recent investigations have established a correlation between the dysregulation of brain O-GlcNAcylation and a broad spectrum of neurological disorders and injuries, spanning neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric conditions, as well as injuries to the central nervous system (CNS).

40155270,Donanemab: Appropriate use recommendations.,"Donanemab (Kisunla®), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting N-terminal pyroglutamate-modified forms of amyloid-β, is approved in the United States for treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Appropriate Use Recommendations (AUR) were developed to guide the implementation of donanemab in real-world practice, prioritizing safety considerations and opportunity for effectiveness. The AUR were developed by the AD and Related Disorders Therapeutic Workgroup by consensus, integrating available data and expert opinion. Appropriate candidates for donanemab treatment include persons with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD (Clinical Stages 3-4, MMSE 20-30) who have biomarker confirmation of AD pathology by PET or CSF. Tau PET is not required for eligibility. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping should be performed prior to treatment to inform an individual's risk of developing Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA). Pre-treatment MRI should be obtained no more than 12 months prior to treatment. Patients with findings of >4 cerebral microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis or a major vascular contribution to cognitive impairment should be excluded from treatment. The decision to initiate therapy should be grounded in a shared decision-making process that emphasizes the patient's values and goals of care. Donanemab is administered as a monthly intravenous infusion. Surveillance MRIs to evaluate for ARIA should be performed prior to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 7th infusions, prior to the 12th dose in higher risk individuals, and at any time ARIA is suspected clinically. Clinicians may consider discontinuing treatment if amyloid clearance is demonstrated by amyloid PET, typically obtained 12-18 months after initiating treatment.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
40167814,Associations of moderate alcohol intake with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease: data from the ALBION study.,"PURPOSE: According to a WHO statement, it has been asserted that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption regarding human health. Nevertheless, the relationship between alcohol consumption and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains unclear. Therefore, we examined whether the frequency and patterns of alcohol consumption could predict neurodegeneration biomarkers in a cohort of middle-aged adults without dementia.
METHODS: A total of 195 participants without dementia were included from the ALBION study. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted using drinking frequency subgroups (abstainers, occasional drinkers, and light-to-moderate drinkers) and Mediterranean-Alcohol Dietary Pattern (MADP) adherence subgroups along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers (Tau, phosphorylated tau (PTau) and amyloid beta (Aβ). In these analyses, the abstinence was used as the reference category.
RESULTS: Of the 195 individuals without dementia, 66% were female, with an average age of 65 ± 9.4 years, and they had 13.8 ± 3.6 years of education. Logistic regression analyses revealed that light-to-moderate drinkers (n = 51) were associated with higher Aβ positivity [OR: 2.98 (1.29-6.90)] compared to the abstinence (n = 117). Additionally, high adherence to the MADP was significantly associated with higher Aβ, Tau/Aβ<sub>42,</sub> and PTau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratios positivity compared to the abstinence.
CONCLUSION: Light-to-moderate alcohol intake was associated with higher Aβ deposition in middle-aged individuals without dementia, compared to abstinence. High adherence to the MADP, which indicates low-to-moderate red wine consumption distributing over the week with meals, was associated with a higher Aβ and Tau/Aβ and PTau/Aβ positivity. Therefore, the management of alcohol consumption may help improve AD outcomes even at the preclinical stage.",Eur J Nutr

Despite the limited number of studies and small sample sizes, findings suggest that engaging VR environments can motivate patients, fostering adherence to treatment. This commentary underscores the need for further research to validate these results and establish standardized methodologies for the effective use of VR in dementia care. Several methodological aspects and new perspectives are highlighted herein.",J Alzheimers Dis
39996839,"Exploring the Efficacy and Target Genes of Atractylodes Macrocephala Koidz Against Alzheimer's Disease Based on Multi-Omics, Computational Chemistry, and Experimental Verification.","OBJECTIVE: To unveil the efficacy and ferroptosis-related mechanisms of Atractylodes Macrocephala Koidz (AMK) against Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease.
METHODS: Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores were used to investigate the relationship between ferroptosis and AD. Logistic regression with seven feature selections and a deep learning model were utilized to identify potential targets of AMK based on transcriptomic data from multiple tissues. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), summary-data-based mendelian randomization (SMR), and mendelian randomization (MR) were utilized to validate the causal relationship between target genes and AD risk. A single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to investigate the biological pathways associated with the target genes. Three molecular docking strategies and a molecular dynamics simulation were employed to verify the binding domains interacting with AMK. Furthermore, the anti-AD effects of AMK were validated in a zebrafish AD model by testing behavior responses, apoptosis, and the deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain. Ultimately, real-time qPCR was used to verify the ferroptosis-related targets, which was identified via multi-omics.
RESULTS: Ferroptosis is an important pathogenic mechanism of AD, as suggested by the GSVA scores. AMK may exert its anti-AD activity through targets genes identified in the brain (ATP5MC3, GOT1, SAT1, EGFR, and MAPK9) and blood (G6PD, PGD, ALOX5, HMOX1, and ULK1). EGFR and HMOX1 were further confirmed as target genes mediating the anti-AD activity of AMK through TWAS, SMR, and MR analyses. The GSEA results indicated that EGFR may be involved in oxidative phosphorylation-related pathways, while HMOX1 may be associated with lysosome and phagosome pathways. The results of three molecular docking strategies and molecular dynamics simulations implied that the kinase domain of EGFR and the catalytic domain of HMOX1 played pivotal roles in the interaction between AMK and the targets. In a zebrafish model, AD-like symptoms including motor slowness and delayed responses, neuronal apoptosis, and plaque deposition in the brain, were significantly improved after AMK treatment. Accordingly, AMK reversed the abnormal expression of egfra and hmox1a, two core targets genes involved in ferroptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: AMK significantly alleviated AD-like symptoms through the modulation of EGFR and HMOX1, which might reduce lipid peroxidation, thereby suppressing ferroptosis. This study provided evidence supporting the efficacy and therapeutic targets associated with ferroptosis in AMK-treated AD, which aid in the development of therapeutic interventions.",Curr Issues Mol Biol
40102986,Improving effects of melatonin on memory and synaptic potentiation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's-like disease: the involvement of glutamate homeostasis and mGluRs receptors.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction, largely driven by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. These pathological hallmarks disrupt glutamate signaling, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of melatonin on memory and synaptic plasticity in an AD-like mouse model, with a focus on its regulatory effects on glutamate homeostasis and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs).
METHODS: The study began with an in-silico bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq datasets from hippocampal tissues of AD patients to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to glutamate signaling and tau pathology. An AD-like model was induced via intra-hippocampal injection of cis-phospho tau in C57BL/6 mice. Memory function was assessed using behavioral tests. Synaptic plasticity was evaluated using in vitro field potential recording of hippocampal slices. Histological analyses included Nissl staining for neuronal density, Luxol Fast Blue for myelin integrity, and immunofluorescence for tau hyperphosphorylation. Molecular studies employed qPCR and Western blot to assess glutamate-related markers and tau phosphorylation. Melatonin (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, starting either two weeks (early intervention) or four weeks (late intervention) post-induction.
RESULTS: Key molecular targets in glutamate signaling pathways were identified using bioinformatics. AD-like mice displayed memory deficits and synaptic dysfunction. Melatonin improved cognitive function, especially with early intervention, as confirmed by behavioral tests. Histological studies revealed reduced neuronal loss, improved myelin integrity, and decreased tau hyperphosphorylation. Molecular findings showed restored mGluR expression and reduced GSK3 activity. Early intervention yielded superior outcomes, with partial restoration of synaptic plasticity observed in LTP recordings.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the neuroprotective properties of melatonin, mediated by its ability to modulate glutamate signaling and mGluR activity, offering new insights into its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD. Additionally, the results suggest that earlier administration of melatonin may significantly enhance its efficacy, highlighting the importance of timely intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",Behav Brain Funct

40123533,Delineating the tryptophan-galactosylamine conjugate mediated structural distortions in Aβ<sub>42</sub> protofibrils.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrillation into neurotoxic soluble oligomers and mature fibrils is mainly responsible for the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study revealed 61% disaggregation of the pre-formed Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrils upon incubating with a highly soluble tryptophan-galactosylamine conjugate, WGalNAc. WGalNAc displayed no toxicity and increased the viability of SH-SY5Y cells up to 62.9 ± 2% with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.3 μM against Aβ<sub>42</sub> pre-formed fibrils. However, the key interactions and disruptive mechanism of WGalNAc against Aβ fibrils remain elusive. Thus, mechanistic insights into the disruptive potential of WGalNAc against Aβ<sub>42</sub> protofibrils (PDB: 5OQV) were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The molecular docking depicted a favourable binding energy (-6.60 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) and interaction of WGalNAc with the central hydrophobic core (CHC) region of chain A of the 5OQV protofibril. The MD simulations depicted that WGalNAc disrupted the contacts among Ala2, Phe4, Leu34, and Val36 in the hydrophobic core 1 of the 5OQV protofibril responsible for maintaining the stability of the LS-shaped 5OQV protofibril. WGalNAc binds favourably to the 5OQV protofibril (ΔG<sub>binding</sub> = -21.76 ± 2.40 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) with a significant contribution from the van der Waals interaction term. Notably, the binding affinity between the neighbouring chains of the 5OQV protofibril was significantly reduced from -134.31 ± 11.12 to -121.88 ± 1.95 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> upon the incorporation of WGalNAc, which is consistent with the ThT kinetic results that revealed disaggregation of the pre-formed Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrils upon incubating with WGalNAc. The in silico ADMET properties of WGalNAc showed its ability as a promising therapeutic candidate due to its blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, extended half-life, and non-toxic profile. The MD simulations illuminated the binding interactions of WGalNAc with the 5OQV protofibril and provided mechanistic insights into the WGalNAc-mediated structural distortions in the 5OQV protofibril.",Phys Chem Chem Phys
40043970,Impact of tyrosine amination on the aggregation and neurotoxicity of amyloid-β.,"The tyrosine residue in amyloid-β (Aβ) is susceptible to attack by various reactive nitrogen intermediates, leading to the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a post-translational modification associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although considered a ""dead-end"" product, emerging evidence suggests that 3-NT can be reduced to 3-aminotyrosine (3-AT) in vivo. This study aims to validate the amination of Aβ tyrosine under physiological conditions and systematically investigate its impact on the aggregation and neurotoxicity of Aβ42. Our investigations reveal that tyrosine amination mitigates the highly ordered β-structure content of Aβ42, thereby modulating its aggregation pathway, which is primarily dominated by the multi-step secondary nucleation. Aminotyrosine fibrils exhibit enhanced fragmentation, increasing fibril elongation rate, and insoluble aggregate production. Concurrently, tyrosine amination attenuates the neurotoxicity of Aβ42 by reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitigating cell membrane disruption. Tyrosine amination substantially alters the aggregation and physiological properties of Aβ42. Nitration of Aβ42 and subsequent conversion to tyrosine-aminated Aβ42 may represent an intrinsic defensive response against AD under nitrative stress.",Int J Biol Macromol
40057609,Effect of combined and intensive rehabilitation on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease evaluated through a randomized controlled trial.,"This study investigates the impact of combined special education and occupational therapy intervention on cognitive functions in Alzheimer's patients. Specifically, it evaluates changes measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) after six months compared to a control group receiving standard care. A longitudinal, controlled experiment was conducted with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The experimental group underwent three weekly interventions of 45-50 min over eight months in 2021. Cognitive functions were periodically assessed using ACE-R. Power analysis determined a sample size of 128 participants for adequate statistical power; the study included 60 participants (30 per group). Data were analyzed using non-parametric methods due to non-normal data distribution. The experimental group showed significant improvement in ACE-R scores compared to the control group. The mean difference in scores was 10.27 points (SD = 2.83) for the experimental group, indicating improved cognitive function, while the control group showed a mean decrease of 5.67 points (SD = 2.06). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between groups at both interim and final assessments (p < 0.001). The combined special education and occupational therapy intervention led to significant cognitive improvements in Alzheimer's patients compared to standard care. The study supports the efficacy of such interventions in enhancing cognitive functions, as evidenced by the substantial score increases in the experimental group.",Sci Rep
40122506,Neochlorogenic acid ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology via scavenging oxidative stress and restoring blood-brain barrier function in zebrafish.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease characterized by insidious onset and slow progression. At present, most available medications serve to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer's disease with side effects and drug resistance. Neochlorogenic acid is a natural polyphenolic compound with excellent antioxidant properties. Based on zebrafish Alzheimer's disease model induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub>, we found that neochlorogenic acid significantly improved motor dysfunction, reduced brain cell apoptosis, and Aβ plaque. Because of antioxidant stress and improvement of blood-brain barrier dysfunction are important in treating Alzheimer's disease, we explored the interaction between these two mechanisms in alleviating the pathological course of Alzheimer's disease. Neochlorogenic acid inhibited the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, suppressed the gene expression encoding antioxidant-related proteins, and protected brain cell integrity while enhancing Nrf2, improving blood-brain barrier nerve resilience. Meanwhile, neochlorogenic acid attenuated blood-brain barrier dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease zebrafish by reducing blood hemoglobin leakage and upregulating the gene expression encoding blood-brain barrier endothelial cell-related proteins, resulting in reactive oxygen species in a controllable state. In conclusion, our research suggests that neochlorogenic acid ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology by inhibiting oxidative stress and restoring blood-brain barrier function, indicating that neochlorogenic acid may be a potential drug for treating Alzheimer's disease.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry
40037511,Evaluating the causal effects of circulating metabolic biomarkers on Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging due to the complexity of its pathogenesis. Although research suggests a link between circulating metabolites and AD, their causal relationship is not fully understood.
METHODS: Based on publicly available genome-wide association study data, we investigated the causative relationship between AD (7759 cases and 334,740 controls) and 233 traits describing circulating metabolites (136,016 participants) using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. We adopted the inverse variance weighted approach as the priority and performed sensitivity analyses with MR-Egger intercept method and Cochran's Q test.
RESULTS: The overall causal effect of circulating metabolic traits on AD was significantly higher than the inverse effect (beta: 0.15 ± 0.42 vs. 0.04 ± 0.07; p < 0.05). A total of 72 circulating metabolic traits (odd ratio (OR): 1.16-2.48) had a significant positive causal effect on AD, while a total of 16 circulating metabolic traits with significant negative causal effects on AD were detected (OR: 0.38-0.88). AD had a significant positive causal effect (OR: 1.02-1.17) on 142 circulating metabolic traits and a negative causal effect (OR: 0.87-0.99) on 43 circulating metabolic traits. Circulating metabolites that have a bi-directional causative relationship with AD mainly include apolipoprotein B levels, total cholesterol levels, total triglycerides levels, and omega-6 fatty acids levels.
CONCLUSION: The causative relationship between AD and the circulating metabolic traits is complex and bidirectional. Analyzing metabolites causally involved in the development of AD may provide clues for identifying preventive and therapeutic targets for this disorder.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry
39993589,Network-based analysis of Alzheimer's Disease genes using multi-omics network integration with graph diffusion.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms behind AD remain elusive. Many studies suggest that disease-responsible genes often act as hub genes in biological networks. However, this assumption requires further investigation in the context of AD. To examine the network characteristics of known AD genes, it is crucial to construct a highly confident network, which is challenging to achieve using a single data source. This work integrates multi-omics networks inferred from microarray, single-cell RNA sequencing, and single-nuclei RNA sequencing expression data, weighted with protein interaction and gene ontology information. We generate a high-quality integrated network by utilizing various inference methods and combining them through a graph diffusion-based integration approach. This network is then analyzed to investigate the properties of known AD-specific genes. Our findings reveal that AD genes are not always high-degree or central hub nodes in the network. Instead, these genes are distributed across different quartiles of degree centrality while maintaining significant interconnections for effective regulation. Furthermore, our study highlights that peripheral genes, often overlooked, also play crucial roles by connecting to relevant disease nodes and hub genes. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that AD-responsible genes are primarily the hub genes in the network, offering new insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of AD and suggesting novel directions for future research.",J Biomed Inform

39978656,Interleukin-2 and its receptors: Implications and therapeutic prospects in immune-mediated disorders of central nervous system.,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2), the first cloned cytokine, is a multifunctional molecule with diverse cellular origins. As a pivotal T-cell growth factor, IL-2 is crucial for T-cell proliferation and the generation of effector and memory cells. Besides, IL-2 and its receptor (IL-2R) are expressed in various cell types within the brain and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. In conditions characterized by primary or secondary inflammatory processes, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, and encephalitis, IL-2/IL-2R expression exhibits region- and subtype-specific and variations associated with disease stages in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissues. These variations highlight the potential of IL-2/IL-2R as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the roles, expression patterns, and regulatory mechanisms of IL-2/IL-2R in immune-mediated disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), with particular emphasis on the impact of genetic polymorphisms in IL-2 and IL-2R subunits on disease susceptibility and progression.

T2DM were 1:1 matched to non-T2DM using propensity scores generated by 8 covariates; age at diagnosis, sex, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive disorders, lipid disorders, obesity, and mood disorders. T2DM PRS was additionally matched in T2DM PRS matched analysis. Subgroup analyses by age at diagnosis, sex, and APOE4 genotype were performed with the same matching criteria within each subgroup. Cox proportional hazard and Fine &amp; Gray competing risk model were utilized.ResultsIn T2DM PRS unmatched cohort, 24,583 T2DM were 1:1 matched to non-T2DM. The mean age at diagnosis was around 62 years old, with females constituting around 40%. Up to 25-year follow-up, ADRD rate/1000 person-years was 0.88 versus 1.52 (Non-T2DM versus T2DM); PRS unmatched (cHR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.46-2.03) and matched (cHR:1.75, 95% CI: 1.47-2.09). Except for older age onset (≥75 years), the other subgroups demonstrated significantly increased ADRD risks in T2DM. T2DM PRS was higher in non-ADRD group across all subgroups. Contrarily, T2DM PRS was higher in ADRD in younger onset group (&lt;55 years).ConclusionsT2DM is one of the strong risk factors of ADRD but genetic T2DM effect does not contribute to ADRD risk. However, a genetic link might be present in younger age onset group.",J Alzheimers Dis
39987747,Altered spatiotemporal brain dynamics of interoception in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional allostatic-interoception, altered processing of bodily signals in response to environmental demands, occurs in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients. Previous research has not investigated the dynamic nature of interoception using methods like intrinsic neural timescales. We hypothesised that longer intrinsic neural timescales of interoception would occur in bvFTD patients, evidencing dysfunctional allostatic-interoception.
METHODS: One-hundred and twelve participants (31 bvFTD patients, 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, AD and 46 healthy controls) completed a well-validated task measuring cardiac-interoception and exteroception. Simultaneous EEG and ECG were recorded. Intrinsic neural timescales were measured via the autocorrelation window (ACW) of broadband EEG signals from each heartbeat and a time-lagged version of itself. Spatiotemporal clustering analyses identified clusters with significant between-group differences in each condition. Voxel-based morphometry was used to target the allostatic-interoceptive network. Neuropsychological tests of cognition and social cognition were assessed.
FINDINGS: In bvFTD patients, longer interoceptive-ACWs than controls were observed in the bilateral fronto-temporal and parietal regions. In AD patients, longer interoceptive-ACWs than controls were observed in central and occipitoparietal brain regions. No differences were observed during exteroception. In bvFTD patients only, longer interoceptive-ACW was linked to worse sociocognitive performance. Structural neural correlates of interoceptive-ACW in bvFTD involved the anterior cingulate, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and angular gyrus.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest a core allostatic-interoceptive deficit occurs in people with bvFTD. Further, altered interoceptive intrinsic neural timescales may provide a neurobiological mechanism underpinning the complex behaviours observed in bvFTD patients. Our findings support synergistic models of brain disease and can inform clinical practice.

40119171,A systematic review with a Burden of Proof meta-analysis of health effects of long-term ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure on dementia.,"Previous studies have indicated increased dementia risk associated with fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure; however, the findings are inconsistent. In this systematic review, we assessed the association between long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and dementia outcomes using the Burden of Proof meta-analytic framework, which relaxes log-linear assumptions to better characterize relative risk functions and quantify unexplained between-study heterogeneity (PROSPERO, ID CRD42023421869). Here we report a meta-analysis of 28 longitudinal cohort studies published up to June 2023 that investigated long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and dementia outcomes. We derived risk-outcome scores (ROSs), highly conservative measures of effect size and evidence strength, mapped onto a 1-5-star rating from 'weak and/or inconsistent evidence' to 'very strong and/or consistent evidence'. We identified a significant nonlinear relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and dementia, with a minimum 14% increased risk averaged across PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels between 4.5 and 26.9 µg m<sup>-3</sup> (the 15th to 85th percentile exposure range across included studies), relative to a reference of 2.0 µg m<sup>-3</sup> (n = 49, ROS = 0.13, two stars). We found a significant association of PM<sub>2.5</sub> with Alzheimer's disease (n = 12, ROS = 0.32, three stars) but not with vascular dementia.

40080089,"Big databases and biobanks for studying the links between CKD, cognitive impairment, and dementia.","Research on cognitive function in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is critical due to the significant public health challenge posed by both CKD and cognitive impairment. CKD affects approximately 10-15% of the adult population, with higher prevalence in the elderly, who are already at increased risk for cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment is notably higher in CKD patients, particularly those with severe stages of the disease, and progresses more rapidly in those on dialysis. This review explores how data from large biobank studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, UK Biobank, and others could be used to enhance understanding the progression and interplay between CKD and cognitive decline. Each of these data sources has specific strengths and limitations. Strengths include large sample sizes and longitudinal data across different groups, and in different settings. Addressing limitations leads to challenges in dealing with heterogeneous data collection methods, and addressing missing data, which requires the use of sophisticated statistical techniques. Combining data from multiple databases can mitigate individual study limitations, particularly via the 'epidemiological triangulation' concept. Using such data appropriately holds immense potential to better understand the pathobiology underlying CKD and cognitive impairment. Addressing the inherent challenges with a clear strategy is crucial for advancing our understanding and improving the lives of those affected by both CKD and cognitive impairment.",Nephrol Dial Transplant
40012679,TDP-43 as a potential retinal biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases.,"TDP-43 proteinopathies are a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) characterized by the pathological cytoplasmic aggregation of the TDP-43 protein. These include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and others. TDP-43 in the eye shows promise as a biomarker for these NDDs. Several studies have identified cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions in retinal layers of donors with ALS, FTLD, AD, CTE, and other conditions using immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that pathological aggregates of TDP-43 in the human retina are most prevalent in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and CTE, suggesting these diseases may provide the most reliable context for studying the potential of TDP-43 as a retinal biomarker. Animal model studies have been pivotal in exploring TDP-43's roles in the retina, including its nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, RNA binding properties, and interactions with other proteins. Despite these advances, more research is needed to develop therapeutic strategies. A major limitation of human autopsy studies is the lack of corresponding brain pathology assessments to confirm TDP-43 proteinopathy diagnosis and staging. Other limitations include small sample sizes, lack of antemortem eye pathology and clinical histories, and limited comparisons across multiple NDDs. Future directions for the TDP-43 as a retinal biomarker for NDDs include retinal tracers, hyperspectral imaging, oculomics, and machine learning development.",Front Neurosci

40092434,Quantification and stimulation of human glymphatic dynamics: New features of Alzheimer's disease and effects of brain photobiomodulation.,"A non-invasive device to measure the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly desirable because CSF facilitates the cleaning of neurotoxic wastes in the brain. A better understanding of CSF dynamics helps promote healthy aging in older adults and to treat patients with neurological diseases. This study employed a multi-color optical method to quantify prefrontal CSF dynamics in two groups: (1) older adults with (n = 16) and without (n = 27) Alzheimer's disease and (2) young adults (n = 26) before and after prefrontal light stimulation. The results revealed that the coupling strengths between cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CSF were age-dependent and significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls. Prefrontal light stimulation significantly enhanced CBV-CSF coupling, suggesting improved CSF drainage. This study underscores the multi-color optical strategy as a unique tool for monitoring the interaction between CBV and CSF, as well as metabolic functions in the human brain, while demonstrating the therapeutic potential of brain light stimulation in treating neurodegenerative diseases involving CSF drainage dysfunction.",Res Sq
40159555,Elucidating the role of peripheral monocyte nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inflammation in cognitive outcomes in older adults.,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are important regulators of brain and immune function that play critical roles in the neuropathology and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, quantifying nAChRs in the brain remains elusive, and little is known about peripheral measures of nAChR in older adults or their relationship to cognition. Here, we examined associations between nAChR expression and immunoregulatory function in peripheral blood monocytes and cognitive performance among 167 older adults (age 72.3 ± 7.6 years; 71% female). Penalized linear and logistic regression were used to identify nAChR-related features in classical, intermediate, and nonclassical monocytes, as well as immunophenotypes, clinical and sociodemographic factors, associated with cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA). Intermediate monocytes had the highest expression of alpha-7 nAChRs and greater ex vivo inflammatory responses (83.7% TNF-ɑ<sup>+</sup> cells) relative to classical (68.4%, d = 1.98, P &lt; 0.001) or nonclassical monocytes (58.9%, d = 3.20, P &lt; 0.001). Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI: N = 76) had higher soluble CD14 levels (1777 ± 377 pg/uL) and greater anticholinergic medication burden (ACB; mean = 1.76) than normocognitive participants (NC: N = 91; 1638 ± 352 pg/uL sCD14, t<sub>155</sub> = 2.78, P = 0.006; mean ACB: 1.05, t<sub>143</sub> = 3.13, P = 0.002). Multivariate regression models indicated that stronger nAChR-mediated immunoregulation in intermediate monocytes was associated with higher MoCA scores (beta = 0.13) and 14% lower odds of MCI, as well as lower ACB (beta = - 2.10; 95% CI - 4.14, - 0.61). This study demonstrates that peripheral monocytes exhibit subset-specific differences in nAChR phenotypes in older adults and provides preliminary evidence for their association with cognitive function and a potential mediating role between ACB and cognitive impairment.",Biogerontology
39989429,Novel plasma biomarkers of amyloid plaque pathology and cortical thickness: Evaluation of the NULISA targeted proteomic platform in an ethnically diverse cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Proteomic evaluation of plasma samples could accelerate the identification of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We evaluated the novel NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) proteomic method in an ethnically diverse cohort.
METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were measured with NULISA in the Human Connectome Project, a predominantly preclinical biracial community cohort in southwestern Pennsylvania. Selected biomarkers were additionally measured using Simoa and Quest immunoassays and compared.
RESULTS: On NULISA, phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau231, and p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT-tau) showed the top significant association with amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) status, followed by the neuroinflammation markers C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), chitotriosidase 1 (CHIT1) and interleukin-8 (CXCL8), and the synaptic marker neurogranin (NRGN). Biomarkers associated with cortical thickness included astrocytic protein chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), cytokine CD40 ligand (CD40LG), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the Aβ-associated metalloprotein TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotein 3), and ficolin 2 (FCN2). Furthermore, moderate to strong between-platform correlations were observed for various assays.
DISCUSSION: NULISA multiplexing advantage allowed concurrent assessment of established and novel plasma biomarkers of Aβ pathology and neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Classical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers measured using the NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) with next-generation sequencing readout (NULISAseq) CNS panel showed strong concordance with those measured using established immunoassay methods from Quanterix and Quest, with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) exhibiting the strongest correlation. NULISAseq proteomic analysis identified several plasma biomarkers strongly associated with AD pathology in a biracial community cohort of older adults. Notably, phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217), GFAP, and p-tau231 displayed the strongest association with amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was strongly associated with neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that plasma biomarker levels could be influenced by age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and self-identified race.

Biomarkers are needed to monitor BBB integrity over time, better understand the role of the BBB in neurodegeneration, potentially help define long-term ADRD risk, and monitor effects of therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the current biomarkers used to detect human BBB dysfunction in the context of cognitive decline and dementia. We also discuss promising candidate fluid biomarkers to detect BBB dysfunction in blood. HIGHLIGHTS: BBB permeability occurs during normal aging and is further exacerbated in ADRD. In this review, we discuss in vivo imaging and CSF biomarkers of BBB dysfunction currently used in the setting of aging and ADRD in humans. We also review promising candidate blood-based biomarkers that may represent BBB dysfunction.",Alzheimers Dement
40137277,The Advancements of Marine Natural Products in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Study Based on Cell and Animal Experiments.,"As life expectancy rises and the aging population grows, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a significant global health concern. AD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear etiology. Current hypotheses primarily focus on β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation as key pathological processes. Given the limited efficacy of existing therapeutic strategies, there is an urgent need to explore novel treatment options. Marine natural products have garnered significant attention due to their unique chemical structures and diverse bioactivities, demonstrating potential for multi-target interventions in AD. This review systematically summarizes the roles of marine-derived compounds, including polysaccharides, carotenoids, and polyphenols, in modulating Aβ aggregation, mitigating tau protein pathology, and regulating gut-brain axis dysfunction. Furthermore, the challenges of current research are discussed, with an emphasis on improving blood-brain barrier permeability and optimizing drug delivery systems to facilitate clinical translation.",Mar Drugs
40065483,Understanding Music Participation for Adults With Down Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Adults with Down syndrome are living longer and have high risk of experiencing Alzheimer's disease as they age. With few services available, music is a promising modality that has been shown to support cognitive functioning. This study reported on the frequency of music participation for adults with Down syndrome and explored associations of age, race and level of intellectual disability with music participation.
METHODS: The research team administered a survey to care partners of adults with Down syndrome (n = 27) that measured music participation in terms of 'listening' and 'playing' using the Guernsey Community Participation and Leisure Assessment.
RESULTS: 44.4% of care partners reported providing over 50 h of care a week. 92.6% of adults with Down syndrome listened to music, and 33.3% played music either weekly or daily. 74.1% of care partners reported that adults with Down syndrome could listen to music unaccompanied, and 48.2% of care partners reported that adults with Down syndrome could play music unaccompanied. A statistically significant association was found between race and playing music.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowing that multiracial adults with Down syndrome had a higher frequency in playing music, a potent future research direction is better understanding the musical needs and preferences of these diverse adults. Broadly, those developing services and supports could consider utilizing music as a meaningful activity that does not add care partner burden.

40098109,Changes in dementia risk along with onset age of depression: a longitudinal cohort study of elderly depressed patients.,"BACKGROUND: Depression in late-life is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), with the risk potentially varying according to the age at onset of depression. Previous studies have typically dichotomized depression onset ages between 55 and 65 years; however, the specific age at which depression onset increases AD risk in older adults remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the age at onset of depression and AD risk, and compare the characteristics between different age groups.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort of 251 older patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder was followed for up to 22 years. Participants were categorized into four groups based on depression onset age: ≤ 54 years, 55-64, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years. Annual cognitive assessments were conducted using the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, with further neuropsychological testing when cognitive decline was suspected. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess AD conversion risk across groups, adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: During follow-up ranging from 1.0 to 22.9 years, 75 patients (29.88%) converted to AD. Depression onset after age 75 years was significantly associated with a higher risk of AD conversion (hazard ratio [HR], 8.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.41-23.48; p < 0.0001) and a shorter time to conversion compared to onset before age 55 (40.93 vs. 83.40 months). After adjusting for covariates, depression onset after age 75 remained significantly associated with AD conversion (adjusted HR, 5.20; 95% CI, 1.04-25.93; p = 0.0431). This group also had milder depressive symptoms and a higher prevalence of hypertension and cerebrovascular disease than those with depression onset before 55 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: The onset of depression after the age of 75 years was strongly associated with an increased risk of AD and a shorter time to dementia onset. Individuals with depression onset after age 75 appear more closely linked to vascular comorbidities, while those with depression onset before age 55 are characterized by severe and recurrent depressive episodes. The mechanisms underlying AD in individuals with depression may differ from those in individuals without prior depression.",BMC Psychiatry
40107858,Development of Donor-Acceptor Architecture-Based Potential Theranostic Fluorescent Probes for Alzheimer's Disease.,"The cholinergic deficits and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) species are regarded as the key events contributing to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, a series of novel donor-acceptor architecture-type potential theranostic agents were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their potential against cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes and detection of Aβ species, which are primary targets in the development of therapeutics for AD. The optimal compound/probe 18 containing a benzothiazolium fluorophore with a bifunctional electron-donating N-aryl piperazine scaffold exhibited potent inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE; IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.172 ± 0.011 μM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.376 ± 0.141 μM). Measurement of fluorescence properties showed that probe 18 exhibited emission maxima (λ<sub>em</sub>) of &gt;610 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and &gt;590 nm in PBS, suitable for the fluorescence imaging. In vitro studies demonstrated a change in fluorescence characteristics and high binding affinities (18; K<sub>d</sub> = 0.731 μM) upon binding with Aβ aggregates. The affinity of probe 18 toward Aβ aggregates was further observed in elavGAL4 &gt; UAS Aβ, the Drosophila larval brain sections, using a fluorescence imaging technique. The in vivo acute oral toxicity evaluation indicated a safety profile of the lead probe 18. Moreover, in vivo behavioral studies including Y-maze and novel object recognition tests signified that the administration of compound 18 improved cognitive and spatial memory impairment at a dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg in the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficit model.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40136948,Recent Advances in Electrochemical Biosensors for Neurodegenerative Disease Biomarkers.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent a growing global health challenge with overlapping biomarkers. Key biomarkers, including α-synucleins, amyloid-β, and Tau proteins, are critical for accurate detection but are often assessed using conventional methods like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which are invasive, costly, and time-intensive. Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as promising tools for biomarker detection due to their high sensitivity, rapid response, and potential for miniaturization. The integration of nanomaterials has further enhanced their performance, improving sensitivity, specificity, and practical application. To this end, this review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in electrochemical biosensors for detecting neurodegenerative disease biomarkers, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and future opportunities. By addressing the challenges of early diagnosis, this work aims to stimulate interdisciplinary innovation and improve clinical outcomes for neurodegenerative disease patients.",Biosensors (Basel)
40016624,Association Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the Aquaporin-4 Gene and Longitudinal Changes in White Matter Free Water and Cognitive Function in Non-Demented Older Adults.,"We investigated whether aquaporin-4 (AQP4) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression through changes in the glymphatic system. We included 242 non-dementia participants and chose six SNPs previously shown to be related to AD. We analyzed the associations between AQP4 SNPs and glymphatic markers, including enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), white matter free water (FW), and diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. We investigated whether AQP4-related glymphatic markers are associated with AD pathology progression and cognitive impairment, and whether they mediate the relationship between AQP4 SNPs and AD progression. There was no association between AQP4 SNPs and glymphatic markers at baseline. Carriers of the AQP4 SNP rs72878794 minor allele status exhibited slower FW increase in the amyloid-positive group (SNP*time: β = -0.0040, t(46.25) = -2.062, p = 0.045, 95% CI = -0.0078 ~ -0.0001), whereas the rs9951307 minor allele carrier showed a faster FW increase in the amyloid-negative group (SNP*time: β =0.0033, t(81.19) = 2.245, p = 0.027, 95% CI = 0.0004 ~ 0.0062). The higher FW was associated with faster cognitive decline at follow-ups. AQP4 SNPs influence interstitial fluid accumulation, contributing to cognitive decline but not amyloid deposition in AD. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathways linking AQP4 SNPs and AD progression.",Hum Brain Mapp
40002598,Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease in Human Participants Using EEGConformer and Attention-Based LSTM During the Short Question Task.,"Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder advancing through subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia, making early diagnosis crucial. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to advanced neuroimaging for detecting early neural changes. While most studies focus on resting-state EEG or handcrafted features with traditional machine learning, deep learning (DL) offers a promising tool for automated EEG analysis. This study classified the AD spectrum (SCD, MCI, AD) using EEG recorded during resting-state and task-based conditions. Specifically, EEG was recorded during a simple yes/no question-answering task, mimicking everyday cognitive activities, and was explored. We hypothesized that brain activity during tasks involving listening, comprehension, and response execution provides diagnostic insights. Methods: We collected 1 min of resting-state EEG and approximately 3 min of task-based EEG from 20, 28, and 10 participants with SCD, MCI, and AD, respectively. Task data included response accuracy and reaction time. After minimal preprocessing, two DL models, attention long short-term memory and EEGConformer, were used for binary (e.g., SCD vs. MCI) and three-class (SCD, MCI, AD) classification. Results: Task-based EEG outperformed resting-state EEG, with a 5-15% improvement in accuracy. The area under the curve (AUC) results consistently demonstrated superior classification performance for task-based EEG compared to resting-state EEG across all group distinctions. No significant performance difference was observed between the two DL models. Conclusions: We proposed a cognitive task-based approach for early AD spectrum diagnosis via EEG, offering greater accuracy by leveraging advanced DL models.",Diagnostics (Basel)
40009460,"Uremic Toxins, Chronic Kidney Disease, and Cognitive Dysfunction.","Cognitive impairment involves alterations to one's cognitive status that affects their everyday life. Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and in particular kidney failure, experience higher rates of cognitive impairment compared to the general population. In CKD, 20-70% of individuals have cognitive impairment, but the highest prevalence is described in kidney failure such that dialysis-dependent patients have twice the prevalence of aged-matched controls. In the past 5 years, the number of investigations examining the ""kidney-brain axis"", mechanisms of CKD-related cognitive impairment, and potential therapeutics have exponentially increased. This review article summarizes recent literature on direct and indirect effects of CKD-associated cognitive impairment with emphasis on uremic toxins; brain injury mechanisms; overlap between CKD-associated cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases; and promising therapeutics. Reviewed therapeutic interventions include: AST-120 [indoxyl sulfate absorbent], CH-223191 [aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist], TRAM34 [Kca3.1-specific inhibitor], anakinra [IL-1R inhibitor], marimastat, exercise, supplements, and kidney transplantation. Special focus is placed on translational studies examining uremic toxin-associated pathogenic processes including brain oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and blood brain barrier dysfunction through in vitro and in vivo models of CKD-associated brain injury. Finally, future research directions are suggested including targeting of cellular senescence abundance with senotherapeutics and capitalizing on anti-inflammatory effects of regenerative, cell-based therapeutics (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells and extracellular vesicles), and use of aged murine models. Collectively, CKD-associated cognitive impairment represents a prevalent condition for which remaining knowledge gaps exist, and scientific advancements are needed to preserve cognitive function and improve the lives of in individuals with CKD.",J Am Soc Nephrol
40015644,Structural basis of a distinct α-synuclein strain that promotes tau inclusion in neurons.,"Amyloidoses are predominantly associated with the accumulation of persistent aggregates of a particular protein. For example, the protein α-synuclein characteristically aggregates in Parkinson's disease (PD), while amyloid beta and tau deposits are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, α-synuclein-positive inclusions have been reportedly found in some tauopathies, and vice versa; tau-positive inclusions can be found in synucleinopathies. This suggests that there may be coexistence or crosstalk between these proteinopathies. This coexistence suggests that the simultaneous presence of these misfolded proteins may amplify pathogenic mechanisms. However, the crosstalk between these two types of proteopathies remains poorly understood. We now determine the structure of α-synuclein fibrils that directly promote tau aggregation by cryogenic electron microscopy. Helical reconstruction at 2.6 Å resolution reveals a new α-synuclein fibril polymorph we term ""strain B""; its core is unique, incorporating both the N- and C-termini of α-synuclein. The design of peptides meant to inhibit the formation of this structure demonstrates that the C-terminal domain fragment (D105-E115) of α-synuclein is critical for the formation of ""strain B"" fibrils and may play a key role in its interaction with tau. We hypothesize that the unique structure of pathological α-synuclein significantly contributes to tau co-aggregation and plays a role in the intricate interactions among Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings open new avenues for drug targeting, discovery, and improve our understanding of neurodegenerative pathology.",J Biol Chem
39975919,Crystallized and fluid cognitive abilities have different genetic associations with neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Cognitive function is associated with risk for multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous research on the genetic relations between cognition and psychopathology has largely treated cognitive function as unitary, in part due to a lack of well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on specific domains, particularly crystallized knowledge (Gc). Important domains within the hierarchy of cognitive function, especially Gc, have been underexplored regarding their associations with psychiatric disorders. Here, we parse the genetics of cognitive test performance into components representing reaction time, fluid reasoning, and crystallized knowledge. This multivariate approach that allows us to report results from a GWAS meta-analysis of crystallized knowledge (N ~ 438,000). We then test how multiple neuropsychiatric disorders with established links to cognitive function (Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Alzheimer's Disease) are genetically related to these three cognitive domains, and to a noncognitive factor associated with educational attainment (NonCog). We document specific and heterogenous patterns of genetic associations between each neuropsychiatric disorder and the different domains of cognitive function and the noncognitive factor. Previous reports of genetic sharing between neuropsychiatric disorders and GWAS of aggregate cognitive function or educational attainment have failed identify these substantial differences in which cognitive functions drive these relations for which disorders.",Res Sq
40064874,Berberine-inspired ionizable lipid for self-structure stabilization and brain targeting delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.,"Lipid nanoparticles have shown success in targeting major organs such as the liver, spleen, and lungs, but crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge. Effective brain-targeted delivery systems are essential for advancing gene therapy for neurological diseases but remain limited by low transport efficiency and poor nucleic acid stability. Here, we report a library of ionizable lipids based on the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of protoberberine alkaloids, designed to improve BBB penetration via dopamine D3 receptor-mediated endocytosis. These nanoparticles offer three key advantages: enhanced brain uptake, improved nucleic acid stability through poly(A) self-assembly, and minimal immunogenicity with inherent neuroprotective properties. In murine models, they demonstrate therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease, glioma, and cryptococcal meningitis. This berberine-inspired delivery system integrates precise receptor targeting with nucleic acid stabilization, offering a promising platform for brain-targeted therapeutics.",Nat Commun
40034344,Therapeutic drug monitoring for dose optimization in Alzheimer's disease and in dementia with Lewy bodies: A randomized single-blinded clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests serum concentrations of donepezil varies in clinical populations and that a dose higher than standard may have additional positive effect on cognition. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool for dose optimization (DO) whereby treatment is adjusted based on previous quantification of the prescribed drug.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether TDM-based DO of donepezil or memantine improves clinical outcomes and/or reduce the frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) in neurodegenerative conditions commonly treated with these two study drugs.
METHODS: Single-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled study in an outpatient memory clinic. Eligible participants either newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) scheduled for treatment with donepezil or memantine. The intervention group received TDM based DO. The control group received DO solely based on clinical assessment. Clinical outcomes were change in Mini-Mental State Examination, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Disability Assessment in Dementia from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, data on incidence and severity of ARs and proportion of participants with a serum concentration within the therapeutic reference range were collected.
RESULTS: 132 participants recruited (125 AD, 7 DLB, none with PDD) of whom 107 completed the study (101 AD and 6 DLB), fewer in the control group than planned. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between groups neither for clinical outcomes nor for frequency of ARs.
CONCLUSIONS: TDM based DO did not significantly improve clinical outcomes nor reduce the frequency of ARs albeit important caveats to the results apply.

39991952,Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four-Petal Flower-Like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes.,"Here, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods by using l/d-cysteine-threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands. These had a distinct spiral four-petal flower-like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating ""hot spots"" that produced a potent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The l-Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly twofold stronger SERS response to Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomers and fibrils than the d-Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the l-Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a cut-off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl
