40155777,Plasma p-tau217 and tau-PET predict future cognitive decline among cognitively unimpaired individuals: implications for clinical trials.,"Plasma p-tau217 and tau positron emission tomography (PET) are strong prognostic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their relative performance in predicting future cognitive decline among cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals is unclear. In a head-to-head comparison study including nine cohorts and 1,474 individuals, we show that plasma p-tau217 and medial temporal lobe tau-PET signal display similar associations with cognitive decline on a global cognitive composite test (R<sup>2</sup><sub>PET</sub> = 0.34 versus R<sup>2</sup><sub>plasma</sub> = 0.33, P<sub>difference</sub> = 0.653) and with progression to mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio (HR)<sub>PET</sub> = 1.61 (1.48-1.76) versus HR<sub>plasma</sub> = 1.57 (1.43-1.72), P<sub>difference</sub> = 0.322). Combined plasma and PET models were superior to the single-biomarker models (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, P &lt; 0.01). Sequential selection using plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) and then tau-PET reduced the number of participants required for a clinical trial by 94%, compared to a 76% reduction when using plasma p-tau217 alone. Thus, plasma p-tau217 and tau-PET showed similar performance for predicting future cognitive decline in CU individuals, and their sequential use enhances screening efficiency for preclinical AD trials.",Nat Aging,2025
40166019,"Rapamycin enhances neurovascular, peripheral metabolic, and immune function in cognitively normal, middle-aged APOE4 Carriers: genotype-dependent effects compared to non-carriers.","Rapamycin, known for its anti-aging properties, shows promise as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in APOE4 carriers-the highest-risk group for late-onset AD. Here we show that a 4-week open-label trial of low-dose Rapamycin (Sirolimus; 1 mg/day) significantly improved cerebral blood flow (CBF) relative to baseline in cognitively normal APOE4 carriers (E4(+)) aged 45-65. It also reduced inflammatory cytokines, enhanced lipid metabolism, increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and enriched gut microbiome composition linked to SCFA production. Conversely, non-carriers (E4(-)) displayed stable baseline-to-post-treatment CBF and SCFA and demonstrated different treatment-related patterns of metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects than E4(+). Serum amyloid A and tau remained unchanged for both groups. These findings suggest Rapamycin may counter early vascular and metabolic deficits in E4(+) individuals, with genotype-specific effects. By bridging anti-aging research and AD prevention, this study highlights a novel, safe, and precision-based approach to mitigating AD risk in APOE4 carriers.",Res Sq,2025
39822295,"Plasma biomarkers of amyloid, tau, astrogliosis, and axonal injury in a mixed memory clinic cohort.","INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that blood biomarkers can differentiate dementia disorders. However, the diagnosis of dementia still relies primarily on cerebrospinal fluid and imaging modalities. The new disease-modifying treatments call for more widely applicable biomarkers.
METHODS: Plasma samples (n = 250) from two mixed memory clinic were included. Participants were divided into amyloid beta positives (Aβ+) and Aβ negatives (Aβ-). Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181, p-tau231, Aβ1-42 (Aβ42), Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured by single molecule array.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found among cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD, and nearly all of the biomarkers were able to predict amyloid status. When combining p-tau181 and p-tau231 they predicted Aβ positivity with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75, and when combining all biomarkers an AUC of 0.86 was found.
DISCUSSION: This study supports previous findings on plasma biomarkers, even when investigated in a typical clinical setting in a consecutive, heterogeneous, mixed memory clinic.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study investigated seven plasma biomarkers in a mixed memory clinic, regardless of amyloid co-pathology or atypical phenotypes.These findings support previous promising results on plasma biomarkers, even when investigated in a heterogeneous population.The combination of phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 and p-231 performed only slightly worse than a panel of multiple biomarkers, aligning with previous studies.Plasma biomarkers show potential for future applications in primary care, treatment monitoring, and trial selection.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39960250,The Use of Antihypertensive Medication and In Vivo Alzheimer's Disease Pathology.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the use of antihypertensive medication (AHM) is associated with in vivo Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathologies in older adults with hypertension and examined if the effect differs by drug-class and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the drug.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited participants from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease. Participants comprised both cognitively normal and impaired older adults diagnosed with hypertension (n = 408). All participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessment and [<sup>11</sup>C] Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET) for measurement of cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. Additionally, a subset of participants (n = 120) was subjected to [<sup>18</sup>F] AV-1451 PET to assess tau deposition.
RESULTS: The AHM group (n = 227) exhibited significantly lower Aβ deposition (B [SE] = -0.104 [0.037], p = 0.006) compared to the non-AHM group (n = 181), even after controlling for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4-positivity, vascular risk factors, and mean arterial blood pressure. Further analysis by AHM class showed an association between the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and less Aβ deposition (B [SE] = -0.143[0.049], p = 0.004). No significant relationships were observed between the use of BBB-permeable AHM and Aβ deposition. Additionally, associations between AHM use and tau deposition did not reach statistical significance.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that AHM use may be associated with lower Aβ burden in older adults with hypertension. Further studies exploring the underlying mechanism, particularly related to RASi, may provide insights into new therapeutic targets for AD. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol,2025
40000636,A single-cell atlas to map sex-specific gene-expression changes in blood upon neurodegeneration.,"The clinical course and treatment of neurodegenerative disease are complicated by immune-system interference and chronic inflammatory processes, which remain incompletely understood. Mapping immune signatures in larger human cohorts through single-cell gene expression profiling supports our understanding of observed peripheral changes in neurodegeneration. Here, we employ single-cell gene expression profiling of over 909k peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 121 healthy individuals, 48 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 46 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 27 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 15 with both PD and MCI. The dataset is interactively accessible through a freely available website ( https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/adrcsc ). In this work, we identify disease-associated changes in blood cell type composition and the gene expression in a sex-specific manner, offering insights into peripheral and solid tissue signatures in AD and PD.",Nat Commun,2025
39810256,Exome sequencing reveals a rare damaging variant in GRIN2C in familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its pathogenesis. While early-onset AD has well-established genetic determinants, the genetic basis for late-onset AD remains less clear. This study investigates a large Italian family with late-onset autosomal dominant AD, identifying a novel rare missense variant in GRIN2C gene associated with the disease, and evaluates the functional impact of this variant.
METHODS: Affected and unaffected members from a Northern Italian family were included. Genomic DNA from family members was extracted and initially screened for pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, and screened for 77 genes associated with neurodegenerative conditions using NeuroX array assay. Exome sequencing was performed on three affected individuals and two healthy relatives. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted. Functional analysis was performed using primary neuronal cultures, and the impact of the variant was assessed through immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology.
RESULTS: Pathogenic variants were not identified in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2, nor in the 77 genes in NeuroX array assay. Exome Sequencing revealed the c.3215C &gt; T p.(A1072V) variant in GRIN2C gene (NM 000835.6), encoding for the glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) type subunit 2C (GluN2C). This variant segregated in 6 available AD patients in the family and was absent in 9 healthy relatives. Primary rat hippocampal neurons overexpressing GluN2C<sup>A1072V</sup> showed an increase in NMDAR-induced currents, suggesting altered glutamatergic transmission. Surface expression assays demonstrated an elevated surface/total ratio of the mutant GluN2C, correlating with the increased NMDAR current. Additionally, immunocytochemistry revealed in neurons expressing the mutant variant a reduced colocalization between the GluN2C subunit and 14-3-3 proteins, which are known to facilitate membrane trafficking of NMDARs.
DISCUSSION: We identified a rare missense variant in GRIN2C associated with late-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the role of GluN2C-containing NMDARs in glutamatergic signaling and their potential contribution to AD pathogenesis.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39775036,Temporal trends in mental health terminology in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND: Despite several studies having correlated Alzheimer's disease with mental health conditions, the extent to which they have been incorporated into Alzheimer's disease clinical trials remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the temporal trends in mental health-related terminology in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials as a proxy measure of research interest. Additionally, it sought to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of these terms through pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trend assessment.
METHODS: In this retrospective descriptive analysis, we included 2243 trials with a start date between 1988 and 2022 by searching for the keyword ""Alzheimer Disease"" in the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicaTrials.gov database. A Python program was created to extract and count the frequency of four mental health terms (loneliness, depression, anxiety, and distress) by year and trial status (e.g., completed, active, recruiting). Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the yearly patterns in the appearance of the four mental health terms. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify trial characteristics associated with each mental health term.
RESULTS: Our results depicted a statistically significant increasing trend in three (i.e., loneliness, anxiety, distress) of the four mental health conditions by year. A comparison between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trials showed an increase in the mention of the same three words over time.
INTERPRETATION: These results may suggest a growing awareness of mental health conditions and a greater interest in considering these conditions in Alzheimer's disease trials, particularly after the onset of COVID-19. Future researchers should conduct more in-depth analyses to examine how mental health variables are operationalized in these trials, with consideration for their subsequent success.",PLoS One,2024
40108701,Tau-PET pathology in the subregions of the amygdala and its associations with cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The amygdala plays a role in behavior and emotional response and is vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, yet little is known about amygdala tau accumulation before clinical symptom onset. To investigate whether certain amygdala nuclei are particularly vulnerable to degeneration and might underlie early neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, we aimed to characterize subregional amygdala tau pathology and its correlates associations with established biomarkers of early AD and cognitive-behavioral measures in Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers of autosomal dominant AD.
METHODS: Participants included 25 cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers and 37 non-carrier family members from the Colombia-Boston (COLBOS) Biomarker Study. Measures included 18F-flortaucipir, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning, Trail Making Test, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory. We examined group differences in amygdala tau levels (whole amygdala, lateral nucleus and basal nucleus) and analyzed tau associations with disease markers and clinical measures.
RESULTS: Amygdala tau levels were higher in unimpaired carriers compared to non-carriers. Among carriers, the basal nucleus showed a greater tau burden than the lateral nucleus, and tau accumulation correlated with closer estimated age to clinical onset and increased cortical amyloid. Additionally, tau in both the basal and lateral amygdala was associated with poorer working memory, lower executive function and greater depressive symptoms. However, amygdala tau did not correlate with symptoms of anxiety. Notably, tau levels in the basal amygdala differentiated carriers from non-carriers, with higher predictive accuracy when neuropsychiatric measures were included.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in autosomal dominant AD, tau accumulation in the amygdala begins early in the basal nucleus, while both the basal and the lateral nuclei are associated with early cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms. The nuclei's differential vulnerability to pathology underscores the importance of investigating tau spread within amygdala-associated networks, relative to the early clinical manifestations of AD. This study reinforces the potential of amygdala tau burden as a valuable biomarker for preclinical AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39846180,Dementia and epilepsy without traumatic brain injury among subjects middle-aged females: a population-based case-control study.,"Background: Although the association between dementia such as Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is well established, there are significant knowledge gaps with respect to the perspective of dementia and epilepsy without TBI. Objective: We aimed to investigate the relationship between dementia and epilepsy in a population-based study of patients without history of TBI. Methods: This study included a random sample of 30,715 patients with no history of TBI, including 6143 with epilepsy as the study cohort and 24,572 without epilepsy as the comparison cohort. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR), with 95% confidence interval, for the risk of developing dementia in the two cohorts. Results: Patients with epilepsy but no history of TBI had increased risk of dementia (adjusted HR = 1.84). For patients aged 55-64 years, the adjusted HR for dementia was 4.5-fold higher among females in the study cohort than among males. Additionally, this study revealed that risk of dementia among above 75-year population lowest than other age subgroups (adjusted HR = 1.45). Conclusions: The study demonstrated an association between dementia and epilepsy in the patients who had no history of TBI. The effect was pronounced in patients aged 55-64 years, especially in the female population, suggesting that epilepsy needs to be more intensively prevented and controlled in this age group.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39728026,Unraveling the clinical-pathological correlations of subjects with isolated and mixed neurodegenerative processes in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset.,"Although Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) is the most common pathology underlying clinical dementia, the presence of multiple comorbid neuropathologies is increasingly being recognized as a major contributor to the worldwide dementia burden. We analyzed 1051 subjects with specific combinations of isolated and mixed pathologies and conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis on a cohort of 4624 cases with mixed pathologies to systematically explore the independent cognitive contributions of each pathology. Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) were both associated with a primary clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and were characterized by an amnestic dementia phenotype, while only ADNC associated with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA). In subjects with ADNC and comorbid LATE-NC, Lewy body disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease, the clinical phenotype was usually diagnosed during life as ""Probable AD."" Conversely, the combination of ADNC with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or corticobasal degeneration (CBD) resulted in a mixed clinical picture, with variable features of amnestic dementia, PPA subtypes, behavioral variant FTD, PSP syndrome, and CBD syndrome. These findings elucidate the cumulative effects of mixed pathologies and provide insights into interactions between neurodegenerative pathologies contributing to a variety of clinical dementia presentations.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2025
39877979,Cross-cultural validation of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 as precision biomarkers for amyloid PET positivity: An East Asian study in Taiwan and Korea.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers have improved Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, but data from diverse Asian populations are limited. This study evaluated plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 levels in Korean and Taiwanese populations.
METHODS: All participants (n = 270) underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and blood tests. Plasma p-tau model-derived probabilities of amyloid PET positivity (amyloid beta [Aβ]+) classified participants into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, plasma p-tau217 outperformed p-tau181, especially in cognitively unimpaired participants (area under the curve = 0.921 [p-tau217] vs. 0.769 [p-tau181], P<sub>difference </sub>= 0.022). Including apolipoprotein E status and glial fibrillary acidic protein improved model fit. The negative predictive value of the low-risk group and positive predictive value of the high-risk group were 97.5% and 86.0%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 effectively predict Aβ+ among culturally different Asian populations. P-tau217 performed better, especially in the early stages of AD. Plasma p-tau217-based models reduced intermediate-risk classifications, suggesting fewer amyloid PET scans needed to confirm the diagnosis.
HIGHLIGHTS: The efficacy of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and p-tau181 was analyzed in two Asian populations. Plasma p-tau217 performs better in predicting amyloid positron emission tomography positivity, especially in cognitively unimpaired subjects. Adding apolipoprotein E and glial fibrillary acidic protein to p-tau improved model accuracy. The models from each cohort were confirmed in the other cohort. Plasma p-tau-based risk stratification may reduce the need for confirmatory tests.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40138448,A polymorphism in the BIN1 gene influences its expression and is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease: An integrated analysis.,"BackgroundThe correlation between rs7561528 and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported with varying results, and the potential mechanism of rs7561528 in influencing AD risk remains unexplored.ObjectiveThis study aims to examine the impact of rs7561528 on AD risk and to investigate its potential mechanism.MethodsThis study initially synthesized previously published data to investigate the correlation between rs7561528 and AD risk. Subsequently, an expression quantitative trait loci analysis was conducted to determine whether rs7561528 modulates the expression of BIN1 in human brain tissue.ResultsOur findings revealed that the rs7561528A allele notably escalates the risk of AD in the Caucasian population (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.07-1.28, I² = 33.5%). Similarly, the rs7561528AG genotype also significantly heightens the risk of AD in the same population (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05-1.31, I² = 21.7%). Further analysis demonstrated that the combined rs7561528AA + AG genotype substantially amplifies the risk of AD in the Caucasian population (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.36, I² = 30.0%). Ultimately, we discovered that rs7561528 modulates the expression of BIN1 in human brain tissue.Conclusionsrs7561528 could potentially affect the risk of AD by regulating the expression levels of BIN1 in human brain tissue. This discovery enhances our understanding of novel mechanisms through which rs7561528 may contribute to AD risk.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39809798,Interplay of p23 with FKBP51 and their chaperone complex in regulating tau aggregation.,"The pathological deposition of tau and amyloid-beta into insoluble amyloid fibrils are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Molecular chaperones are important cellular factors contributing to the regulation of tau misfolding and aggregation. Here we reveal an Hsp90-independent mechanism by which the co-chaperone p23 as well as a molecular complex formed by two co-chaperones, p23 and FKBP51, modulates tau aggregation. Integrating NMR spectroscopy, SAXS, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis we reveal the structural basis of the p23-FKBP51 complex. We show that p23 specifically recognizes the TPR domain of FKBP51 and interacts with tau through its C-terminal disordered tail. We further show that the p23-FKBP51 complex binds tau to form a dynamic p23-FKBP51-tau trimeric complex that delays tau aggregation and thus may counteract Hsp90-FKBP51 mediated toxicity. Taken together, our findings reveal a co-chaperone mediated Hsp90-independent chaperoning of tau protein.",Nat Commun,2025
39929442,Sulforaphane: An emerging star in neuroprotection and neurological disease prevention.,"Neurological diseases, including both acute injuries and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, represent major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which require long-term management, present significant challenges in the search for neuroprotective agents with reduced adverse effects and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Sulforaphane (SFN), a bioactive compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, has garnered considerable attention for its potent neuroprotective properties and overall health benefits. Marketed primarily as a dietary supplement, SFN has shown a variety of biological activities and therapeutic potential in neurological diseases. Recent surging studies including ours have highlighted its ability to impede the progression of AD, PD, and cerebral ischemia by fostering neurogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.

40149715,Ramp Sequence May Explain Synonymous Variant Association with Alzheimer's Disease in the Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha (PILRA).,"Background: The synonymous variant NC_000007.14:g.100373690T&gt;C (rs2405442:T&gt;C) in the Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha (PILRA) gene was previously associated with decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in genome-wide association studies, but its biological impact is largely unknown. Objective: We hypothesized that rs2405442:T&gt;C decreases mRNA and protein levels by destroying a ramp of slowly translated codons at the 5' end of PILRA. Methods: We assessed rs2405442:T&gt;C predicted effects on PILRA through quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. RESULTS: Both mRNA (p = 1.9184 × 10<sup>-13</sup>) and protein (p = 0.01296) levels significantly decreased in the mutant versus the wildtype in the direction that we predicted based on the destruction of a ramp sequence. Conclusions: We show that rs2405442:T&gt;C alone directly impacts PILRA mRNA and protein expression, and ramp sequences may play a role in regulating AD-associated genes without modifying the protein product.",Biomedicines,2025

39793768,Elevation of ganglioside degradation pathway drives GM2 and GM3 within amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that accounts for two-thirds of all dementia cases, and age is the strongest risk factor. In addition to the amyloid hypothesis, lipid dysregulation is now recognized as a core component of AD pathology. Gangliosides are a class of membrane lipids of the glycosphingolipid family and are enriched in the central nervous system (CNS). Ganglioside dysregulation has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, but the spatial distribution of ganglioside dysregulation with respect to amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition is not well understood. To address this gap, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was employed to investigate the age-dependent expression profiles of the A-series ganglioside species GD1a, GM1, GM2, and GM3 in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD in which age-dependent amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques develop. This study utilized a dual-resolution approach in combination with whole-brain imaging for comprehensive detection of ganglioside expression across neuroanatomical regions via high-resolution imaging of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus to investigate plaque-associated ganglioside alterations. The results revealed age-dependent changes in the complex gangliosides GM1 and GD1a across white and gray matter regions in both wildtype and APP/PS1 mice. Significantly greater levels of simple gangliosides GM2 and GM3 were observed in the cortex and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in transgenic mice at 12 and 18 m than in age-matched controls. The accumulation of GM3 colocalized with Aβ plaques in aged APP/PS1 mice and correlated with Hexa gene expression, suggesting that ganglioside degradation is a mechanism for the accumulation of GM3. This work is the first to demonstrate that age-related ganglioside dysregulation is spatiotemporally associated with Aβ plaques using sophisticated MSI and reveals novel mechanistic insights into lipid regulation in AD.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39857643,"Human Endogenous Retroviruses and Their Putative Role in Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease, Inflammation, and Senescence.","The human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are ancient exogenous retroviruses that were embedded in the germline over 30 million years ago and underwent an endogenization process. They make up roughly 8% of the human genome. HERVs exhibit many physiological and non-physiological functions; for example, they play a role in the development of many diseases. They have been shown to affect carcinogenesis by modifying the expression of host genes through their functions as enhancers and promoters. Additionally, some molecules derived from HERVs may stimulate the immune system. Recently research has been focused on the effect of human endogenous retroviruses on the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common cause of dementia. AD is also linked to a significant deterioration in quality of life. The article aims to highlight the potential role of HERVs in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and senescence. Moreover, it is estimated that HERVs may be potential targets for diagnosis and therapy of AD.",Biomedicines,2024
39962801,Autopsy-proven patient with corticobasal degeneration presenting with visuo-constructive disorders as initial symptoms: How advanced MRI sequences can help clinical practice.,"BackgroundCortico-basal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative disease typically responsible for cortico-basal syndrome (CBS) or progressive limb apraxia. Half of CBD patients, however, present atypical symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult.ObjectiveWe reported the case of a woman in her late sixties (BM208), an unusual case of autopsy-proven CBD, showing early signs of Benson's syndrome or posterior cortical atrophy. In addition, we compared cognitive performance and atrophy in different brain regions of BM208 with other neurodegenerative diseases patients to highlight clinical signs that could have guided the diagnosis earlier.MethodsWe retrospectively compared BM208 to patients with typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 18, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores between 18 and 24), Benson's syndrome due to AD (n = 3), CBS/progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) syndrome (n = 5), and Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients (n = 3) and a control group (n = 24). All these participants underwent an MMSE, a complete neuropsychological examination and 3DT1 MRI.ResultsAlthough BM208 was more severely cognitively impaired overall, her cognitive performance was more similar to Benson's syndrome patients' cognitive profile compared to CBS patients or any other degenerative pathology (typical AD/LBD). Consistently, although BM208 was more atrophic than all other groups, she showed cortical atrophy that matched a Benson's syndrome pattern more than typical AD or CBS. However, the analysis of subcortical atrophy revealed atrophy of the basal ganglia corresponding CBS cases. Furthermore, visual analyses on sagittal T1 images showed atrophy of the midbrain, characteristic of CBS/PSP syndrome.ConclusionsThese results highlight the additive value of fine-grained MRI subcortical quantification to diagnose non-AD rare neurodegenerative disorders.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

40082954,Probe-dependent Proximity Profiling (ProPPr) Uncovers Similarities and Differences in Phospho-Tau-Associated Proteomes Between Tauopathies.,"BACKGROUND: Tauopathies represent a diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the abnormal aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying the diversity of neuronal and glial tau pathology in different tauopathies are poorly understood. While there is a growing understanding of tauopathy-specific differences in tau isoforms and fibrillar structures, the specific composition of heterogenous tau lesions remains unknown. Here we study the protein composition of tau aggregates in four major tauopathies: Alzheimer's disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
METHODS: We developed an approach for in situ proximity labeling and isolation of aggregate-associated proteins using glass slides with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human postmortem brain tissue, termed Probe-dependent Proximity Profiling (ProPPr). We used ProPPr for the analysis of proteomes associated with AT8-positive cellular lesions from frontal cortices. Isolated proximity proteomes were analyzed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Co-immunofluorescence staining and quantitative data analysis for selected proteins in human brain tissue was performed to further investigate associations with diverse tau pathologies.
RESULTS: Proteomics data analysis identified numerous common and tauopathy-specific proteins associated with phospho-tau aggregates. Extensive validations of candidates through quantitative immunofluorescence imaging of distinct aggregates across disease cases demonstrate successful implementation of ProPPr for unbiased discovery of aggregate-associated proteins in in human brain tissue. Our results reveal the association of retromer complex component vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35) and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) with specific types of phospho-tau lesions in tauopathies. Furthermore, we discovered a disease-specific association of certain proteins with distinct pathological lesions, including glycogen synthase kinase alpha (GSK3α), ferritin light chain (FTL), and the neuropeptide precursor VGF. Notably, the identification of FTL-positive microglia in CBD astrocytic plaques indicate their potential role in the pathogenesis of these lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the suitability of the ProPPr approach in FFPE brain tissue for unbiased discovery of local proteomes that provide valuable insights into the underlying proteomic landscape of tauopathies, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology. This first comprehensive characterization of tau-associated proteomes in a range of distinct tauopathies enhances our understanding of disease heterogeneity and mechanisms, informing strategies for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39778695,Unveiling FOXO3's metabolic contribution to menopause and Alzheimer's disease.,"The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) calls for a comprehensive exploration of its complex etiology, with a focus on sex-specific vulnerability, particularly the heightened susceptibility observed in postmenopausal women. Neurometabolic alterations during the endocrine transition emerge as early indicators of AD pathology, including reduced glucose metabolism and increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition. The fluctuating endocrine environment, marked by declining estradiol levels and reduced estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) activity, further exacerbates this process. In this context, here we explore the potential of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a critical mediator linking metabolic disturbances to hormonal decline. We propose that FOXO3 plays a key role in the intersection of menopause and AD, given its dysregulation in both AD patients and postmenopausal women, modulating cellular metabolism through interactions with the AMPK/AKT/PI3K pathways. This relationship highlights the intersection between hormonal changes and increased AD susceptibility. This review aims to open a discussion on FOXO3's contribution to the metabolic dysregulation seen in menopause and its impact on the progression of AD. Understanding the functional role of FOXO3 in menopause-associated metabolic changes could lead to targeted therapeutic strategies, offering novel insights for managing for this condition.",Exp Gerontol,2025
39741782,Can brain network connectivity facilitate the clinical development of disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer drugs?,"The preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease represents a crucial time window for therapeutic intervention but requires the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers that are sensitive to the effects of disease-modifying drugs. Amyloid peptide and tau proteins, the main histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, have been widely used as biomarkers of anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. However, these biomarkers do not fully capture the multiple biological pathways of the brain. Indeed, robust amyloid-target engagement by anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies has recently translated into modest cognitive and clinical benefits in Alzheimer's disease patients, albeit with potentially life-threatening side effects. Moreover, targeting the tau pathway has yet to result in any positive clinical outcomes. Findings from computational neuroscience have demonstrated that brain regions do not work in isolation but are interconnected within complex network structures. Brain connectivity studies suggest that misfolded proteins can spread through these connections, leading to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease is a pathology of network disconnectivity. Based on these assumptions, here we discuss how incorporating brain connectivity outcomes could better capture global brain functionality and, in conjunction with traditional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, could facilitate the clinical development of new disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs.",Brain Commun,2025
40135662,Pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease: Contrasting the vulnerable locus coeruleus to the resilient substantia nigra.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) selectively affects certain brain regions, yet the mechanisms of selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. The neuromodulatory subcortical system, which includes nuclei exhibiting a range of vulnerability and resilience to AD-type degeneration, presents a framework for uncovering these mechanisms.
METHODS: We leveraged transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry in paired samples from human post mortem tissue representing a vulnerable and resilient region-the locus coeruleus (LC) and substantia nigra (SN). These regions have comparable anatomical features but distinct vulnerability to AD.
RESULTS: We identified significant differences in cholesterol homeostasis, antioxidant pathways, KRAS signaling, and estrogen signaling at a bulk transcriptomic level. Notably, evidence of sigma-2 receptor upregulation was detected in the LC.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight pathways differentiating the LC and SN, potentially explaining the LC's selective vulnerability in AD. Such pathways offer potential targets of disease-modifying therapies for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Intraindividual comparative RNAseq was used to study selective vulnerability. Metallothionein genes are significantly enriched in the substantia nigra. Cholesterol homeostatic genes are significantly enriched in the locus coeruleus. The locus coeruleus is likely more susceptible to toxic amyloid beta oligomers.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39920976,Role of OX/OXR cascade in insomnia and sleep deprivation link Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Therapeutic avenue of Dual OXR Antagonist (DORA).,"Sleep plays a role in the elimination of neurotoxic metabolites that are accumulated in the waking brain as a result of neuronal activity. Long-term insomnia and sleep deprivation are associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, and Lewy body formation, which are known to increase the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB), two neuropeptides produced in the lateral hypothalamus, are known to influence the sleep-wake cycle and the stress responses through their interactions with OX receptor 1 (OX1R) and OX receptor 2 (OX2R), respectively. OX/OXR cascade demonstrates intricate neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and PLC/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway activation. OX1R binds OXA more strongly than OXB by one-order ratio, whereas OX2R binds both OXA and OXB with equal strengths. Overexpression of OXs in individuals experiences sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia-associated MCI, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many dual OXR antagonists (DORAs) have been effective in their clinical studies, with suvorexant and daridorexant receiving FDA clearance for insomnia therapy in 2014 and 2022 respectively. The results of clinical studies suggested that there is a new pharmaceutical option for treating insomnia and the sleep deprivation-AD/PD relationship by targeting the OXR system. DORAs treatment reduces Aβ deposition in the brain and improves synaptic plasticity and circadian expression. This review indicates the link between sleep disorders and MCI, DORAs are an appropriate medication category for treating insomnia, and sleep deprivation links AD and PD.",Biochem Pharmacol,2025
39951680,Unbiased CSF Proteomics in Patients With Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus to Identify Molecular Signatures and Candidate Biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a reversible neurologic disorder that remains poorly understood. Accurate differential diagnosis of iNPH and Alzheimer disease (AD) is complicated by overlapping clinical manifestations. Beyond neuroimaging, there are currently no biomarkers available for iNPH leading to frequent misdiagnosis, and proteomic studies into iNPH have been limited by low sample sizes and inadequate analytical depth. In this study, we report the results of a large-scale proteomic analysis of CSF from patients with iNPH to elucidate pathogenesis and identify potential disease biomarkers.
METHODS: CSF samples were collected through lumbar puncture during diagnostic visits to the Mass General Brigham neurology clinic. Samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Differential expression of proteins was studied using linear regression models. Results were integrated with publicly available single-nucleus transcriptomic data to explore potential cellular origins. Biological process enrichment was analyzed using gene-set enrichment analyses. To identify potential diagnostic biomarkers, decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were applied.
RESULTS: Participants were classified as cognitively unimpaired (N = 53, mean age: 66.5 years, 58.5% female), AD (N = 124, mean age: 71.2 years, 46.0% female), or iNPH (N = 44, mean age: 74.6 years, 34.1% female) based on clinical diagnosis and AD biomarker status. Gene Ontology analyses indicated upregulation of the immune system and coagulation processes and downregulation of neuronal signaling processes in iNPH. Differential expression analysis showed a general downregulation of proteins in iNPH. Integration of differentially expressed proteins with transcriptomic data indicated that changes likely originated from neuronal, endothelial, and glial origins. Using machine learning algorithms, a panel of 12 markers with high diagnostic potential for iNPH were identified, which were not all detected using univariate linear regression models. These markers spanned the various molecular processes found to be affected in iNPH, such as LTBP2, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR), and coagulation factor 5.
DISCUSSION: Leveraging the etiologic insights from a typical neurologic clinical cohort, our results indicate that processes of immune response, coagulation, and neuronal signaling are affected in iNPH. We highlight specific markers of potential diagnostic interest. Together, our findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of iNPH and may facilitate improved diagnosis of this poorly understood disorder.",Neurology,2025
39822290,A longitudinal study of functional brain complexity in progressive Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Cross-sectional resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies have revealed altered complexity with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages. The current study conducted longitudinal rsfMRI complexity analyses in AD.
METHODS: Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were implemented to evaluate altered rates of disease progression in complexity across disease groups.
RESULTS: The LME models revealed complexity of the higher frequency in the CNtoMCI group (those converted from cognitively normal [CN] to mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) decayed faster over time versus CN in the prefrontal and lateral occipital cortex; complexity of the lower frequency decayed faster in AD versus CN in various frontal and temporal regions (p &lt; 0.05 &amp; Benjamini-Hochberg corrected with q &lt; 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Local functional brain activities decayed in the early stage of the disease, and long-range communications were impacted in the later stage. Our study demonstrated longitudinal changes in AD-related rsfMRI complexity, indicating its potential as an imaging biomarker of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted longitudinal resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) complexity analyses using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.Higher-frequency complexity in the CNtoMCI group (those transitioning from cognitively normal [CN] to mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) was found to decay faster over time compared to CN, specifically in the prefrontal and lateral occipital cortex.Lower-frequency complexity was found to decay faster in AD versus CN in various frontal and temporal regions.This study demonstrated that longitudinal changes in rsfMRI complexity could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40145291,Driving research on successful aging and neuroprotection in Latin America: Insights from the inaugural symposium on brain resilience and healthy longevity.,"INTRODUCTION: Global life expectancy has steadily increased in recent decades, resulting in a significant rise in the number of individuals aged 80 years and older. This trend is also evident in Latin America, where life expectancy is improving, though at varying rates across countries and regions.
METHODS: Partnering with the Neurosciences Group of Antioquia (GNA), we launched a Colombian study on resilience in families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and the oldest-old population. Over the past 2 years, the project has expanded to include participants from Peru, Chile, and Costa Rica.
RESULTS: This research led to the first symposium on Brain Resilience and Healthy Longevity, held in Medellín, Colombia, in August 2024.
DISCUSSION: The article summarizes key discussions from the symposium, highlighting the most promising opportunities for brain resilience and prevention research in the region and offering recommendations for future research to promote healthy aging and dementia-free communities.
HIGHLIGHTS: Uncovering the genetic and physiological drivers of cognitive resilience, neurodegeneration resistance, and healthy longevity is essential for maintaining brain function as we age. ""Superagers"" and cognitively resilient individuals from Latin American families with Alzheimer's disease offer valuable insights into brain protection mechanisms. Studying the interplay of socio-environmental and genetic factors in the oldest-old is key to understanding healthy longevity and improving dementia prevention.

39871396,Tau oligomers impair memory and synaptic plasticity through the cellular prion protein.,"Deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau aggregates is a central event leading to neuronal dysfunction and death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Among tau aggregates, oligomers (TauOs) are considered the most toxic. AD brains show significant increase in TauOs compared to healthy controls, their concentration correlating with the severity of cognitive deficits and disease progression. In vitro and in vivo neuronal TauO exposure leads to synaptic and cognitive dysfunction, but their mechanisms of action are unclear. Evidence suggests that the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) may act as a mediator of TauO neurotoxicity, as previously proposed for β-amyloid and α-synuclein oligomers. To investigate whether PrP<sup>C</sup> mediates TauO detrimental activities, we compared their effects on memory and synaptic plasticity in wild type (WT) and PrP<sup>C</sup> knockout (Prnp<sup>0/0</sup>) mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of TauOs significantly impaired recognition memory in WT but not in Prnp<sup>0/0</sup> mice. Similarly, TauOs inhibited long-term potentiation in acute hippocampal slices from WT but not Prnp<sup>0/0</sup> mice. Surface plasmon resonance indicated a high-affinity binding between TauOs and PrP<sup>C</sup> with a K<sub>D</sub> of 20-50 nM. Immunofluorescence analysis of naïve and PrP<sup>C</sup>-overexpressing HEK293 cells exposed to TauOs showed a PrP<sup>C</sup> dose-dependent association of TauOs with cells over time, and their co-localization with PrP<sup>C</sup> on the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments, suggesting PrP<sup>C</sup>-may play a role in TauO internalization. These findings support the concept that PrP<sup>C</sup> mediates the detrimental activities of TauOs through a direct interaction, suggesting that targeting this interaction might be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD and other tauopathies.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
40145301,"Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques.","INTRODUCTION: Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies.
METHOD: We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß).
RESULTS: Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Icosahedral display of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (pT181) Qß virus-like particle surface (""pT181-Qß"" vaccine) induces a robust immune response in mice and in non-human primates (NHPs) pT181-Qß vaccination reduces pathological tau (pTau) and brain atrophy, and improves memory and motor function in PS19 and hTau mice. pT181-Qß vaccination-induced immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) are safe, Th2 skewed (anti-inflammatory), specific to pTau in human AD brain, and efficiently engage pT181 in NHPs and human brain lysate. pT181<sup>+</sup> tau in human plasma correlates with the neurofilament light in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-suggesting the presence of pT181-Qß vaccine target in the early disease state.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40117242,Exploration of small molecules as inhibitors of potential BACE1 protein to treat amyloid cerebrovascular disease by employing molecular modeling and simulation approaches.,"Amyloid cerebrovascular disease, primarily driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, is intricately linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) plays a critical role in the production of Aβ, making it a key therapeutic target. In the current work, a CNS library of ChemDiv database containing 44085 compounds was screened against the BACE1 protein. Initially, a structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis was constructed, followed by virtual screening, with the screened hits docked to the BACE1 protein to determine the optimal binding modes. The docking results were examined using the glide gscore and chemical interactions of the docked molecules. The cutoff value of -5 kcal/mol was used to select hits with high binding affinities. A total of seven hits were chosen based on the glide g score. Furthermore, the possible binding mechanisms of the docked ligands were investigated, and it was discovered that all seven selected ligands occupied the same site in the predicted binding pocket of protein. The bioactivity scores of the compounds demonstrated that the chosen compounds possess the features of lead compounds. The toxicity risks and ADMET features of the selected hits were anticipated, and four compounds, J032-0080, SC13-0774, V030-0915, and V006-5608 were chosen for stability analysis. The selected hits were extremely stable and strongly bound to the BACE1 pocket, and conformational changes caused by RMSD, RMSF, and protein-ligand interactions were assessed using MD modeling. Similarly, principal component analysis revealed a large static number of hydrogen bonds. The MM/GBSA binding free energies maps revealed a significant energy contribution in the binding of selected hits to BACE1. The binding free energy landscapes indicated that the hits were bound with a high binding affinity. Thus, the hits could serve as lead compounds in biophysical investigations to limit the biological activity of the BACE1 protein.",PLoS One,2025
39762659,Monocyte-derived macrophages act as reinforcements when microglia fall short in Alzheimer's disease.,"The central nervous system (CNS) is endowed with its own resident innate immune cells, the microglia. They constitute approximately 10% of the total cells within the CNS parenchyma and act as 'sentinels', sensing and mitigating any deviation from homeostasis. Nevertheless, under severe acute or chronic neurological injury or disease, microglia are unable to contain the damage, and the reparative activity of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) is required. The failure of the microglia under such conditions could be an outcome of their prolonged exposure to hostile stimuli, leading to their exhaustion or senescence. Here, we describe the conditions under which the microglia fall short, focusing mainly on the context of Alzheimer's disease, and shed light on the functions performed by MDMs. We discuss whether and how MDMs engage in cross-talk with the microglia, why their recruitment is often inadequate, and potential ways to augment their homing to the brain in a well-controlled manner.",Nat Neurosci,2025
40088886,Multi-cohort cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identifies robust molecular signatures across the Alzheimer disease continuum.,"Changes in β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precede Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms, making the CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand disease pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies. Using the AT framework and a three-stage study design (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis), we identified 2,173 analytes (2,029 unique proteins) dysregulated in AD. Of these, 865 (43%) were previously reported, and 1,164 (57%) are novel. The identified proteins cluster in four different pseudo-trajectories groups spanning the AD continuum and were enriched in pathways including neuronal death, apoptosis, and tau phosphorylation (early stages), microglia dysregulation and endolysosomal dysfunction (mid stages), brain plasticity and longevity (mid stages), and microglia-neuron crosstalk (late stages). Using machine learning, we created and validated highly accurate and replicable (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status. These models can also identify people that will convert to AD.",Neuron,2025
40166843,Ethics from the Outset: Incorporating Ethical Considerations into the AI Tech Collaboratories' Pilot Projects.,"There is an urgent need to develop tools enabling older adults to live healthy, independent lives as long as possible. To address this need, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratories (AITC) for Aging Research were created to identify, develop, evaluate, commercialize, and disseminate innovative technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to promote healthy aging and to support persons with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). In 2023, AITC pilot grant applicants were required to answer questions about how, if at all, they would safeguard older adults' data privacy and confidentiality, advance health equity, address bias, and protect vulnerable participants.

39865128,Statistical identification of cell type-specific spatially variable genes in spatial transcriptomics.,"An essential task in spatial transcriptomics is identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs). Here, we present Celina, a statistical method for systematically detecting cell type-specific SVGs (ct-SVGs)-a subset of SVGs exhibiting distinct spatial expression patterns within specific cell types. Celina utilizes a spatially varying coefficient model to accurately capture each gene's spatial expression pattern in relation to the distribution of cell types across tissue locations, ensuring effective type I error control and high power. Celina proves powerful compared to existing methods in single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics and stands as the only effective solution for spot-resolution spatial transcriptomics. Applied to five real datasets, Celina uncovers ct-SVGs associated with tumor progression and patient survival in lung cancer, identifies metagenes with unique spatial patterns linked to cell proliferation and immune response in kidney cancer, and detects genes preferentially expressed near amyloid-β plaques in an Alzheimer's model.",Nat Commun,2025
40123238,Differential effects of 2 and 4 weeks repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation inducing neuroplasticity on cognitive improvement.,"BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an efficient intervention for alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the optimal treatment duration for high efficacy remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study investigates the effects of 2-week and 4-week rTMS on neural network plasticity and cognitive improvement, aiming to identify the optimal treatment duration for cognitive impairment.MethodsrTMS was administered to cognitively impaired patients over 2-week and 4-week periods, exploring its effects on cognitive improvement and induced neural circuits. The study also examines the predictive value of these neural circuits for individual treatment responses.ResultsThe 4-week rTMS treatment significantly outperformed the 2-week course in improving cognitive function. Neural activity analysis identified the precuneus as a key region for episodic memory. Changes in brain regions, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and motor network (MN), were associated with cognitive improvements. Baseline functional connectivity in these regions predicted changes in general cognition (r = 0.724, p < 0.001) and episodic memory (r = 0.447, p = 0.022) after rTMS.ConclusionsExtended rTMS treatment enhances cognitive performance in cognitive impairment patients, with the 4-week course showing superior effects. Reduced connectivity in the DMN following rTMS was linked to cognitive improvements. The neural network baseline can predict patients' treatment responses.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39891817,Involvement of CRMP2 Phosphorylation in Amyloid Beta-induced Tau Phosphorylation of Hippocampal Neurons in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a microtubule (MT)-binding protein, regulates MT dynamics and is phosphorylated at Ser522 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Previous studies have shown increased CRMP2 phosphorylation at Ser522 (CRMP2-pSer522) in early AD stages and AD mouse models, where it colocalizes with phosphorylated tau. However, the role of CRMP-pSer522 in AD pathology remains unclear. In this study, we generated double transgenic mice by crossing tau Tg (PS19) mice and CRMP2 S522A knock-in (CRMP2KI) mice, in which S522 of CRMP2 was replaced with alanine to create a phospho-defective model. No significant change in tau phosphorylation was observed in the hippocampus of tau Tg; CRMP2KI mice compared to tau Tg littermates. However, when Aβ25-35 oligomers were injected into the hippocampus, tau phosphorylation was significantly reduced in Aβ-injected tau Tg; CRMP2KI mice compared to Aβ-injected tau Tg controls. These findings suggest that CRMP2 phosphorylation at Ser522 promotes Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation in this mouse model of AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39748415,Cerebrospinal fluid β2-microglobulin promotes the tau pathology through microglia-astrocyte communication in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β2-microglobulin (β2M) has been demonstrated as an important factor in β-amyloid (Aβ) neurotoxicity and a potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, more investigation is required to ascertain the relationship between β2M and glial activities in AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: In this study, 211 participants from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with CSF and Plasma β2M, CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), Aβ<sub>42</sub>, phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) were divided into four groups, stage 0, 1, 2, and suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) based on the National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria. Multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects models, and causal mediation analyses bootstrapped 10,000 iterations were used to investigate the underlying associations among β2M and CSF biomarkers at baseline and during a longitudinal visit.
RESULTS: CSF β2M concentration decreased with amyloid in stage 1 compared with stage 0 and increased with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in stage 2 and SNAP compared with stage 1. Moreover, CSF β2M level was positively correlated with the Aβ<sub>42</sub> (β = 0.230), P-tau (β = 0.564), T-tau (β = 0.603), GFAP (β = 0.552), and sTREM2 (β = 0.641) (all P &lt; 0.001). CSF β2M was only longitudinally correlated with T-tau change. The correlation of CSF β2M with P-tau (proportion = 25.4%, P &lt; 0.001) and T-tau (proportion = 26.7%, P &lt; 0.001) was partially mediated by GFAP in total participants, reproduced in late-life individuals. Furthermore, the astrocyte cascade also partially mediated the pathological relationship between CSF β2M and tau pathology (β2M → GFAP → YKL-40 → P-tau/T-tau, IE: 0.424-0.435, all P &lt; 0.001). Nevertheless, the mediation effects of sTREM2 were not significant. Additionally, there was no association between plasma β2M and CSF biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF β2M is dynamic in AD pathology and associated with neuroinflammation. CSF GFAP might mediate the association between β2M and tau pathology, complementing the existing research on the effect of β2M in AD pathology and providing a new perspective on treatment.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40029638,Sex Differences in Longitudinal Tau-PET in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) predominates in females at almost twice the rate relative to males. Mounting evidence in adults without AD indicates that females exhibit higher tau deposition than age-matched males, particularly in the setting of elevated β-amyloid (Aβ), but the evidence for sex differences in tau accumulation rates is inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether female sex is associated with faster tau accumulation in the setting of high Aβ (as measured with positron emission tomography [PET]) and the moderating influence of sex on the association between APOEε4 carrier status and tau accumulation.
DATA SOURCES: This meta-analysis used data from 6 longitudinal aging and AD studies, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Berkeley Aging Cohort Study, BioFINDER 1, Harvard Aging Brain Study, Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention. Longitudinal data were collected between November 2004 and May 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Included studies required available longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir or [18F]-MK-6240 tau-PET scans, as well as baseline [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B, [18F]flutemetamol or [18F]florbetapir Aβ-PET scans. Recruitment criteria varied across studies. Analyses began on August 7, 2023, and were completed on February 5, 2024.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In each study, primary analyses extracted estimates for the sex (female or male) and the sex by baseline Aβ-PET status (high or low) association with longitudinal tau-PET using a series of mixed-effects models. Secondary mixed-effects models extracted the interaction estimate for the association of sex by APOEε4 carrier status with longitudinal tau-PET. Study-specific estimates for each mixed-effects model were then pooled in a meta-analysis, and the global fixed effect (β) and total heterogeneity (I2) across studies were estimated. This study is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven tau-PET outcomes that showed cross-sectional sex differences were examined across temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.
RESULTS: Among 6 studies assessed, there were 1376 participants (761 [55%] female; mean [range] age at first tau scan, 71.9 [46-93] years; 401 participants [29%] with high baseline Aβ; 412 APOEε4 carriers [30%]). Among individuals with high baseline Aβ, female sex was associated with faster tau accumulation localized to inferior temporal (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06; P = .009) temporal fusiform (β = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04; P = .02), and lateral occipital regions (β = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.06; P = .009) compared with male sex. Among APOEε4 carriers, female sex was associated with faster inferior-temporal tau accumulation (β = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that sex differences in the pathological progression of AD call for sex-specific timing considerations when administrating anti-Aβ and anti-tau treatments.",JAMA Neurol,2025
39720539,Divergent brain solute clearance in rat models of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease.,"Brain waste clearance from the interstitial fluid environment is challenging to measure, which has contributed to controversy regarding the significance of glymphatic transport impairment for neurodegenerative processes. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) with cerebrospinal fluid administration of Gd-tagged tracers is often used to assess glymphatic system function. We previously quantified glymphatic transport from DCE-MRI data utilizing regularized optimal mass transport (rOMT) analysis, however, information specific to glymphatic clearance was not directly derived. To fill this knowledge gap, we here implemented unbalanced rOMT analysis which allows for assessment of both influx and clearance. Dynamic influx/clearance brain maps were derived from rTg-DI rats with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and TgSD-AD rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rTg-DI rats with severe CAA disease exhibited abnormal influx/clearance kinetics, while TgSD-AD rats with a moderate Aβ plaque load exhibited normal transport suggesting that different Aβ lesions and their overall burden differentially impact glymphatic system function.",iScience,2024
40193870,Amyloid β and Tau Oligomers Disrupt Blood-Brain Barrier in a Human Based in-vitro Microfluidic Neurovascular Unit Model (P10-3.011).,"OBJECTIVE: Unravelaing mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD).
BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence supports the idea that neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown are major contributors for AD development. However, the mechanism underlying NVU dysfunction contributing to AD is still not fully understood.
DESIGN/METHODS: A three-dimensional in vitro NVU model was used as a compartmentalized microfluidic device. It contains five cell types in a dynamic and tunable microenvironment, resulting in an in vivo-like response. Each chip contains two fluidic compartments separated by a porous membrane. The vascular compartment is lined with endothelial cells (EC), while the brain compartment contains cortical neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and microglia. Cultured cells on both sides of the porous membrane, provided cell-cell interactions resembling in-vivo microenvironment. We evaluated the toxic effects of Amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) and Tau oligomers (TauO) by adding both to the brain compartment and adding only Aβo to the vascular compartment. Twenty-four hours after the treatment, indicators of permeability were measured using Dextran 3 kDa, and occluding levels.
RESULTS: After 24 hours of treatment, our preliminary data showed that Aβo and TauO produce cytotoxicity as indicated by an increased permeability, compared to the control chips. This toxic effect was supported by a significant increase in the crossing of Cascade Blue 3KDa between the compartments, as an indicator of increasing permeability, as well as a decrease in occludin levels. As the concentration of Aβo increased, a corresponding rise in permeability was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is a human-based in vitro model that offers dynamic cell-cell interactions to investigate BBB function continuously with and without Aβo and TauO as well as discover therapeutic target capabilities. Our preliminary results suggest that Aβo and TauO provoke vascular cytotoxicity, BBB dysfunction and increased permeability.

39963290,Connectome-based prediction of future episodic memory performance for individual amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients.,"The amnestic mild cognitive impairment progression to probable Alzheimer's disease is a continuous phenomenon. Here we conduct a cohort study and apply machine learning to generate a model of predicting episodic memory development for individual amnestic mild cognitive impairment patient that incorporates whole-brain functional connectivity. Fifty amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients completed baseline and 3-year follow-up visits including episodic memory assessments (e.g. Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall) and resting-state functional MRI scanning. Using a multivariate analytical method known as relevance vector regression, we found that the baseline whole-brain functional connectivity features failed to predict the baseline Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall scores (r = 0.17, P = 0.082). Nonetheless, the baseline whole-brain functional connectivity pattern could predict the longitudinal Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall score with statistically significant accuracy (r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.001). The connectivity that contributed most to the prediction (i.e. the top 1% connectivity) included within-default mode connections, within-limbic connections and the connections between default mode and limbic systems. More importantly, these connections with the highest absolute contribution weight mainly displayed long anatomical distances (i.e. Euclidean distance &gt;75 mm). These 'neural fingerprints' may be appropriate biomarkers for amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients to optimize individual patient management and longitudinal evaluation in a timely fashion.",Brain Commun,2025
40012188,Bioactive compounds and dietary patterns in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly, leading to severe cognitive decline and loss of autonomy. The accumulation of amyloid-β peptides and tau proteins in the brain is considered the central pathogenic mechanism, which results in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Various metabolic disruptions, such as chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory processes, further exacerbate the progression of AD. This review, based on literature from PubMed, SciELO, MDPI, and ScienceDirect, evaluates the role of bioactive compounds and dietary patterns, specifically the Mediterranean and MIND diets, in mitigating the progression of AD. These diets, rich in vitamins, flavonoids, carotenoids, and omega-3 fatty acids, have shown potential in reducing oxidative damage and inflammation in the brain, offering neuroprotective benefits. The findings suggest that bioactive compounds such as vitamin E isomers and polyphenols may delay cognitive decline, presenting a promising avenue for future dietary interventions aimed at optimizing the consumption of these compounds to prevent or slow the onset of AD. Further research is needed to determine the optimal doses and combinations of these bioactive compounds to maximize their protective effects.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39686595,Global amyloid burden enhances network efficiency of tau propagation in the brain.,"BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau are crucial biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, interacting synergistically to accelerate disease progression. While Aβ initiates cascades leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles, PET imaging studies suggest a sequential progression from amyloidosis to tauopathy, closely linked with neurocognitive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the complex interactions between Aβ and tau in AD using probabilistic graphical models, assessing how regional tau accumulation is influenced by Aβ burden.
METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Anti-Aβ Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study were utilized, involving participants across various cognitive stages and employing both Florbetapir and Flortaucipir as tracers. Tau standardized uptake value ratio values were harmonized across studies, and participants were stratified into quantile groups based on Aβ levels. A LASSO regularized Gaussian graphical model analyzed partial correlations among brain regions to discern patterns of tau accumulation across different Aβ levels.
RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in tau structure among low, medium, and high Aβ groups in both ADNI and A4 cohorts, with graph metrics, such as small-world coefficient, indicating increased tau efficiency as Aβ burden increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that tau accumulates more efficiently with increasing Aβ burden, highlighting an interplay that could inform development of dual-targeting therapies in AD. This study underscores the importance of Aβ and tau interactions in AD progression and supports the hypothesis that targeting both pathologies could be crucial for therapeutic interventions.",J Alzheimers Dis,2024
40112813,APOE genotype determines cell-type-specific pathological landscape of Alzheimer's disease.,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk modifier for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the APOE4 allele increasing risk and APOE2 decreasing it compared with the common APOE3 allele. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the temporal cortex from APOE2 carriers, APOE3 homozygotes, and APOE4 carriers, we found that AD-associated transcriptomic changes were highly APOE genotype dependent. Comparing AD with controls, APOE2 carriers showed upregulated synaptic and myelination-related pathways, preserving synapses and myelination at the protein level. Conversely, these pathways were downregulated in APOE3 homozygotes, resulting in reduced synaptic and myelination proteins. In APOE4 carriers, excitatory neurons displayed reduced synaptic pathways similar to APOE3, but oligodendrocytes showed upregulated myelination pathways like APOE2. However, their synaptic and myelination protein levels remained unchanged or increased. APOE4 carriers also showed increased pro-inflammatory signatures in microglia but reduced responses to amyloid-β pathology. These findings reveal APOE genotype-specific molecular alterations in AD across cell types.",Neuron,2025

39887916,Predicting conversion in cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment individuals with machine learning: Is the CSF status still relevant?,"INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) helps diagnose the mild cognitive impairment-Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) spectrum. However, ML is fed with data unavailable in standard clinical practice. Thus, we tested a novel multi-step ML approach to predict cognitive worsening.
METHODS: We selected cognitively normal and MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and categorized them on total tau/amyloid beta 1-42 ratios. ML was applied to predict the 3-year conversion with standard clinical data (SCD), assess the model's accuracy, and identify the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in this approach. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out to explore the automated decisional process.
RESULTS: The model achieved 84% accuracy across the entire cohort, 86% in patients with negative CSF, and 88% in individuals with AD-like CSF. SHAP analysis identified differences between CSF-positive and -negative patients in predictors of conversion and cut-offs.
CONCLUSIONS: The approach yielded good prediction accuracy using SCD. However, CSF-based categorizations are needed to improve predictive accuracy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning algorithms can predict cognitive decline with standard and routinely used clinical data. Classification according to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers enhances prediction accuracy. Different cut-offs could be applied to neuropsychological tests to predict conversion.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40033579,Dual-Phase C-11 PiB PET Images for Detecting Tau Pathology in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly, and frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease and tau pathology. Dual-phase <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET detects amyloid deposition and cerebral perfusion changes and may have diagnostic value for identifying tau in CAA.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with probable CAA for dynamic PiB and AV1451 scans. We compared early-phase (0-6 min after tracer injection) and late-phase (40-70 min) PiB PET between the tau(+) and tau(-) groups (based on AV1451 PET) and investigated their diagnostic values for detecting tau.
RESULTS: CAA/tau(+) had lower early-phase temporal PiB uptake than CAA/tau(-) (p = 0.014) and higher late-phase uptake in the whole cortex and temporal and parietal lobes (all p < 0.05). Early-phase temporal PiB SUVR correlated with tau burden (r = -0.34, p = 0.038). Using Youden's cut-off, early-phase and late-phase PET had sensitivities of 55% and 80% and specificities of 85% and 65% for detecting tau, respectively. Combining early- and late-phase scans provided a rule-out sensitivity of 90% and rule-in specificity of 100% for tau pathology in CAA.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual-phase <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET represents a reliable approach for assessing tau and could potentially identify CAA patients for tau biomarker testing.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2025
39980737,Changes in neurotransmitter-related functional connectivity along the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Alzheimer's disease may be associated with early dopamine dysfunction. However, its effects on neurofunctional alterations in the neurotransmission pathways remain elusive. In this study, positron emission tomography atlases and functional MRI data for 86 older adults with mild cognitive impairment Alzheimer's disease (MCI), 58 with mild Alzheimer's disease-dementia and 76 cognitively unimpaired were combined to investigate connectivity alterations associated with the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. A cross-sectional design was used to compare neurotransmitter-related functional connectivity across groups and associations between functional connectivity and cognitive performance. The findings show that the Alzheimer's disease dementia group showed a decline in mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related connectivity in the precuneus but heightened connectivity in the thalamus, whereas the Alzheimer's disease-MCI group showed a decline in nigrostriatal connectivity in the left temporal areas. Acetylcholine-related connectivity decline was observed in both Alzheimer's disease-MCI and Alzheimer's disease-dementia primarily in the temporo-parietal areas. Episodic memory scores correlated positively with acetylcholine- and dopamine-related connectivity in the temporo-parietal cortex and negatively with dopamine-related functional connectivity in the fronto-thalamic areas. This study shows that connectivity alterations in acetylcholine and dopamine functional pathways parallel cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and might be a clinically relevant marker in early Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun,2025
39748839,Understanding recent advances in non-amyloid/non-tau (NANT) biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease.,"UNLABELLED: The Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community continues to make great strides in expanding approaches for early detection and treatment of the disease, including recent advances in our understanding of fundamental AD pathophysiology beyond the classical targets: beta-amyloid and tau. Recent clinical trial readouts implicate a variety of non-amyloid/non-tau (NANT) approaches that show promise in slowing cognitive decline for people with AD. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting held on December 13-14, 2022, reviewed the current state of NANT targets on underlying AD pathophysiology and their contribution to cognitive decline, the current data on a diverse range of NANT biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and the integration of NANT concepts in clinical trial designs. Participants also discussed the current definition of therapies that target underlying AD pathophysiology, what endpoints best define what is considered a meaningful change beyond the current approved definition for clinical efficacy, and how the recent NANT findings should inform the development of future guidelines for AD classification and personalized treatment strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from industry, academia, and government to review the current state of non-beta amyloid and non-tau (NANT) targets on underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology.The totality of scientific and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that emerging NANT targets play a role in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. New biomarkers based on NANT targets must be globally developed and implemented with specific consideration of fluid biomarkers as a cost-effective clinical option, to ensure better, more equitable treatment options for AD.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024

40122182,Loss of excitatory inputs and decreased tonic and evoked activity of locus coeruleus neurons in aged P301S mice.,"Tau pathology in the locus coeruleus (LC) is associated with several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Phosphorylated tau accumulates in the LC and results in inflammation, synaptic loss, and eventually cell death as the disease progresses. Loss of LC neurons and noradrenergic innervation is thought to contribute to the symptoms of cognitive decline later in disease. While loss and degeneration of LC neurons has been well studied, less is known about changes in LC physiology at advanced stages of tau pathology that precedes neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo electrophysiological properties of LC neurons in male and female mice from the P301S mouse model of tauopathy at 9 months of age, a time-point when significant tau accumulation, cell death, and cognitive impairments are observed. We found a reduction in excitatory inputs and changes in excitatory post-synaptic current kinetics in male and female P301S. There was also a decrease in spontaneous discharge of LC neurons and an increase in AP threshold in P301S mice of both sexes. Finally, we observed a decrease in excitability and increase in rheobase current in P301S mice. Despite the decrease in LC activity in ex vivo slices, we did not identify differences in total tissue norepinephrine (NE) or NE metabolites in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. Together these findings demonstrate reductions in the activity and excitability of LC neurons at late stages of tau accumulation. However, compensatory mechanisms may maintain normal NE levels in LC projection regions in vivo.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39730671,Partial microglial depletion and repopulation exert subtle but differential effects on amyloid pathology at different disease stages.,"Colony-stimulating factor-1-receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors have been widely used to rapidly deplete microglia from the brain, allowing the remaining microglia population to self-renew and repopulate. These new-born microglia are thought to be ""rejuvenated"" and have been shown to be beneficial in several disease contexts and in normal aging. Their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thus of great interest as they represent a potential disease-modifying therapy. Here, we explored the differential effects of microglial depletion and repopulation during amyloid pathology progression using 5xFAD mice. We utilized the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 to induce microglial self-renewal and tracked microglia-plaque dynamics with in vivo imaging. We observed transient improvement in plaque burden on different timescales depending on the animal's age. While the improvement in plaque burden did not persist in any age group, renewing microglia during mid- to late-pathology might still be beneficial as we observed a potential improvement in microglial sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling. Altogether, our findings provide further insights into the therapeutic potential of microglial renewal in AD.",Sci Rep,2024
40152909,Neuropsychiatric symptoms in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are not part of diagnostic criteria for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease a few retrospective studies and our clinical experience have suggested they are prominent and often occur early. The objective of our study was to assess prospectively the neuropsychiatric features in sCJD (and their impact on caregivers) and compare them with five other neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was given at the first UCSF research visit to caregivers of 789 serial patients evaluated at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center from January 2000 through November 2016 who met diagnostic research criteria for one of the six neurodegenerative disorders. All subjects also had to have a Mini-Mental Status Evaluation (MMSE) and demographic data (age, sex, years of education). We hypothesized that sCJD has a very prominent behavioral and neuropsychiatric profile, which might help distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases. Of our sCJD cohort (n=92), 97% had at least one NPI neuropsychiatric symptom, and half had at least six of the 12 NPI symptom categories, by their first research visit. The most common behavioral symptoms, occurring in more than half of sCJD patients, were: Appetite/Eating Disorders (68%), Apathy/Indifference (66%), Night-time Behaviors (53%), Aberrant Motor Behavior (53%) and Anxiety (52%). Even the least common behavior, Disinhibition, occurred in 19%. Compared to both DLB and bvFTD -- two conditions with very prominent behavioral features and which include behavior in their diagnostic criteria - -sCJD had significantly higher mean NPI FrequencyxSeverity product scores for Night-time Behaviors and Delusions; sCJD also had significantly higher scores for Hallucinations and Depression/Dysphoria than bvFTD and for Appetite/Eating Disorder, Aberrant Motor behavior and Agitation than DLB. sCJD had significantly worse FrequencyxSeverity scores than AD in three-quarters of NPI categories. Our data show that sCJD is a highly behavioral syndrome. Although no neuropsychiatric symptom is pathognomonic for sCJD, certain symptoms might help differentiate sCJD from some other neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings support the inclusion of behavioral symptoms in sCJD diagnostic criteria.",Brain,2025
39711285,Premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy and Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers later in life.,"INTRODUCTION: Premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) before the age of 46 years is associated with an increased risk of dementia. We investigated the long-term effects of PBO performed before age 50 years on amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging-2 participants were divided into early PBO (< 46 years; n = 61), and late PBO (46-49 years; n = 51) groups and were compared to referent women who did not undergo PBO (n = 119).
RESULTS: Early PBO was associated with thinner entorhinal cortex (p = 0.014), higher tau load at higher levels of Aβ load (Pp = 0.005), higher Aβ load (p = 0.026), and smaller temporal lobe cortical thickness (p = 0.022), only at older ages compared to the referent group.
DISCUSSION: PBO before the age of 46 years is associated with entorhinal cortex thinning, elevated tau at higher Aβ levels, along with an AD-like pattern of atrophy at older ages.
CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT03821857 sex-specific effects of endocrine disruption on aging and AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) before the ages of 46 (early PBO) years and ages 46 to 49 (late PBO) years was studied. Early PBO was associated with reduced entorhinal cortex thickness later in life. Early PBO was associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) load at older ages. Early PBO was associated with greater Alzheimer's disease pattern of atrophy at older ages. Early PBO was associated with higher tau load at higher Aβ levels.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
40014571,S-Nitrosylation of CRTC1 in Alzheimer's disease impairs CREB-dependent gene expression induced by neuronal activity.,"cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and long-term memory formation through the regulation of neuronal activity-dependent gene expression, and CRTC1 dysregulation is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that increased S-nitrosylation of CRTC1 (forming SNO-CRTC1), as seen in cell-based, animal-based, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebrocortical neuron-based AD models, disrupts its binding with CREB and diminishes the activity-dependent gene expression mediated by the CRTC1/CREB pathway. We identified Cys216 of CRTC1 as the primary target of S-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO)-related species. Using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we mutated Cys216 to Ala in hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons bearing one allele of the APP<sup>Swe</sup> mutation (AD-hiPSC neurons). Introduction of this nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 mutant rescued defects in AD-hiPSC neurons, including decreased neurite length and increased neuronal cell death. Additionally, expression of nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 in vivo in the hippocampus rescued synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that formation of SNO-CRTC1 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by attenuating the neuronal activity-dependent CREB transcriptional pathway, and suggests a therapeutic target for AD.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025
39857667,Non-Drug and Non-Invasive Therapeutic Options in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Despite the massive efforts of modern medicine to stop the evolution of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it affects an increasing number of people, changing individual lives and imposing itself as a burden on families and the health systems. Considering that the vast majority of conventional drug therapies did not lead to the expected results, this review will discuss the newly developing therapies as an alternative in the effort to stop or slow AD. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) and its derived Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) are non-invasive therapeutic approaches. Singly or as an applied technique to change the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), FUS and TPS have demonstrated the benefits of use in treating AD in animal and human studies. Adipose-derived stem Cells (ADSCs), gene therapy, and many other alternative methods (diet, sleep pattern, physical exercise, nanoparticle delivery) are also new potential treatments since multimodal approaches represent the modern trend in this disorder research therapies.",Biomedicines,2025
40112319,A systematic review and meta-analysis on the characteristics of transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment protocols for patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition causing dementia. Currently, there has been no established non-pharmacological treatment for cognitive decline in patients with AD. Recent evidence suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be effective as a non-invasive treatment for improving cognitive function in AD.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the characteristics of rTMS treatment protocols for patients with ADMethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search on clinical trials on rTMS for improving cognitive decline in patients with AD, using the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases and performed a meta-analysis according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. To clarify which cognitive domains in AD are improved by rTMS, meta-analyses were conducted on both global cognitive function and on each cognitive domain including verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function. In addition, sub-analyses of the treatment details of rTMS parameters including stimulation sites, stimulation frequency, stimulation intensity, and with/without the neuro-navigation technique and meta-regression analyses adjusting for gender, education, and the number of rTMS pulses were performed.ResultsThe results showed significant improvements in global cognitive function, while no significant findings in verbal memory, processing speed and executive function. No significant results were found in subgroup analysis or meta-regression.ConclusionsTo enrich the evidence for cognitive enhancement in AD with rTMS, the randomized controlled trials using a unified rTMS protocol with a larger sample size are warranted.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39935615,Rural-urban disparities of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: A scoping review.,"UNLABELLED: The rising age of the global population has made Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) a critical public health problem, with significant health-related disparities observed between rural and urban areas. However, no previous reviews have examined the scope and determinant factors contributing to rural-urban disparities of ADRD-related health outcomes. This study aims to systematically collate and synthesize peer-reviewed articles on rural-urban disparities in ADRD, identifying key determinants and research gaps to guide future research. We conducted a systematic search using key terms related to rural-urban disparities and ADRD without restrictions on geography or study design. Five search engines-MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus-were used to identify relevant articles. The search was performed on August 16, 2024, and included English-language articles published from 2000 onward. Sixty-three articles met the eligibility criteria for data extraction and synthesis. Most articles were published after 2010 (85.7%) and were concentrated in the United States, China, and Canada (66.7%). A majority had cross-sectional (58.7%) or cohort study designs (23.8%), primarily examining prevalence (41.3%) or incidence (11.1%). Findings often indicated a higher prevalence and incidence in rural areas, although inconsistent rural-urban classification systems were noted. Common risk factors included female sex, lower education level, lower income, and comorbidities such as diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases. Environmental (12.7%) and lifestyle (14.3%) factors for ADRD have been less explored. The statistical methods used were mainly traditional analyses (e.g., logistic regression) and lacked advanced techniques such as machine learning or causal inference methods. The gaps identified in this review emphasize the need for future research in underexplored geographic regions and encourage the use of advanced methods to investigate understudied factors contributing to ADRD disparities, such as environmental, lifestyle, and genetic influences.
HIGHLIGHTS: Few studies on rural-urban ADRD disparities focus on low- and middle-income countries.Common risk factors include female sex, low education attainment, low income, and comorbidities.Inconsistent definitions of ""rural"" complicate cross-country comparisons.Environmental and lifestyle factors affecting ADRD are underexplored.Advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning and causal inference, are recommended.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025

40078869,Vulnerability of the entorhinal cortex II to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive memory loss and deterioration of cognitive functions. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampal areas (perforant pathway) correlates with cognitive impairment. Pathological processing of tau protein is characterized by post-translational changes such as hyperphosphorylation and truncation, which favour conformational changes within tau. These conformational changes can be regional (dependent on phosphorylation) or structural (depending on regional conformational changes and truncation). Through immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining in hippocampus Alzheimer disease brains and quantification in tissue stained with TG3 antibody and analysed by confocal microscopy, we have been able to demonstrate that TG3 correlates with cognitive impairment. In the process of tangle evolution, TG3 is present in pre-tangle. This epitope of the TG3 antibody was very stable to proteolytic processing by caspase-3; truncation is evidenced by the TauC-3 antibody. The entorhinal cortex showed high sensitivity to neurodegeneration and pathological tau processing.",Brain Commun,2025
39775791,Genome-wide association neural networks identify genes linked to family history of Alzheimer's disease.,"Augmenting traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with advanced machine learning algorithms can allow the detection of novel signals in available cohorts. We introduce ""genome-wide association neural networks (GWANN)"" a novel approach that uses neural networks (NNs) to perform a gene-level association study with family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In UK Biobank, we defined cases (n = 42 110) as those with AD or family history of AD and sampled an equal number of controls. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio of training and testing samples, and GWANN was trained on the former followed by identifying associated genes using its performance on the latter. Our method identified 18 genes to be associated with family history of AD. APOE, BIN1, SORL1, ADAM10, APH1B, and SPI1 have been identified by previous AD GWAS. Among the 12 new genes, PCDH9, NRG3, ROR1, LINGO2, SMYD3, and LRRC7 have been associated with neurofibrillary tangles or phosphorylated tau in previous studies. Furthermore, there is evidence for differential transcriptomic or proteomic expression between AD and healthy brains for 10 of the 12 new genes. A series of post hoc analyses resulted in a significantly enriched protein-protein interaction network (P-value < 1 × 10-16), and enrichment of relevant disease and biological pathways such as focal adhesion (P-value = 1 × 10-4), extracellular matrix organization (P-value = 1 × 10-4), Hippo signaling (P-value = 7 × 10-4), Alzheimer's disease (P-value = 3 × 10-4), and impaired cognition (P-value = 4 × 10-3). Applying NNs for GWAS illustrates their potential to complement existing algorithms and methods and enable the discovery of new associations without the need to expand existing cohorts.",Brief Bioinform,2024
40114424,Associations between the logical memory test story recall metrics and plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in individuals free of dementia.,"Objective: Blood-based biomarkers are valued for their lower cost and less invasive nature, though issues with widespread implementation and accessibility remain. Process-based scores from story recall have been shown to detect neuronal network disturbances typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology more effectively than traditional metrics. This study examined the associations between process-based scores and concurrent plasma AD biomarkers in older adults without dementia, while also comparing them to traditional metrics. Additionally, it also investigated the diagnostic utility of these metrics in detecting plasma p-tau217 positivity. Methods: Data from 416 participants (mean age = 66.6 ± 7) free of dementia were extracted from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Logical Memory Test (LMT) and plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau231, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, GFAP and NfL levels were analyzed. Bayesian regression models assessed associations between plasma biomarkers and both process-based and traditional LMT scores, controlling for the covariates. Results: The best-fitting model for plasma p-tau217 included Total ratio (Tr) and Immediate recall (BF10=573), but Tr showed stronger evidence of association (mean coefficient = 0.208; BFinclusion=14.4) than Immediate recall (mean coefficient=-0.007; BFinclusion=1.7). Tr was also the best predictor of plasma p-tau181 (mean coefficient = 0.144; BF10=10.5) and GFAP (mean coefficient = 0.141; BF10=5.8), outperforming traditional LMT scores. No memory scores were associated with plasma p-tau231 or Aβ42/40 ratio levels. Tr score was the strongest single predictor of p-tau217 positivity (BF<sub>10</sub>=38). Conclusions: These findings suggest that process-based memory scores might be useful in enhancing the detection of neuronal network disturbances associated with AD pathology, especially in settings where biomarker testing is unavailable.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
40034447,Does an Audio Wearable Lead to Agitation Reduction in Dementia: The Memesto AWARD Proof-of-Principle Clinical Research Study.,"BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common behavioral symptom in persons living with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD), especially in the setting of residential care. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions are limited. Memesto is a wearable audio device designed to provide messages and music that can be scheduled or played on demand. The objective of this proof-of-principle study was to quantify whether Memesto can reduce agitation in persons with AD/ADRD.
METHODS: Persons living with AD/ADRD with a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) average score of 4 or greater, one informal caregiver, and one formal caregiver (triad) were recruited from residential care facilities in the Midwest region of the United States. After consent and a two-week training period, the triad was monitored every two weeks from Baseline to Week 10 with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) agitation domain subscale (primary endpoint) and the CGI-S scale (secondary endpoint) with the last observation carried forward. The average score on the NPI agitation domain subscale and the CGI-S scale at Baseline and Week 10 as rated by the two caregivers were compared. A 30% drop in the NPI agitation domain subscale in 50% of the persons living with AD/ADRD was considered a clinically meaningful finding.
RESULTS: Over thirteen months of recruitment, 9 triads were identified in 6 residential care facilities in three Midwestern states. For the NPI agitation domain, 6 of 9 (67%) persons with AD/ADRD had a 30% reduction in the average caregiver ratings at Week 10. No adverse events were identified associated with the use of the device. Device usability was rated as positive based on a survey.
DISCUSSION: This study provided quantitative data on psychometrically sound agitation scales regarding a 10-week treatment course with Memesto after a two-week training period. The results were limited by the inability to recruit the desired set of 20 triads due to disruptions in care and staff at residential care facilities. Further effectiveness testing in a larger cohort with a sham control device is necessary.

39889254,Association of Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer Disease and Neurodegeneration With Longitudinal Intra-Network Functional Brain Connectivity.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) is defined by cortical β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration, which contribute to cognitive decline, in part, by altering large-scale functional brain networks. While cortical Aβ and tau have been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity, it is unknown whether plasma biomarkers relate to such changes. In a healthy community sample of cognitively unimpaired adults free from major CNS disease from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we examined whether plasma biomarkers of AD pathology (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, phosphorylated tau [pTau-181]), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were associated with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity and whether changes in functional connectivity were related to longitudinal cognition.
METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were measured using the Quanterix SIMOA assays. Intranetwork connectivity (3T resting-state fMRI) from 7 functional networks was derived using a predefined cortical parcellation mask for each participant visit. Cognitive performance was assessed concurrently with fMRI scan. Covariate-adjusted linear mixed-effect models were used to determine (1) whether plasma biomarkers were associated with longitudinal changes in connectivity, (2) whether the magnitude of the biomarker-connectivity relationships differed by amyloid status, and (3) whether changes in connectivity co-occurred with longitudinal changes in cognition.
RESULTS: Our primary findings (n = 486; age = 65.5 ± 16.2 years; 54% female; mean follow-up time = 4.3 ± 1.7 years) showed that higher baseline GFAP was associated with faster declines in somatomotor (β = -0.04, p = 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01), limbic (β = -0.03, p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.005), and frontoparietal (β = -0.04, p = 0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01) network connectivity. Amyloid status moderated several biomarker-connectivity associations. For instance, higher baseline NfL was related to faster declines in visual and limbic network connectivity, but only among amyloid-positive participants. Among 421 participants with ≥2 fMRI visits (age = 71.7 ± 11.4 years; 55% female; follow-up time = 3.9 ± 1.6 years), longitudinal changes in connectivity were associated with concurrent declines in cognition; however, these results did not survive multiple comparison correction.
DISCUSSION: Among cognitively unimpaired participants, plasma biomarkers of amyloidosis, astrogliosis, and neuronal injury are associated with declines in network connectivity, particularly among amyloid-positive participants. Major limitations include the lack of inclusion of the sensitive pTau-217 and pTau-231 isoforms and comparative PET biomarkers.",Neurology,2025
40057581,"Longitudinal trajectories of cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric decline in Alzheimer's disease during COVID-19 lockdown in South Korea.","The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its interaction with COVID-19-induced social isolation remains poorly understood. This study investigated the longitudinal trajectories of AD severity on cognitive function, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and examined the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on AD patients in South Korea. In this retrospective longitudinal study, data from 253 adults (aged ≥ 55) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD were analyzed, collected between 2018 and 2022. Participants were classified into four groups based on clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores: MCI, AD-CDR0.5, AD-CDR1, and AD-CDR2. Cognitive function, functional abilities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms, and overall dementia severity were assessed. Linear mixed-effects models, along with mediation and moderation analyses were employed to analyze the data. Significant trajectories of decline in cognitive function and functional abilities were observed over time, with more pronounced declines in higher AD severity groups. The COVID-19 lockdown exacerbated cognitive decline and impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) specifically in the most severe AD group (AD-CDR2). Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) mediated the relationship between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) in the MCI, AD-CDR0.5, and AD-CDR1 groups. A significant interaction between MMSE scores and neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed in the moderate AD group (AD-CDR1), indicating that worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms intensified cognitive decline. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scores increased over time, indicating worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas depressive symptoms, measured by the short geriatric depression scale (SGDS), remained stable over the study period. This study highlights the impact of AD severity on cognitive and functional decline, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown. The mediating role of IADL suggests that maintaining complex daily activities may be crucial in slowing disease progression in AD patients. Additionally, the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms underscores the need for targeted mental health support, especially during periods of social isolation, to mitigate adverse effects on patients and caregivers.",Sci Rep,2025
39716788,"Recent Updates on Alzheimer's Disease: Pathogenesis, Pathophysiology, Molecular Approaches and Natural Bioactive Compounds Used in Contemporary Time to Alleviate Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterised by gradual memory loss and neurodegeneration, is an important risk to global health. Despite the recent advances in the field of neuroscience, the complex biological mechanisms underlying the aetiology and pathology of AD have not been elucidated yet. The development of amyloid-beta plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation have been identified as important components. The genesis of AD has been illuminated by advances in molecular techniques, which have shown the contributions of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic variables. Ongoing research is focused on the potential of bioactive compounds as therapeutic agents. Quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, huperzine A, ginsenosides, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, zinc, bacosides from brahmi, and withanolide A from ashwagandha are among the compounds that have demonstrated encouraging effects in modifying disease pathways. These bioactive substances demonstrate their potential for symptomatic relief by providing neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive-enhancing properties. The present review presents the recent findings on AD pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms, and the impact of natural compounds, offering a comprehensive perspective on current and emerging strategies for managing this debilitating condition.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
39791198,Sex-specific association of comorbid heart failure on mortality after Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in older adults aged 75 years and above: A health insurance claims data analysis in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Research on the influence of heart failure on mortality after Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between comorbid heart failure and mortality following Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, particularly considering sex differences.
METHODS: We analyzed administrative claims data from Japan, involving 32,363 individuals (11,064 men and 21,299 women) aged 75 or older newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, with 7% having comorbid heart failure. Cox proportional hazard models and population attributable fractions (PAFs) were used to evaluate the association between comorbid heart failure and mortality within one year following Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
RESULTS: Individuals with Alzheimer's disease and heart failure had a multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-1.73) for mortality during the one-year follow-up period compared to those with Alzheimer's disease and without heart failure. Subgroup analysis by sex revealed a higher mortality hazard ratio in women of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.36-1.95) than that in men of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.13-1.71). Further age and sex subgroup analysis indicated that women across all age brackets-75-79, 80-84, and ≥ 85 years-had higher mortality hazard ratios. The PAF for heart failure increased with age in both sexes, with women having higher PAFs than men, and the sex difference in PAF being most pronounced in the 75-79 age category (men: 1.4%, women: 4.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Hazard ratios and PAFs for mortality associated with comorbid heart failure in newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease are higher in women than in men, which persists across all age subgroups.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40164887,3-(3-(diethylamino)propyl)-2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)thiazolidin-4-one Attenuates Scopolamine-induced Cognitive Impairment in Rats: Insights Into Neuroprotective Effects.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by memory decline, dysregulation in cholinergic and purinergic signaling, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Current treatments are limited, highlighting the need for new compounds to prevent or delay AD progression. Thiazolidinones have emerged as promising candidates due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticholinesterase properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3-(3-(diethylamino)propyl)-2-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)thiazolidin-4-one (DS27) in a rat model of scopolamine-induced memory deficits. Male rats were divided into groups: I - Control, II - Scopolamine (SCO) (1 mg/kg), III - SCO and DS27 (5 mg/kg), IV - SCO and DS27 (10 mg/kg), V - SCO and donepezil (5 mg/kg). The animals were treated orally with DS27 or donepezil for seven days. On the 8th day, they underwent the open field test and inhibitory avoidance training, followed by intraperitoneal administration SCO. Twenty-four hours later, an inhibitory avoidance test was conducted. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory and purinergic parameters were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, lymphocytes, and liver. DS27 prevented memory deficits, alterations in AChE activity, and oxidative damage induced by SCO in brain structures. Additionally, DS27 prevented SCO-induced decrease in IL-10 levels, and increase in IL-6, and TNF-α expression in the cerebral cortex, and normalized ATP and ADP hydrolysis in cerebrospinal fluid and lymphocytes. DS27 did not induce oxidative stress in the liver or alter serum biochemical parameters. These findings suggest that DS27 has significant neuroprotective properties and could be a promising alternative for treating neurodegenerative diseases like AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39936411,Age- and Genotype-Dependent Effects of Chronic Nicotine on Presenilin1/2 Double Knockout Mice: From Behavior to Molecular Pathways.,"INTRODUCTION: The potential therapeutic role of nicotine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial, particularly regarding its age-dependent effects and underlying mechanisms.
METHOD: This study investigated the impact of chronic nicotine administration on cognitive function and molecular pathways in Presenilin 1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice, an amyloid-β-independent model of AD. Three-month-old and eight-month-old DKO and wild-type (WT) mice received oral nicotine treatment (100 μg/ml) for three months. Behavioral assessments revealed that while the 6-month-old cohort showed no significant differences between nicotine-treated and control groups regardless of genotype, nicotine improved contextual fear memory in 11-month-old DKO mice but impaired nest-building ability and cued fear memory in age-matched WT controls. Transcriptome analysis of the prefrontal cortex identified distinct molecular responses to nicotine between genotypes.
RESULT: In DKO mice, nicotine modulated neuropeptide signaling and reduced astrocyte activation, while in WT mice, it disrupted cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and neuroactive ligand- receptor interaction pathways. Western blot analysis revealed that nicotine treatment significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and GFAP expression in 11-month-old DKO mice, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing decreased astrocyte activation in multiple brain regions.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that nicotine's effects on cognition and molecular pathways are both age- and genotype-dependent, suggesting its therapeutic potential may be limited to specific stages of neurodegeneration while potentially having adverse effects in healthy aging brains.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
39814522,Research Attitudes Questionnaire scores and retention in a recruitment registry.,"BACKGROUND: Recruitment registries are maximally effective when registrants are retained to the point of referral. The Research Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ) has previously been shown to predict research participation behaviors, including Alzheimer's disease clinical trial completion.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that RAQ score is associated with retention behaviors in a local recruitment registry.
METHODS: Using data from the UC Irvine Consent-to-Contact Registry, a recruitment registry that enrolls adults 18 years and older, we used logistic regression to quantify the association of RAQ score and the odds of first-year non-renewal. Covariates included demographic variables, comorbidities, and recruitment source. In longitudinal analyses, we used discrete proportional hazards and Cox proportional hazards models to quantify the relationship between RAQ score and time to non-renewal and time to active withdrawal, respectively.
RESULTS: Among n = 4663 participants, we estimated that a 5-point higher baseline RAQ score was associated with a 15% lower odds of first-year non-renewal, after adjustment for potential confounding factors (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: (0.79, 0.92), p < 0.001). Older age and higher education were also associated with lower odds of non-renewal while Asian race, Hispanic ethnicity, and certain recruitment sources (e.g., doctor or friend referral) were associated with higher odds of non-renewal. Higher baseline RAQ and higher annually updated RAQ were both significantly associated with lower odds of non-renewal longitudinally. Age, education, and some recruitment sources, but not RAQ, were associated with active withdrawal.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist to identify predictors of registry retention behaviors and possible targets for intervention to improve related outcomes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39753133,Anti-herpetic tau preserves neurons via the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis relies on the presence of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between AD pathologies and infectious agents, with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) being a leading candidate. Our investigation, using metagenomics, mass spectrometry, western blotting, and decrowding expansion pathology, detects HSV-1-associated proteins in human brain samples. Expression of the herpesvirus protein ICP27 increases with AD severity and strongly colocalizes with p-tau but not with Aβ. Modeling in human brain organoids shows that HSV-1 infection elevates tau phosphorylation. Notably, p-tau reduces ICP27 expression and markedly decreases post-infection neuronal death from 64% to 7%. This modeling prompts investigation into the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway products, nuclear factor (NF)-κB and IRF-3, which colocalizes with ICP27 and p-tau in AD. Furthermore, experimental activation of STING enhances tau phosphorylation, while TBK1 inhibition prevents it. Together, these findings suggest that tau phosphorylation acts as an innate immune response in AD, driven by cGAS-STING.",Cell Rep,2025
40008329,Amyloid-β deposition predicts oscillatory slowing of magnetoencephalography signals and a reduction of functional connectivity over time in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"With the ongoing developments in the field of anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer's disease, it is crucial to better understand the longitudinal associations between amyloid-β deposition and altered network activity in the living human brain. We included 110 cognitively unimpaired individuals (67.9 ± 5.7 years), who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]flutemetamol (amyloid-β)-PET imaging and resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording at baseline and 4-year follow-up. We tested associations between baseline amyloid-β deposition and MEG measures (oscillatory power and functional connectivity). Next, we examined the relationship between baseline amyloid-β deposition and longitudinal MEG measures, as well as between baseline MEG measures and longitudinal amyloid-β deposition. Finally, we assessed associations between longitudinal changes in both amyloid-β deposition and MEG measures. Analyses were performed using linear mixed models corrected for age, sex and family. At baseline, amyloid-β deposition in orbitofrontal-posterior cingulate regions (i.e. early Alzheimer's disease regions) was associated with higher theta (4-8 Hz) power (β = 0.17, P &lt; 0.01) in- and lower functional connectivity [inverted Joint Permutation Entropy (JPE<sub>inv</sub>) theta, β = -0.24, P &lt; 0.001] of these regions, lower whole-brain beta (13-30 Hz) power (β = -0.13, P &lt; 0.05) and lower whole-brain functional connectivity (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.18, P &lt; 0.001). Whole-brain amyloid-β deposition was associated with higher whole-brain theta power (β = 0.17, P &lt; 0.05), lower whole-brain beta power (β = -0.13, P &lt; 0.05) and lower whole-brain functional connectivity (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.21, P &lt; 0.001). Baseline amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions also predicted future oscillatory slowing, reflected by increased theta power over time in early Alzheimer's disease regions and across the whole brain (β = 0.11, β = 0.08, P &lt; 0.001), as well as decreased whole-brain beta power over time (β = -0.04, P &lt; 0.05). Baseline amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions also predicted a reduction in functional connectivity between these regions and the rest of the brain over time (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.07, P &lt; 0.05). Baseline whole-brain amyloid-β deposition was associated with increased whole-brain theta power over time (β = 0.08, P &lt; 0.01). Baseline MEG measures were not associated with longitudinal amyloid-β deposition. Longitudinal changes in amyloid-β deposition in early Alzheimer's disease regions were associated with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of early Alzheimer's disease regions (JPE<sub>inv</sub> theta, β = -0.19, P &lt; 0.05) and the whole brain [corrected amplitude envelope correlations alpha (8-13 Hz), β = -0.22, P &lt; 0.05]. Finally, longitudinal changes in whole-brain amyloid-β deposition were associated with longitudinal changes in whole-brain relative theta power (β = 0.21, P &lt; 0.05). Disruptions of oscillatory power and functional connectivity appear to represent early functional consequences of emerging amyloid-β deposition in cognitively unimpaired individuals. These findings suggest a role for neurophysiology in monitoring disease progression and potential treatment effects in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun,2025
40138441,Investigation of risk of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and survival based on variation to life experiences used to operationalize cognitive reserve.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease dementia (AD) is a debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disease. Life experiences are hypothesized to build cognitive reserve (CR), a theoretical construct associated with delayed onset of AD symptoms. While CR is a key moderator of cognitive decline, operationalization of CR is varied resulting in inconsistencies within the literature.ObjectiveThis study explored the relationship between life experiences used as proxies of CR and risk of AD diagnosis and death following diagnosis.MethodsWe explored results based on 30 different published CR operationalizations, including two standardized questionnaires and an investigator-developed lifecourse indicator. Using data from the Memory and Aging Project, we applied Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the impact of operationalization on time to outcomes.ResultsHazard ratios, indicating instantaneous risk of AD or death for a standard deviation increase in the CR proxy utilized as a predictor, ranged from 0.80-1.40 for AD diagnosis and 0.80-1.29 for death following diagnosis. Among nine predictors that showed a significant reduction in risk of AD, there was a decrease of between 12% and 20%. Two predictors were associated with reduced risk of death, with 13%-20% reduction, while three predictors were associated with 18%-22% heightened risk of death following diagnosis.ConclusionsModel results were highly sensitive to CR operationalization. Based on the variation in results, composite measures that incorporate multiple lifecourse variables may still be the most comprehensive and faithful representation of CR. Attention to methodology and refining of measurement are needed to make use of CR and promote healthy aging.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39878107,Extracellular Vesicles: A Promising Therapeutic Approach to Alzheimer's Disease.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membranous particles that are secreted by various cell types and play a critical role in intercellular communication. Their unique properties and remarkable ability to deliver bioactive cargo to target cells have made them promising tools in the treatment of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks, such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Despite extensive research, no disease-modifying therapy for AD is currently available. However, EVs have emerged as a potential therapeutic agent in AD due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, deliver bioactive cargo, and modulate neuroinflammation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on the role of EVs in AD and discusses their potential as a therapeutic approach. It covers the mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic targets, and challenges and limitations of EV-based therapies for AD.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
39988964,Patterns of sick leave and unemployment prior to a diagnosis of young onset Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Early symptoms in young onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) may be misinterpreted, causing delayed diagnosis. This population-based study aimed to map adverse occupational events preceding YOAD diagnosis as potential prodromal signs.
METHODS: In a register-based, incidence density matched nested case-control study, we examined unemployment and long-term sick leave among individuals diagnosed with YOAD in Danish memory clinics between 2016 and 2022 compared to controls over a 13-year period. Conditional logistic regression produced incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
RESULTS: The study included 2434 cases and 12,170 controls. YOAD patients had higher rates of adverse occupational events, particularly long-term sick leave, starting from 8 years before diagnosis (IRR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.84) and increasing to an IRR of 29.59 (95% CI 18.97-46.13) in the year before diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Adverse occupational events may serve as warning signs of YOAD. Timely diagnosis could facilitate restructuring the remaining working life to accommodate cognitive deficits or in seeking a disability pension.
HIGHLIGHTS: This is a retrospective, nested case-control study of young onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD). Unemployment rates rise significantly 5 years before the YOAD diagnosis. Long-term sick leave rates rise significantly 8 years before the YOAD diagnosis. This emphasizes the importance of occupational history in the timely diagnosis of YOAD. Findings suggest the need for earlier YOAD diagnosis for work-life management.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39702464,Longitudinal trajectory of plasma p-tau217 in cognitively unimpaired subjects.,"BACKGROUND: The advent of Alzheimer's disease-modifying drugs requires accurate biological diagnosis to identify candidates for these therapies. So far, the most promising single plasma biomarker is phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217). To understand its biological features, it is essential to know its longitudinal trajectory and factors influencing it in cognitively unimpaired subjects with no brain pathology.
METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal plasma p-tau217 values (mean follow-up time = 768.3 days) in a cohort of 209 healthy volunteers. We have studied factors associated with plasma p-tau217 changes by using different linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: In amyloid-negative cognitively healthy subjects (n = 151) carriers of ApoE ε4 allele had significantly higher p-tau217 values than non-carriers (0.85 pg/mL; p-value < 0.001) and also a greater rate of change (0.01 pg/mL/year; p-value < 0.001). In the overall sample, including subjects with amyloid and tau pathology we have seen that amyloid positive subjects had higher predicted baseline plasma p-tau217 values than amyloid negative subjects (0.16 pg/mL; p-value < 0.001) and a greater rate of change (0.00004 pg/mL/day; p-value < 0.001). Subjects considered tau positive also showed a greater rate of change of p-tau217 with respect to tau negative (0.00005 pg/mL/day; p-value < 0.001). A + T + N + participants showed a higher baseline p-tau217 levels than A-T-N- subjects (0.2 pg/mL; p-value < 0.001) and also a greater rate of change (0.00006 pg/mL/day; p-value = 0.002). ApoE ε4 carriers had a greater rate of change than non-carriers (0.00003 pg/mL/day; p-value = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: In amyloid-negative cognitively unimpaired subjects, ApoE4 status influenced both baseline levels and rate of change of plasma p-tau217. Other factors such as age, sex or glomerular filtration rate have not shown significant influence on plasma p-tau217 levels in this group.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39956962,Association between plasma cytokine levels and multiple neuroimaging modalities in mild cognitive impairment.,"BackgroundThe relationship between peripheral cytokines and neuroimaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not yet well established.ObjectiveTo determine the association of cytokine plasma levels with brain amyloid deposition, cortical glucose metabolism, hippocampal volume, and white matter lesions (WMLs) in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).MethodsWe recruited 50 older individuals with amnestic MCI (25 men and 25 women; median age, 75 years) and performed plasma analysis, <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron-emission tomography (PiB-PET), <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Global PiB and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake were assessed by the ratio of the voxel number-weighted average of the mean uptake in the frontal, temporoparietal, and posterior cingulate, in reference to the cerebellum. The Fazekas scale was used to evaluate WMLs. Plasma levels of 48 cytokines were simultaneously measured with bead-based multiplex assays.ResultsThe plasma levels of IL-2Ra, IL-3, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, IL-16, IL-18, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-basic), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine (CTACK), growth-regulated oncogene α (GROα), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interferon-α2 (IFN-α2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), β-nerve growth factor (β-NGF), stem cell factor (SCF), stem cell growth factor-β (SCGF-β), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were significantly associated with global PiB uptake, whereas those of IL-7 and GROα were significantly associated with hippocampal volume after covariate adjustment and false discovery rate correction.ConclusionsPlasma cytokines are associated with brain amyloid deposition rather than brain dysfunction or hippocampal atrophy. Moreover, cytokines may play important roles in early-stage AD pathophysiology.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40069380,Examining the effects of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields on cognitive functions and functional brain markers in aged mice.,"Extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) are ubiquitously present in various environments of everyday life. While surveys from the World Health Organization (WHO) have not demonstrated the existence of ELF-MF-induced harmful consequences in healthy subjects, whether older adults are more vulnerable to the effects of residential and occupational ELF-MF exposure, and therefore may be at risk, remains unsettled. Here, we explored this potential health issue by investigating, in aged mice, the effects of chronic exposure to ELF-MFs (50 Hz ELF-MF at 1 mT for 8 h/day, 5 days/week for 12 consecutive weeks) on cognitive functions and expression profile of brain markers typically associated with aggravated aging or the development of Alzheimer`s disease (AD). Sham-exposed mice showed a significant age-related decline in spatial memory functions compared to young adult mice. However, this expected pattern was neither exacerbated nor counteracted by chronic exposure to ELF-MFs. No difference in hippocampal expression of APP-695, Aβ<sub>(1-42)</sub>, S100b and GFAP proteins or in the pTau/Tau ratio was observed between sham- and ELF-MF-exposed aged mice, suggesting that chronic exposure to ELF-MFs does not aggravate aging and associated neuroinflammation, or promote pathological pathways involved in the initiation of AD. Because care should be taken in extrapolating these results to older adults with various comorbidities, applying current exposure limits to existing or new sensitive ELF-MF locations is recommended.",Sci Rep,2025
40091557,Synergistic associations of amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau with tau aggregation and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundThe pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) forming neurofibrillary tangles. Understanding the pathophysiological cascade related to Aβ and tau process is crucial.ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau on tau pathology and cognitive decline in AD.MethodsWe analyzed 319 older individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who underwent Aβ (<sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir or <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET scans, along with CSF and cognitive assessments. Aβ positivity (A+) was determined by global standardized uptake value ratio thresholds of ≥1.11 for <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir or ≥1.08 for <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben, while p-tau positivity (T+) was defined as CSF p-tau181 levels ≥23 pg/ml. Linear mixed regression models were used to assess the effects of PET Aβ and CSF p-tau181 levels on tau accumulation in predefined Braak regions and cognitive function over time.ResultsOur results revealed significant differences in PET tau pathology and cognitive decline between A + and A- individuals. We observed that interactions between Aβ and p-tau proteins were associated with tau accumulation and cognitive decline. Additionally, A-/T + individuals exhibited higher levels of tau accumulation in all Braak regions compared to A-/T- counterparts, suggesting a potential independent role of p-tau in tau pathology in the absence of Aβ.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that Aβ positivity and elevated CSF p-tau181 levels were associated with tau accumulation and cognitive decline, highlighting the relevance of soluble p-tau as a potential biomarker for further investigation.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39732859,Comprehension of acoustically degraded emotional prosody in Alzheimer's disease and primary progressive aphasia.,"Previous research suggests that emotional prosody perception is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). However, no previous research has investigated emotional prosody perception in these diseases under non-ideal listening conditions. We recruited 18 patients with AD, and 31 with PPA (nine logopenic (lvPPA); 11 nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA) and 11 semantic (svPPA)), together with 24 healthy age-matched individuals. Participants listened to speech stimuli conveying three emotions in clear and noise-vocoded forms and had to identify the emotion being conveyed. We then conducted correlation analyses between task performance and measures of socio-emotional functioning. All patient groups showed significant impairments in identifying clear emotional prosody compared to healthy individuals. These deficits were exacerbated under noise-vocoded conditions, with all patient groups performing significantly worse than healthy individuals and patients with lvPPA performing significantly worse than those with svPPA. Significant correlations with social cognition measures were observed more consistently for noise-vocoded than clear emotional prosody comprehension. These findings open a window on a dimension of real-world emotional communication that has often been overlooked in dementia, with particular relevance to social cognition, and begin to suggest a novel candidate paradigm for investigating and quantifying this systematically.",Sci Rep,2024

METHODS: We launched an innovative behavioral healthcare delivery model in collaboration with primary care for Medicare Advantage recipients with SMI, substance use disorders (SUD), and dementia. All patients completed an intake with an MD/NP and were offered screening for HRSN at entry using the Accountable Health Communities HRSN tool. Primary diagnosis was assigned and categorized into SMI/SUD/dementia and non-SMI. Logistic regression was used to quantify the odds of food, housing, and transportation insecurity explained by SMI/SUD/dementia versus non-SMI behavioral health conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 2301 patients completed an intake from January 2023 to March 2024. Moderate/severe depression (40%) was the most common primary target condition at intake, followed by dementia/Alzheimer's disease (12%) and bipolar disorder (5%). The rates of housing insecurity, food insecurity, and transportation insecurity were 27%, 30%, and 21%, respectively. Within our sample of Medicare Advantage participants in Florida, patients with SMI/SUD/dementia were 1.42 times (p < 0.05) and 1.58 times (p < 0.01) more likely to report housing insecurity and food insecurity, respectively, when compared with those with mild/moderate behavioral health conditions.
CONCLUSION: Author Health provides a blueprint for behavioral health services that remove barriers and provide tenacious, consistent, and whole-person virtual-first behavioral health care tailored to the unique needs of older adults. Our sample of Medicare Advantage participants in Florida suggests SMI/SUD/dementia may be a predictor for HRSN independent of socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity.",J Am Geriatr Soc,2025
39814528,Ethnic and racial influences on blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about confounding factors influencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood biomarker concentrations.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to explore the available evidence for the influences of ethnicity and race on AD blood biomarker concentrations.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science databases spanning from inception until 15 June 2023. We included studies that utilized plasma or serum biomarkers (amyloid-β [Aβ], total tau [t-tau], phosphorylated tau [p-tau], neurofilament light [NfL], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), compared individuals with AD to healthy controls, and included a minimum of two ethnic or racial groups for comparison. A total of 10 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. All studies were conducted in the US.
RESULTS: Seven studies reported differences in blood biomarker concentrations between ethnic or racial groups. However, after adjusting for medical conditions and social determinants of health, the differences became non-significant in two of the studies. The included studies differed in their included covariates and their statistical approaches, which complicated the interpretation of the observed differences.
CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that ethnicity and race may influence blood biomarker concentrations. However, it remains unclear to what extent these differences are mediated by differences in social determinants of health and medical conditions. Future studies are needed to explore ethnic and racial differences in blood biomarkers, including studies in diverse samples outside the US.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39873362,Di Huang Yi Zhi Fang improves cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice by inducing neuronal mitochondrial autophagy through the PINK1-parkin pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible age-related neurodegenerative condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles. Di Huang Yi Zhi (DHYZ) formula, a traditional Chinese herbal compound comprising several prescriptions, demonstrates properties that improve cognitive abilities in clinical. Nonetheless, its molecular mechanisms on treating AD through improving neuron cells mitochondria function have not been deeply investigated.
OBJECTIVE: This study administered DHYZ to APP/PS1 mice to explore its potential therapeutic mechanisms in AD treatment.
METHODS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice were given DHYZ (L, M, H), donepezil, or distilled water for a consecutive 12-week period. The Morris water maze test was used to assess memory capacity, transmission electron microscopy was used to observe mitochondrial and synaptic structures, immunohistochemistry and western blot detected proteins involved in the mitochondrial autophagy pathway, ELISA measured serum Aβ content, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assessed neuronal cell apoptosis.
RESULTS: DHYZ demonstrates a notable therapeutic impact on mice with AD, effectively improving cognitive and memory impairments. DHYZ decreases Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus by reducing BACE1 activity and enhancing Aβ clearance through the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, DHYZ significantly suppresses neuronal apoptosis, enhances synaptic structure, and increases synapse numbers, processes strongly linked to the activation of mitochondrial PINK1-Parkin autophagy.
CONCLUSIONS: DHYZ enhances cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice by stimulating neuronal mitochondrial autophagy through the PINK1-Parkin pathway.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39936280,A brain DNA co-methylation network analysis of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The presence of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is suggested to be associated with distinct molecular and neuropathological profiles in the brain.
METHODS: We assessed brain DNA methylation in AD donors with psychosis (AD+P) and without psychosis (AD-P) using the EPIC array. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified modules of co-methylated genes in a discovery cohort (PITT-ADRC: N = 113 AD+P, N = 40 AD-P), with validation in an independent cohort (BDR: N = 79 AD+P, N = 117 AD-P), with Gene Ontology and cell-type enrichment analysis. Genetic data were integrated to identify methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), which were co-localized with GWAS for related traits.
RESULTS: We replicated one AD+P associated module, which was enriched for synaptic pathways and in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. mQTLs in this module co-localized with variants associated with schizophrenia and educational attainment.
DISCUSSION: This represents the largest epigenetic study of AD+P to date, identifying pleiotropic relationships between AD+P and related traits.
HIGHLIGHTS: DNA methylation was assessed in the prefrontal cortex in subjects with AD+P and AD-P. WGCNA identified six modules of co-methylated loci associated with AD+P in a discovery cohort. One of the modules was replicated in an independent cohort. This module was enriched for synaptic genes and in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. mQTLs mapping to genes in the module co-localized with GWAS loci for schizophrenia and educational attainment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39868480,Malnutrition exacerbating neuropsychiatric symptoms on the Alzheimer's continuum is relevant to the cAMP signaling pathway: Human and mouse studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition correlates with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the potential mechanism underlying this association remains unclear.
METHODS: Baseline and longitudinal associations of nutritional status with NPSs were analyzed in 374 patients on the AD continuum and 61 healthy controls. Serum biomarkers, behavioral tests, cerebral neurotransmitters, and differentially gene expression were evaluated in standard and malnourished diet-fed transgenic APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice.
RESULTS: Poor nutritional status and increased cerebral blood flow in the midbrain and striatum were associated with severe general NPSs and subtypes, especially depression, anxiety, and apathy. APP/PS1 mice fed a malnourished diet showed poor nutritional status, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, altered neurotransmitter levels, and downregulated c-Fos expression in the midbrain and striatum; these were associated with suppressed cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway.
DISCUSSION: Malnutrition exacerbating NPSs is relevant to suppressed cAMP pathway in the midbrain and striatum, suggesting the potential for targeted nutritional interventions to mitigate NPSs in the AD continuum.
HIGHLIGHTS: Poor nutritional status linked to general and specific neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) deterioration. Malnutrition affects NPSs, usually involving the midbrain and striatum. Malnourished diet induces depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Malnutrition exacerbates NPSs associated with cAMP signaling pathway in the midbrain and striatum.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40099247,Modulated theta band frequency with binaural beat stimulation correlates with improved cognitive scores in Alzheimer's patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 50 million individuals worldwide, a number projected to triple by 2050. Due to discomfort through electrical and magnetic neuromodulation technologies, this is the first study to propose the potential of auditory binaural beat (BB) stimulation at an alpha frequency (10 Hz) for enhancing cognitive and neurological outcomes in AD patients.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients were divided into the experimental-Group (n = 15) and control-Group (n = 10). Psychometric and neurological assessments were conducted Pre-Treatment (Day 1) and Post-Treatment (Day 14) following consecutive days of binaural beats (BB) or auditory tone stimulation administered from Day 2 to Day 13.
RESULTS: A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of group (F = 6.087, p = 0.016) and session (F = 3.859, p = 0.024) on MMSE scores, with the experimental group showing significant improvement in MMSE scores (t = 7.33, p = 0.00000012) compared to the control group (p = 0.2306). Paired t-tests revealed a significant reduction in depression scores (DASS-21, t = 1.701, p = 0.0253) in the experimental group, while no significant improvements were noted in the control group. EEG recordings revealed significant changes in α-band, β-band, and γ-band power (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, The correlation between EEG bands and MMSE subparts showed that increased θ-band power in the experimental group was positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with the frontal region during language tasks and in the frontal and central regions during registration and orientation tasks, indicating potential neurocognitive benefits.
DISCUSSION: The results of this research imply that BB stimulation has untapped potential as a non-invasive therapy for patients with AD, hence there is the need for further studies to manage the dementia epidemic.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40110679,Metabolic stress and age drive inflammation and cognitive decline in mice and humans.,"INTRODUCTION: Metabolic stressors (obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes [T2D]) increase the risk of cognitive impairment (CI), including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immune system dysregulation and inflammation, particularly microglial mediated, may underlie this risk, but mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: Using a high-fat diet-fed (HFD) model, we assessed longitudinal metabolism and cognition, and terminal inflammation and brain spatial transcriptomics. Additionally, we performed hippocampal spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing of post mortem tissue from AD and T2D human subjects versus controls.
RESULTS: HFD induced progressive metabolic and CI with terminal inflammatory changes, and dysmetabolic, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory gene expression profiles, particularly in microglia. AD and T2D human subjects had similar gene expression changes, including in secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), a pro-inflammatory gene associated with AD.
DISCUSSION: These data show that metabolic stressors cause early and progressive CI, with inflammatory changes that promote disease. They also indicate a role for microglia, particularly microglial SPP1, in CI.
HIGHLIGHTS: Metabolic stress causes persistent metabolic and cognitive impairments in mice. Murine and human brain spatial transcriptomics align and indicate a pro-inflammatory milieu. Transcriptomic data indicate a role for microglial-mediated inflammatory mechanisms. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 emerged as a potential target of interest in metabolically driven cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39876020,"Cell-specific transcriptional signatures of vascular cells in Alzheimer's disease: perspectives, pathways, and therapeutic directions.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that is marked by profound neurovascular dysfunction and significant cell-specific alterations in the brain vasculature. Recent advances in high throughput single-cell transcriptomics technology have enabled the study of the human brain vasculature at an unprecedented depth. Additionally, the understudied niche of cerebrovascular cells, such as endothelial and mural cells, and their subtypes have been scrutinized for understanding cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity in AD. Here, we provide an overview of rich transcriptional signatures derived from recent single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic studies of human brain vascular cells and their implications for targeted therapy for AD. We conducted an in-depth literature search using Medline and Covidence to identify pertinent AD studies that utilized single-cell technologies in human post-mortem brain tissue by focusing on understanding the transcriptional differences in cerebrovascular cell types and subtypes in AD and cognitively normal older adults. We also discuss impaired cellular crosstalk between vascular cells and neuroglial units, as well as astrocytes in AD. Additionally, we contextualize the findings from single-cell studies of distinct endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes in the human AD brain and highlight pathways for potential therapeutic interventions as a concerted multi-omic effort with spatial transcriptomics technology, neuroimaging, and neuropathology. Overall, we provide a detailed account of the vascular cell-specific transcriptional signatures in AD and their crucial cellular crosstalk with the neuroglial unit.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40111920,Differences between East and West may affect dementia studies: Thoughts from the KSA dementia prevalence study.,"While science is the same in the East and West, certain personal characteristics may distort scientific results. This is more likely in the East. An example may be a recent project in the East that measured the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia in a very large group. They found it to be near 1%, which seems very low. Studies that show a low prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia could be due to an examination of a very healthy group with very few older people, and/or poor/inaccurate testing (none of which were in this study). Another possibility is that the person, their family or their doctor aim at ignoring or hiding a diagnosis of dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39956974,"Prevalence and correlates of the head turning sign in mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to neurodegenerative, chronic cerebrovascular, and mixed etiologies.","BackgroundThe head turning sign (HTS) consists in the patient turning his/her head towards the accompanying person in search for support when being asked questions. Although the HTS is known to be associated with cognitive impairment, previous investigations were biased towards Alzheimer's disease (AD) or did not differentiate between diverse dementia etiologies; moreover, little is known about the specific cognitive correlates of the HTS.ObjectiveTo assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of the HTS in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of various etiologies.MethodsThe HTS was recorded during the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in 232 MCI/dementia patients with the following etiological classification: AD (N = 121); frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD; N = 24); Lewy body disease (LBD; N = 11); vascular (N = 29); mixed (N = 47).ResultsThe overall prevalence of the HTS in the whole cohort was 27.6%. Albeit being descriptively higher in dementia (29.9%) versus MCI (22.7%), as well as descriptively lower in FTLD and LBD than in remaining subgroups, no significant association was detected between the HTS and either MCI/dementia status or etiology. HTS + patients were older and more frequently females, also reporting lower MMSE scores and differing from HTS- ones on Temporal and Spatial Orientation and Constructional Praxis sub-scores. An association between the HTS and lower MMSE scores was found in patients with MCI but not in those with dementia.ConclusionsIn patients with cognitive impairment due to diverse causes, the HTS might occur regardless of MCI versus dementia status and across different etiologies. MCI patients displaying the HTS might have more severe cognitive deficits.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39747219,Correlation of physicochemical properties with antioxidant activity in phenol and thiophenol analogues.,"Oxidative stress, associated with excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), contributes to the development and progression of many ailments, such as aging, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cancer, preeclampsia or multiple sclerosis. While phenols and polyphenols are the most studied antioxidants structurally similar compounds such as anilines or thiophenols are sporadically analyzed despite their radical scavenging potential. This work assesses the impact of structural features of phenols and thiophenols on their antioxidant activity. Seventeen pairs of phenol/thiophenol analogues, possessing both electron-donating and withdrawing groups were selected for this study. Several physicochemical properties of the compounds were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the (U)B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory for gas phase calculations and at the (U)B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) scrf = (smd, solvent = water) level for the solvated ones. Correlations between calculated properties and experimental radical scavenging activities were investigated to identify the pivotal physical characteristics contributing to antioxidant efficiency. These include S-H and O-H bond distances and bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE), dipole moments, logP values, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbital energies, and the HOMO-LUMO gap energies that were calculated at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, and Fukui functions. The experimental activity was evaluated using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays. Several compounds exhibited superior scavenging abilities, surpassing that of the reference antioxidant Trolox. The extensive DFT calculations revealed that in the gas phase, lower BDE values, compared to IP and PA, suggested that the HAT mechanism predominates in case of these compound groups. In contrast, in water, significant reductions in PA due to solvent effects suggested that the SPLET mechanism is dominant under aqueous conditions.",Sci Rep,2025
39926613,"CSF biomarkers are differentially linked to brain areas high and low in noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.","Neurotransmitter systems of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine are implicated in cognitive functions such as memory, learning and attention and are known to be altered in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Specific brain structures involved in these systems, e.g. the locus coeruleus, the main source of noradrenaline in the cortex, are in fact affected earliest by Alzheimer's disease tau pathology. Preserved volumetric neurotransmitter specific brain areas could therefore be an important neural resource for cognitive reserve in aging. The aim of this study was to determine whether volumes of brain areas known to be high in neurotransmitter receptors are relatively preserved in individuals with lower levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Based on the Human Protein Atlas for neurotransmitter receptor distribution, we distinguished between 'areas high and low' in noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine and assessed associations of atrophy in those areas with CSF amyloid-ß 42/40, CSF phosphorylated tau protein and cognitive function across healthy controls (n = 122), individuals with subjective cognitive decline (n = 156), mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 126) using structural equation modelling. CSF pathology markers were inversely correlated and showed a stronger association with disease severity, suggesting distinguishable interrelatedness of these biomarkers depending on the stage of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Across groups, amyloid pathology was linked to atrophy in areas high as well as low in neurotransmitter receptor densities, while tau pathology did not show any significant link to brain area volumes for any of the neurotransmitters. Within disease severity groups, individuals with more amyloid pathology showed more atrophy only in 'areas high in noradrenaline', whereas for dopamine tau pathology was linked to higher volumes in areas low in receptor density possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. Furthermore, individuals with more tau pathology showed a selective decrease in memory function while amyloid pathology was related to a decline in executive function and language capacity as well as memory function. In summary, our analyses highlight the benefits of investigating disease-relevant factors in Alzheimer's disease using a multivariate multigroup approach. Assessing multivariate dependencies in different disease stages and across individuals revealed selective links of pathologies, cognitive decline and atrophy in particular for areas modulated by noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin.",Brain Commun,2025
40088623,Relation of Alzheimer's disease-related TDP-43 proteinopathy to metrics from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI).,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) deposition is linked to regional brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but diffusion changes associated with AD-related TDP-43 proteinopathy remain underexplored. This study evaluates the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) as in vivo markers for detecting TDP-43 proteinopathy in AD. We analyzed DTI and NODDI metrics in 49 cases with AD neuropathologic changes, categorized by postmortem TDP-43 status. Diffusion metrics from the temporal lobe gray and white matter regions and key white matter tracts were compared between TDP-43-positive and negative cases. Group differences were significant in the left hippocampus, amygdala, and uncinate fasciculus after adjusting for age, Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage and APOE ε4 status. TDP-43-positive cases showed increased mean diffusivity (MD) and altered neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis revealed high predictive accuracy for amygdala ODI (AUC = 0.809, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.76), hippocampal MD (AUC = 0.763, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.67), and uncinate fasciculus MD (AUC = 0.782, sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.61). Combined, DTI/NODDI predictors demonstrated stronger discriminative ability (AUC = 0.856, sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.76). These findings suggest that AD-related TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with specific diffusion changes in the left temporal lobe. DTI and NODDI metrics, particularly MD, NDI, and ODI, may improve the antemortem detection of TDP-43 pathology in AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
40131695,Treadmill Exercise Modulates the Leptin/LepR/GSK-3β Signalling Pathway to Improve Leptin Sensitivity and Alleviate Neuroinflammation in High-Fat Diet-Fed APP/PS1 Mice.,"Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is closely associated with obesity. In AD, the fat cell-secreted protein leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier and protects against nerve damage. However, obesity may induce leptin resistance, reduce leptin sensitivity, stimulate excessive glial cell activation, promote inflammatory factor production and exacerbate brain inflammation. Unfortunately, the mechanism of interaction among high-fat diets, obesity, neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. We investigated the changes in neuroinflammation and leptin sensitivity in the brains of wild-type and high-fat-diet-fed APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We explored the effects of treadmill exercise for 12 weeks on the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway and memory. The body weights of the high-fat-diet-fed mice increased, and elevated levels of markers for leptin resistance, including suppressor of signalling 3 (SOCS3), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and proinflammatory factors such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were observed. After 12 weeks of aerobic exercise, the leptin mRNA and protein levels increased, GSK-3β protein expression decreased and the mean fluorescence intensities of brain microglial (IBA-1) and neuron markers (NeuN) decreased, indicating that exercise may activate the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β signalling pathway, reducing glial cell activation and inflammation. Our study revealed that obesity induces and exacerbates the AD-related neuroinflammatory response. Aerobic exercise activates the leptin/LepR/GSK-3β pathway to relieve neuroinflammation and protect nerve cells, alleviating AD-associated memory loss. These promising outcomes could inform the development of nondrug-based aerobic exercise interventions for the treatment of AD and associated cognitive disorders.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40092369,Unraveling the role of proteins in dementia: insights from two UK cohorts with causal evidence.,"Population-based proteomics offers a groundbreaking avenue to predict future disease risks, enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, and discover novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The role of plasma proteins in dementia, however, requires further exploration. This study investigated 276 protein-dementia associations in 229 incident all-cause dementia, 89 Alzheimer's disease, and 41 vascular dementia among 3249 participants (55% women, 97.2% white ethnicity) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) over a median 9.8-year follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazard regression for the analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to assess the precision of the identified proteins from the fully adjusted Cox regression models in predicting incident all-cause dementia, both individually and in combination with demographic predictors, APOE genotype, and memory score, to estimate the area under the curve. Additionally, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm was used to identify the most important features predictive of future all-cause dementia onset. These associations were then validated in 1506 incident all-cause dementia, 732 Alzheimer's disease, 281 vascular dementia, and 111 frontotemporal dementia cases among 52 745 individuals (53.9% women, 93.3% White ethnicity) from the UK Biobank over a median 13.7-year follow-up. Two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization and drug target Mendelian randomization were further employed to determine the causal direction between protein concentration and dementia. NEFL (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]: 1.54 [1.29, 1.84]) and RPS6KB1 (HR [95% CI]: 1.33 [1.16, 1.52]) were robustly associated with incident all-cause dementia; MMP12 (HR [95% CI]: 2.06 [1.41, 2.99]) was associated with vascular dementia in ELSA, after correcting for multiple testing. Additional markers EDA2R and KIM1 were identified from subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Combining NEFL and RPS6KB1 with other predictors yielded high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.871) for incident all-cause dementia. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm also identified RPS6KB1, NEFL, and KIM1 as the most important protein features for predicting future all-cause dementia. Sex difference was evident for the association between RPS6KB1 and all-cause dementia, with stronger association in men (P for interaction = 0.037). Replication in the UK Biobank confirmed the associations between the identified proteins and various dementia subtypes. The results from Mendelian randomization in the reverse direction indicated that several proteins serve as early markers for dementia, rather than being direct causes of the disease. These findings provide insights into putative mechanisms for dementia. Future studies are needed to validate the findings on RPS6KB1 in relation to dementia risk.",Brain Commun,2025
39814935,Genetic proxies for clinical traits are associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19.,"Routine use of genetic data in healthcare is much-discussed, yet little is known about its performance in epidemiological models including traditional risk factors. Using severe COVID-19 as an exemplar, we explore the integration of polygenic risk scores (PRS) into disease models alongside sociodemographic and clinical variables. PRS were optimized for 23 clinical variables and related traits previously-associated with severe COVID-19 in up to 450,449 UK Biobank participants, and tested in 9,560 individuals diagnosed in the pre-vaccination era. Associations were further adjusted for (i) sociodemographic and (ii) clinical variables. Pathway analyses of PRS were performed to improve biological understanding of disease. In univariate analyses, 17 PRS were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 and, of these, four remained associated with COVID-19 outcomes following adjustment for sociodemographic/clinical variables: hypertension PRS (OR = 1.1, 95%CI 1.03-1.18), atrial fibrillation PRS (OR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.03-1.22), peripheral vascular disease PRS (OR = 0.9, 95%CI 0.82-0.99), and Alzheimer's disease PRS (OR = 1.14, 95%CI 1.05-1.25). Pathway analyses revealed enrichment of genetic variants in pathways for cardiac muscle contraction (genes N = 5; beta[SE] = 3.48[0.60]; adjusted-P = 1.86 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). These findings underscore the potential for integrating genetic data into epidemiological models and highlight the advantages of utilizing multiple trait PRS rather than a single PRS for a specific outcome of interest.",Sci Rep,2025
39874947,Analysis of TEM micrographs with deep learning reveals APOE genotype-specific associations between HDL particle diameter and Alzheimer's dementia.,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle diameter distribution is informative in the diagnosis of many conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, obtaining an accurate HDL size measurement is challenging. We demonstrated the utility of measuring the diameter of more than 1,800,000 HDL particles with the deep learning model YOLOv7 (you only look once) from micrographs of 183 HDL samples, including patients with dementia or normal cognition (controls). This method was shown to be more efficient and accurate than conventional image analysis software. Using this method, we found a higher abundance of small HDLs in participants with dementia compared to controls in patients with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε3ε4 genotype, whereas patients with the APOE ε3ε3 genotype had higher variability in the abundance of different HDL subclasses. Our results show an example of accurate individual HDL particle diameter measurement for large-scale clinical samples, which can be expanded to characterize the relationship between disease risk and other nanoparticles in the sub-20-nm diameter size range.",Cell Rep Methods,2025

40050444,Neuroinflammatory fluid biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic literature review.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is associated with both early and late stages of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fluid biomarkers are gaining significance in clinical practice for diagnosis in presymptomatic stages, monitoring, and disease prognosis. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to identify fluid biomarkers for neuroinflammation related to clinical stages across the AD continuum and examined long-term outcomes associated with changes in biomarkers.
METHODS: The SLR was conducted per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We used PubMed®, Embase®, and Cochrane Collaboration databases to search for articles in English (between 2012 and 2022) on AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD, using ""neuroinflammation"" or other ""immune"" search strings. Two independent reviewers screened titles and examined data from full-text articles for the SLR.
RESULTS: After the initial screening, 54 studies were prioritized for data extraction based upon their relevance to the SLR research questions. Nine studies for YKL-40, seven studies for sTREM2, and 11 studies for GFAP examined the relationship between the neuroinflammatory biomarkers and the clinical stage of the disease. Nine longitudinal studies further explored the association of fluid biomarkers with long-term clinical outcomes of disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of YKL-40 were elevated in patients with AD dementia, while CSF sTREM2 levels were more strongly associated with preclinical and early symptomatic stages of AD. Plasma GFAP levels remained consistently elevated both in patients with AD dementia and individuals in preclinical stages with β-amyloid pathology. Longitudinal changes in plasma GFAP appeared to be predictive of cognitive decline in patients over time.
DISCUSSION: Neuroinflammatory biomarkers are associated with AD progression. More longitudinal studies in the preclinical and MCI stages of AD are needed to validate fluid biomarkers for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and prognosis in clinical practice.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40194012,Improving Wait-times in Outpatient Neurology for Patients Referred from the Emergency Department─A Pilot Study (P2-1.011).,"OBJECTIVE: To improve access to outpatient neurology by reducing wait-times for patients requiring urgent neurological evaluation.
BACKGROUND: There is currently a shortage of neurologists providing outpatient care, contributing to long wait-times. Stanford Neurology has an average wait-time of 86 days between the date of referral from the emergency department (ED) and the date of their outpatient appointment. Delays in care can negatively affect patient outcomes and cause undue psychological stress on patients waiting for their neurological evaluation.
DESIGN/METHODS: A novel clinic model was established to address the long wait-times by prioritizing new patient intake to maintain capacity to continuously accept new referrals. Return slots were strictly limited to one-time follow-up of investigations ordered at the first appointment or for reassessment after initiation of first-line management. Most patients follow up with their primary care provider based on neurology's recommendations, and patients who require further neurological expertise are transferred to the relevant subspecialty clinic for long-term management. Average wait-times were collected in the 6 months before and after this clinic was launched. The goal was to see patients within 14 days based on national benchmarks on ED referrals.
RESULTS: In the 6 months after the clinic was established, the average wait-time was reduced from 86 days to 23, representing a 73% reduction (p<0.001). The 14-day target was not met due to several factors including patient preference for a later appointment date, being unable to reach the patient in a timely manner to schedule the appointment and limitations in provider schedule availability.
CONCLUSIONS: The pilot project was successful in dramatically reducing wait-times for ED referrals to outpatient neurology by 73%. These results suggest that this novel clinic model can likely be replicated at other healthcare institutions and could have a significant impact on neurology wait-times beyond Stanford Neurology.

40015276,BACE1-dependent cleavage of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor contributes to neural hyperexcitability and disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neural hyperexcitability has been clinically associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that decreased GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) currents are linked to hippocampal granule cell hyperexcitability in the AD mouse model APP23. Elevated levels of β-secretase (BACE1), the β-secretase responsible for generating Aβ peptides, lead to aberrant cleavage of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β1/2/3 subunits in the brains of APP23 mice and AD patients. Moreover, BACE1-dependent cleavage of the β subunits leads to a decrease in GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibitory currents in BACE1 transgenic mice. Finally, we show that the neural hyperexcitability, Aβ load, and spatial memory deficit phenotypes of APP23 mice are significantly reduced upon the granule cell expression of a non-cleavable β3 subunit mutant. Collectively, our study establishes that BACE1-dependent cleavage of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β subunits promotes the pathological hyperexcitability known to drive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in the AD brain, suggesting that prevention of the cleavage could slow disease progression.",Neuron,2025
39691162,"Bibliometric analysis of rehabilitation in Alzheimer's disease (2000-2023): trends, hotspots and prospects.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that leads to insidious deterioration of brain functions and is considered the sixth leading cause of death in the world. Multiple studies have shown that rehabilitation therapy is becoming an important field of AD research in recent years.
OBJECTIVE: We opted for bibliometric analysis to comprehensively summarize the advancements in the study of AD rehabilitation treatment, aiming to provide researchers with current trends and future research directions.
METHODS: All articles and reviews pertaining to rehabilitation treatment in Alzheimer's disease from 2000 to 2023 were downloaded through Web of Science Core Collection. The results were subjected to bibliometric analysis using Microsoft Excel (2019 version), CiteSpace (6.3 R1 Advanced) and VOSviewer 1.6.20.
RESULTS: Overall, 1,284 publications were included. The number of publications was increasing yearly. The United States has published the most publications. University of Toronto has published the most papers of all institutions. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION and ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION were the journals with the most studies and the most commonly cited, respectively. Clare L is the author with the highest productivity and co-citation. After analysis, the most common keywords are mild cognitive impairment, cognitive, impairment memory and executive function indicates that cognitive impairment is the main focus of research. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, cognitive rehabilitation, and physical activity/exercise are the hotspots of research at the present stage and are likely to continue.
CONCLUSION: Distinguishing non pharmacological treatments at different stages of development is a research hotspot in AD rehabilitation; Sports intervention, brain functional imaging techniques represented by brain functional connectivity, virtual reality, and quality of life are research directions that need attention.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39988604,Neuroprotective mitochondria targeted small molecule restores synapses and the distribution of synaptic mitochondria in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.,"Loss of synaptic activity correlates best with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that mild inhibition of mitochondrial complex I with the small molecule tricyclic pyrone compound CP2 restores long-term potentiation and cognitive function assessed by electrophysiology and behavior tests in multiple mouse models of AD. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction, we examined the effect of CP2 treatment on synapses, and the distribution and morphology of synaptic mitochondria in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Structural data confirmed the loss of synapses in APP/PS1 compared to non-transgenic (NTG) littermates. Mitochondrial distribution assessed in pre- and postsynaptic compartments was significantly altered in AD model demonstrating increased presence of mitochondria around dendritic spines compared to NTG mice, indicating the loss of mitochondrial ability to support synaptic function. CP2 treatment restored distribution of synaptic mitochondria and the number of synapses to the NTG control levels. Improved synaptic function in CP2-treated APP/PS1 mice was supported by RNA-seq analysis indicating upregulation of genes involved in axonal guidance, dendritic maturation and synaptic function, and Western blot analysis of brain tissue. Taken together, functional, imaging, biochemistry and structural findings further support the potential of targeting mitochondria as a therapeutic approach for AD.",Sci Rep,2025
40013094,Functional and effective EEG connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be best conceptualized as a disconnection syndrome, such that symptoms may be largely attributable to disrupted communication between brain regions, rather than to deterioration within discrete systems. EEG is uniquely capable of directly and non-invasively measuring neural activity with precise temporal resolution; connectivity quantifies the relationships between such signals in different brain regions. EEG research on connectivity in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often considered a prodromal phase of AD, has produced mixed results and has yet to be synthesized for comprehensive review. Thus, we performed a systematic review of EEG connectivity in MCI and AD participants compared with cognitively healthy older adult controls.
METHODS: We searched PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies in English on EEG, connectivity, and MCI/AD relative to controls. Of 1,344 initial matches, 124 articles were ultimately included in the systematic review.
RESULTS: The included studies primarily analyzed coherence, phase-locked, and graph theory metrics. The influence of factors such as demographics, design, and approach was integrated and discussed. An overarching pattern emerged of lower connectivity in both MCI and AD compared to healthy controls, which was most prominent in the alpha band, and most consistent in AD. In the minority of studies reporting greater connectivity, theta band was most commonly implicated in both AD and MCI, followed by alpha. The overall prevalence of alpha effects may indicate its potential to provide insight into nuanced changes associated with AD-related networks, with the caveat that most studies were during the resting state where alpha is the dominant frequency. When greater connectivity was reported in MCI, it was primarily during task engagement, suggesting compensatory resources may be employed. In AD, greater connectivity was most common during rest, suggesting compensatory resources during task engagement may already be exhausted.
CONCLUSION: The review highlighted EEG connectivity as a powerful tool to advance understanding of AD-related changes in brain communication. We address the need for including demographic and methodological details, using source space connectivity, and extending this work to cognitively healthy older adults with AD risk toward advancing early AD detection and intervention.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39880902,The genetics of neurodegenerative diseases is the genetics of age-related damage clearance failure.,"In this perspective we draw together the data from the genome wide association studies for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and the tauopathies and reach the conclusion that in each case, most of the risk loci are involved in the clearance of the deposited proteins: in Alzheimer's disease, the microglial removal of Aβ, in the synucleinopathies, the lysosomal clearance of synuclein and in the tauopathies, the removal of tau protein by the ubiquitin proteasome. We make the point that most loci identified through genome wide association studies are not strictly pathogenic but rather relate to failures to remove age related damage. We discuss these issues in the context of copathologies in elderly individuals and the prediction of disease through polygenic risk score analysis at different ages. Finally, we discuss what analytic approaches are needed now that we have adequately sized case control analyses in white populations.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
39839307,"Therapeutic potential of hydrogen-rich water in zebrafish model of Alzheimer's disease: targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and the gut-brain axis.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, with amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation playing a key role in its pathogenesis. Aβ-induced oxidative stress leads to neuronal damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, making antioxidative strategies promising for AD treatment. This study investigates the effects of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in a zebrafish AD model. Zebrafish were exposed to aluminum chloride to induce AD-like pathology and then treated with HRW using a nanobubble device. Behavioral assays, ELISA, Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil fluorescence labeling were employed to assess HRW's impact. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing analyzed HRW's effect on gut microbiota. HRW can significantly improve cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior in zebrafish AD model, reduce Aβ deposition (p &lt; 0.0001), regulate liver Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) levels (p &lt; 0.05), reduce neuroinflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. Furthermore, HRW reduced the number of harmful bacteria linked to AD pathology by restoring the balance of microbiota in the gut. These findings suggest that HRW has potential as a therapeutic strategy for AD by targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut-brain axis modulation.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40038788,Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with substantial genetic influence. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci for late-onset AD (LOAD), the functional mechanisms underlying most of these associations remain unresolved. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), represent a promising avenue for elucidating such mechanisms within some of these loci.
METHODS: By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing 20,205 common SVs from 1088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits were examined.
RESULTS: First, we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with the phenotypes tested. The strongest association was a deletion of an Alu element in the 3'UTR of the TMEM106B gene, in high LD with the respective AD GWAS locus and associated with multiple AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD) phenotypes, including tangles density, TDP-43, and cognitive resilience. The deletion of this element was also linked to lower TMEM106B protein abundance. We also found a 22-kb deletion associated with depression in ROS/MAP and bearing similar association patterns as GWAS SNPs at the IQCK locus. In addition, we leveraged our catalog of SV-GWAS to replicate and characterize independent findings in SV-based GWAS for AD and five other neurodegenerative diseases. Among these findings, we highlight the replication of genome-wide significant SVs for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), including markers for the 17q21.31 MAPT locus inversion and a 1483-bp deletion at the CYP2A13 locus, along with other suggestive associations, such as a 994-bp duplication in the LMNTD1 locus, suggestively linked to AD and a 3958-bp deletion at the DOCK5 locus linked to Lewy body disease (LBD) (P = 3.36 × 10<sup>-4</sup>).
CONCLUSIONS: While still limited in sample size, this study highlights the utility of including analysis of SVs for elucidating mechanisms underlying GWAS loci and provides a valuable resource for the characterization of the effects of SVs in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.",Genome Med,2025
39811700,Utilizing deep learning to predict Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment with optical coherence tomography.,"INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic performance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains limited. We aimed to develop a deep-learning algorithm using OCT to detect AD and MCI.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving 228 Asian participants (173 cases/55 controls) for model development and testing on 68 Asian (52 cases/16 controls) and 85 White (39 cases/46 controls) participants. Features from OCT were used to develop an ensemble trilateral deep-learning model.
RESULTS: The trilateral model significantly outperformed single non-deep learning models in Asian (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.91 vs. 0.71-0.72, p = 0.022-0.032) and White (AUC = 0.84 vs. 0.58-0.75, p = 0.056- &lt; 0.001) populations. However, its performance was comparable to that of the trilateral statistical model (AUCs similar, p &gt; 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Both multimodal approaches, using deep learning or traditional statistical models, show promise for AD and MCI detection. The choice between these models may depend on computational resources, interpretability preferences, and clinical needs.
HIGHLIGHTS: A deep-learning algorithm was developed to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using OCT images.The combined model outperformed single OCT parameters in both Asian and White cohorts.The study demonstrates the potential of OCT-based deep-learning algorithms for AD and MCI detection.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39784680,The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on global cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease: An update meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. At present, there are currently no drugs that can cure AD.
OBJECTIVE: A number of empirical studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be used to treat cognitive abnormalities in patients with AD. We will through meta-analysis reviews tDCS overall research on the effects of cognitive function in patients with AD.
METHODS: Systematic searches were performed in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from their creation until 8 March 2024. Using a fixed effect model and random effect model to evaluate the average difference between the treatment group and control group (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The study included 10 randomized controlled trials (Nactive = 165, Nsham = 167). The results of the overall analysis showed that tDCS did not significantly improve the overall cognitive function (SMD = 0.17; 95%CI = -0.05, 0.39; p = 0.14; I² = 51%). Quality of life of AD patients after treatment was also evaluated, but no improvement was seen. Subgroup analysis showed no significant improvement in global cognitive function after tDCS treatment. The sensitivity analysis to confirm the reliability of the data, risk assessment did not find any high-risk projects.
CONCLUSIONS: The tDCS treatment did not improve cognitive function in patients with AD. Further empirical research in the future will help to explore new schemes for tDCS to improve cognitive function of patients.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39719507,In vivo hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with synaptic loss and behavioral abnormalities in the absence of tau seeds.,"Tau pathology is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the sequence of events and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPT<sup>Int10+3G&gt;A</sup> and MAPT<sup>S305N;Int10+3G&gt;A</sup> lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance.",Nat Neurosci,2025
40034855,M3NetFlow: A multi-scale multi-hop graph AI model for integrative multi-omic data analysis.,"Multi-omic data-driven studies are at the forefront of precision medicine by characterizing complex disease signaling systems across multiple views and levels. The integration and interpretation of multi-omic data are critical for identifying disease targets and deciphering disease signaling pathways. However, it remains an open problem due to the complex signaling interactions among many proteins. Herein, we propose a multi-scale multi-hop multi-omic network flow model, M3NetFlow, to facilitate both hypothesis-guided and generic multi-omic data analysis tasks. We evaluated M3NetFlow using two independent case studies: (1) uncovering mechanisms of synergy of drug combinations (hypothesis/anchor-target guided multi-omic analysis) and (2) identifying biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (generic multi-omic analysis). The evaluation and comparison results showed that M3NetFlow achieved the best prediction accuracy and identified a set of drug combination synergy- and disease-associated targets. The model can be directly applied to other multi-omic data-driven studies.",iScience,2025
39801129,Unveiling the safety profile of lecanemab: A comprehensive analysis of adverse events using FDA adverse event reporting system data.,"BACKGROUND: Lecanemab, a novel monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β, has shown promise in treating Alzheimer's disease. Comprehensive post-marketing safety data analysis is crucial to understand its real-world risk profile.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety profile of lecanemab using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), with a focus on nervous system disorders and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.
METHODS: We conducted a disproportionality analysis using the FAERS database to evaluate the safety signals associated with lecanemab. Reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio, empirical Bayesian geometric mean, and information component were calculated at both system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) levels. Additionally, we performed a time-to-onset analysis using Weibull shape parameter estimation.
RESULTS: Analysis at the SOC level revealed significant signals for nervous system disorders (ROR: 7.32, 95% CI: 6.69-8.00). At the PT level, strong signals were observed for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, particularly those associated with microhemorrhages and oedema (ROR: 4122.81 and 3922.78, respectively). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (200 cases), followed by chills (107 cases) and fatigue (97 cases). Time-to-onset analysis showed a median time of 33 days (range: 1-1283) for all adverse events, with neurological events occurring slightly later (median: 42 days, range: 1-1260).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight a distinct safety profile for lecanemab, with a predominant impact on the nervous system and a notable association with imaging abnormalities. These results underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring and further research to optimize the risk-benefit profile of lecanemab in clinical practice.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39901730,"Neuropathological comorbidity, genetics and cognition in a Chinese community-based autopsy cohort.","Neurodegenerative comorbidities are common and critical, yet data specific to the Chinese population remains limited. The study aims to investigate the prevalence and associations of neuropathologic changes and comorbidities, and their correlation with genetics and cognition in a community-dwelling autopsy cohort in China. Datasets of 610 participants were obtained from the National Human Brain Bank for Development and Function at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College. Neuropathological changes analysed included Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC) (n = 331); α-synucleinopathies (n = 124) with 120 Lewy body disease (LBD) and 4 multiple system atrophy; limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) (n = 341); primary age-related tauopathy (PART) (n = 231); argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) (n = 107); age-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) (n = 144); cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (n = 183); hippocampus sclerosis (HS) (n = 46). Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and amygdala-predominant LBD are rare. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to assess the neuropathological associations. Increased age at death was correlated with increased severity in ADNC, LBD, and LATE-NC, as well as with a higher number of comorbidities. APOE ε4 allele frequency in the present autopsy cohort was 13.63%. The presence of the APOE ε4 allele was linked to an advanced ADNC stage and increased comorbidities. The co-pathology prevalence varied by pathologies, with notable increases in specific subgroups: within the ADNC subgroups, LBD, LATE-NC, CAA, and HS were more frequent in advanced stages; in the LATE-NC subgroups, ADNC, CAA, and ARTAG increased, while PART decreased in higher LATE-NC stages. PART cases presented the highest proportion of pure pathology (37.2%) compared to other groups. Advanced ADNC stages were significantly associated with higher LATE-NC stages, and vice versa. Neocortical LBD was correlated with elevated ADNC levels, and higher LATE-NC stages were associated with worsening LBD pathology. High level ADNC, neocortical LBD, and stage 3 of LATE-NC were identified as independent predictors of severe cognition status. Our study suggests that older age at death and APOE ε4 presence are the risk factors for neuropathologic comorbidities in Chinese people. The findings underscore the importance of considering comorbid neurologic diagnoses and therapies in clinical practice.",Brain,2025
39883631,Potential Azo-8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives as multi-target lead candidates for Alzheimer's disease: An in-depth in silico study of monoamine oxidase and cholinesterase inhibitors.,"Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease results from a complex interplay of various pathological processes, including the dysregulation of key enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). This study proposes and designs a series of novel molecules derived from 8-hydroxyquinoline (Azo-8HQ) as potential multi-target lead candidates for treating AD. An exhaustive in silico analysis was conducted, encompassing docking studies, ADMET analysis, density functional theory (DFT) studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and subsequent MM-GBSA calculations to examine the pharmacological potential of these molecules with the specific targets of interest. Out of the 63 Azo-8HQ derivatives analysed, two molecules, 14c and 17c, demonstrated strong affinities for AChE, BuChE, and MAO-B, along with favourable pharmacokinetic profiles and electronic properties. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of these molecules within the active sites of the targets, and MM-GBSA calculations revealed low binding energies, indicating robust interactions. These findings identify molecules 14c and 17c as promising multi-target candidates for the treatment of AD, based on an in-depth computational study aimed at minimizing drug development costs and time. Future work will include the synthesis of these molecules followed by in-depth in vitro and in vivo testing to validate their potential therapeutic efficacy.",PLoS One,2025
40092434,Quantification and stimulation of human glymphatic dynamics: New features of Alzheimer's disease and effects of brain photobiomodulation.,"A non-invasive device to measure the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly desirable because CSF facilitates the cleaning of neurotoxic wastes in the brain. A better understanding of CSF dynamics helps promote healthy aging in older adults and to treat patients with neurological diseases. This study employed a multi-color optical method to quantify prefrontal CSF dynamics in two groups: (1) older adults with (n = 16) and without (n = 27) Alzheimer's disease and (2) young adults (n = 26) before and after prefrontal light stimulation. The results revealed that the coupling strengths between cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CSF were age-dependent and significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls. Prefrontal light stimulation significantly enhanced CBV-CSF coupling, suggesting improved CSF drainage. This study underscores the multi-color optical strategy as a unique tool for monitoring the interaction between CBV and CSF, as well as metabolic functions in the human brain, while demonstrating the therapeutic potential of brain light stimulation in treating neurodegenerative diseases involving CSF drainage dysfunction.",Res Sq,2025
40169870,Association of the digital clock drawing test with amyloid and tau PET biomarkers in low age risk adults.,"Although brain amyloid and tau deposition measured by PET scans are established as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they can emerge decades before symptoms are detectable on traditional neuropsychological (NP) tests. There is a pressing need for early AD detection tools that are more accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive. The digital clock drawing test (dCDT), a digital version of the clock drawing test, has emerged as a promising cognitive assessment tool that takes minutes to administer and can reveal clinical symptoms earlier than paper-pencil NP tests. This study explored the association between 53 dCDT measures and amyloid and tau PET biomarkers using data from 87 low age risk participants in the Framingham Heart Study. Our findings revealed a significant association between a dCDT measure related to spatial reasoning function and global amyloid burden (P < 0.05), and 4 dCDT measures correlated with tau accumulation after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Notably, the combination of demographic variables and a composite dCDT score achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 in detecting amyloid positivity. These results highlight the potential of dCDT measures as effective predictors of amyloid and tau pathology in preclinical AD.",Sci Rep,2025
39716822,Alzheimer's disease prediction and prevention in a public health perspective: Ethical considerations and collaborations beyond the biomedical paradigm.,"The prevention of dementia is increasingly a task for public health promotion and aims at the general public. This likewise holds for potentially modifiable lifestyle risk factors and biomarkers indicating susceptibility. This commentary argues that from a public health ethical perspective, there is a significant overlap between the implications and requirements of the biomedical domain and lifestyle approaches. What's more, once public awareness of Alzheimer's disease prevention or risk reduction is further established, the public will likely intermix options and advice. Public health ethical recommendations should pro-actively reflect on upcoming questions, concerns, and remedies, combine but not separate both domains and anticipate their conceivable interactions.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39972463,γ-Secretase modulator resistance of an aggressive Alzheimer-causing presenilin mutant can be overcome in the heterozygous patient state by a set of advanced compounds.,"BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) species of 42 or 43 amino acids in length (Aβ42/43) trigger Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and are produced in abnormal amounts by mutants of the γ-secretase subunit presenilin-1 (PS1), which represent the primary cause of familial AD (FAD). Lowering these peptides by γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) is increasingly considered a safe strategy to treat AD since these compounds do not affect the overall cleavage of γ-secretase substrates. GSMs were shown to modulate not only wild-type (WT) γ-secretase but also FAD mutants, expanding their potential use also to the familial form of the disease. Unlike most other FAD mutants, the very aggressive PS1 L166P mutant is largely resistant to GSMs. However, these data were mostly obtained from overexpression models, which mimic more the less relevant homozygous state rather than the heterozygous patient situation.
METHODS: Mouse embryonic fibroblast and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal PS1 L166P knock-in (KI) cell models were treated with various GSMs and Aβ responses were assessed by immunoassays and/or gel-based analysis.
RESULTS: We identified GSMs that lower Aβ42 and/or Aβ43 when PS1 L166P is heterozygous, as it is the case in affected patients, and could reduce the amount of pathogenic Aβ species towards WT levels. RO7019009 was the most potent of these compounds, reducing both pathogenic species and concomitantly increasing the short Aβ37 and Aβ38, of which the latter has been associated with delayed AD progression. Another effective compound, the structurally novel indole-type GSM RO5254601 specifically acts on the Aβ42 product line leading to a selective increase of the beneficial Aβ38. Interestingly, we further found that this class of GSMs can bind not only one, but both presenilin fragments suggesting that it targets γ-secretase at an unusual binding site.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that even highly refractory presenilin FAD mutants are in principle tractable with GSMs extending the possibilities for potential clinical studies in FAD with suitable GSM molecules.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39951414,Hybrid-RViT: Hybridizing ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer for Enhanced Alzheimer's disease detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Early detection is critical for preventing progression and formulating effective treatment plans. This study aims to develop a novel deep learning (DL) model, Hybrid-RViT, to enhance the detection of AD. The proposed Hybrid-RViT model integrates the pre-trained convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) with the Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify brain MRI images across different stages of AD. The ResNet-50 adopted for transfer learning, facilitates inductive bias and feature extraction. Concurrently, ViT processes sequences of image patches to capture long-distance relationships via a self-attention mechanism, thereby functioning as a joint local-global feature extractor. The Hybrid-RViT model achieved a training accuracy of 97% and a testing accuracy of 95%, outperforming previous models. This demonstrates its potential efficacy in accurately identifying and classifying AD stages from brain MRI data. The Hybrid-RViT model, combining ResNet-50 and ViT, shows superior performance in AD detection, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for medical professionals in interpreting and analyzing brain MRI images. This model could significantly improve early diagnosis and intervention strategies for AD.",PLoS One,2025
39972104,Towards realistic simulation of disease progression in the visual cortex with CNNs.,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mammalian visual systems share architectural and information processing similarities. We leverage these parallels to develop an in-silico CNN model simulating diseases affecting the visual system. This model aims to replicate neural complexities in an experimentally controlled environment. Therefore, we examine object recognition and internal representations of a CNN under neurodegeneration and neuroplasticity conditions simulated through synaptic weight decay and retraining. This approach can model neurodegeneration from events like tau accumulation, reflecting cognitive decline in diseases such as posterior cortical atrophy, a condition that can accompany Alzheimer's disease and primarily affects the visual system. After each degeneration iteration, we retrain unaffected synapses to simulate ongoing neuroplasticity. Our results show that with significant synaptic decay and limited retraining, the model's representational similarity decreases compared to a healthy model. Early CNN layers retain high similarity to the healthy model, while later layers are more prone to degradation. The results of this study reveal a progressive decline in object recognition proficiency, mirroring posterior cortical atrophy progression. In-silico modeling of neurodegenerative diseases can enhance our understanding of disease progression and aid in developing targeted rehabilitation and treatments.",Sci Rep,2025
39692624,Advancements in Immunity and Dementia Research: Highlights from the 2023 AAIC Advancements: Immunity Conference.,"The immune system is a key player in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. While brain resident immune cell-mediated neuroinflammation and peripheral immune cell (eg, T cell) infiltration into the brain have been shown to significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, the nature and extent of immune responses in the brain in the context of AD and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear. Furthermore, the roles of the peripheral immune system in driving ADRD pathology remain incompletely elucidated. In March of 2023, the Alzheimer's Association convened the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), Advancements: Immunity, to discuss the roles of the immune system in ADRD. A wide range of topics were discussed, such as animal models that replicate human pathology, immune-related biomarkers and clinical trials, and lessons from other fields describing immune responses in neurodegeneration. This manuscript presents highlights from the conference and outlines avenues for future research on the roles of immunity in neurodegenerative disorders.

40042844,"Physical Activity, Alzheimer Plasma Biomarkers, and Cognition.","IMPORTANCE: Physical activity (PA) is a nonpharmacological intervention for dementia prevention. The association between PA and Alzheimer disease (AD) plasma biomarkers remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations among PA; plasma biomarkers, including β-amyloid 42/40 (Aβ42/40), phosphorylated-tau217 (ptau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL); and cognition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included participants with and without cognitive impairment recruited from multiple memory clinics in South Korea between May 2019 and May 2022. Data were analyzed from June to December 2024.
EXPOSURES: PA was assessed as metabolic equivalent task minutes per week using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and categorized into quartiles from the lowest (Q1) to the highest (Q4).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma Aβ42/40, ptau217, GFAP, and NfL were measured. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).
RESULTS: Among 1144 participants (mean [SD] age 70.9 [8.7] years; 744 [65.0%] female), the highest PA quartile showed significantly lower ptau217 (estimate [SE], -0.14 [0.06]; P = .01) and NfL (estimate [SE], -0.12 [0.05]; P = .01) compared with the lowest quartile. Higher PA quartiles were associated with higher MMSE scores (estimate [SE]: Q2, 0.93 [0.31]; P = .003; Q3, 0.82 [0.32]; P = .009; Q4, 0.94 [0.32]; P = .004) and lower CDR-SB scores (estimate [SE]: Q2, -0.33 [0.16]; P = .04; Q3, -0.37 [0.16]; P = .02; Q4, -0.55 [0.16]; P = .001) after adjusting for age, sex, education years, and β-amyloid uptake. In subgroup analyses according to age and cognitive status, the associations of PA and plasma biomarkers with cognition were more pronounced in the older (age ≥65 years) and cognitively impaired groups compared with the younger and cognitively unimpaired groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that PA may help delay cognitive decline by modulating neurodegeneration and AD-specific tau pathologies. However, the cross-sectional design limits causal inference, and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm and clarify these associations.",JAMA Netw Open,2025
39962560,Investigating the Aβ and tau pathology in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease: insights from hybrid PET/MRI and network mapping.,"BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) offers a distinct framework to study the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to its predictable symptom onset and high penetrance of causative mutations. The study aims to examine the spatial distribution and temporal progression of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies, along with mapping the pathology-functional connectivity network, in asymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers using hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI).
METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer's Disease Network, comprising 14 asymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers and 20 cognitively normal healthy controls (CN). Aβ deposition was evaluated using <sup>11</sup>C-PIB PET, while tau aggregation was assessed via <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240 PET imaging. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was analyzed to investigate relationships between pathological burden and neural network changes. Through qualitative analysis, ADAD carriers with marked <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240 uptake in intracranial regions were categorized into Group 2, while others were designated as Group 1.
RESULTS: Asymptomatic ADAD carriers demonstrated a significantly greater Aβ burden across the cortex and striatum compared to CN, although tau PET binding did not differ significantly between the groups. Group 2 participants exhibited elevated <sup>11</sup>C-PIB uptake in the neocortex and striatum, and increased <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240-PET uptake in the medial temporal and other cortical regions. Compared with Group 1, network mapping of rsFC in Group 2 indicated increased connectivity associated with tau deposition in limbic, posterior cortical, and bilateral temporal regions, overlapping with the default mode network, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms. Additionally, reduced connectivity in the left medial inferior temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus aligned with findings in sporadic AD cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the spatiotemporal progression of Aβ and tau pathologies in preclinical ADAD, supporting the hypothesis that Aβ deposition precedes tau pathology. The rsFC alterations observed associate with tau deposition in asymptomatic carriers indicate early network disruptions. Tau network mapping presents a valuable approach for assessing individualized brain connectivity changes in preclinical AD, mitigating single-subject variability and advancing precision assessment in early-stage AD diagnosis.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39843236,Amyloid-Beta Deposition in Basal Frontotemporal Cortex Is Associated with Selective Disruption of Temporal Mnemonic Discrimination.,"Cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), precedes clinical impairment by two to three decades. However, it is unclear whether Aβ contributes to subtle memory deficits observed during the preclinical stage. The heterogeneous emergence of Aβ deposition may selectively impact certain memory domains, which rely on distinct underlying neural circuits. In this context, we tested whether specific domains of mnemonic discrimination, a neural computation essential for episodic memory, exhibit specific deficits related to early Aβ deposition. We tested 108 cognitively unimpaired human older adults (66% female) who underwent 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) and a control group of 35 young adults, on a suite of mnemonic discrimination tasks taxing object, spatial, and temporal domains. We hypothesized that Aβ pathology would be selectively associated with temporal discrimination performance due to Aβ's propensity to accumulate in the basal frontotemporal cortex, which supports temporal processing. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found a dissociation in which generalized age-related deficits were found for object and spatial mnemonic discrimination, while Aβ-PET levels were selectively associated with deficits in temporal mnemonic discrimination. Furthermore, we found that higher Aβ-PET levels in the medial orbitofrontal and inferior temporal cortex, regions supporting temporal processing, were associated with greater temporal mnemonic discrimination deficits, pointing to the selective vulnerability of circuits related to temporal processing early in AD progression. These results suggest that Aβ accumulation within basal frontotemporal regions may disrupt temporal mnemonic discrimination in preclinical AD, and future work is needed to determine whether assessing temporal mnemonic discrimination can aid in predicting emerging AD progression.",J Neurosci,2025
39893456,Retinal optical coherence tomography intensity spatial correlation features as new biomarkers for confirmed Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The nature and severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies in the retina and brain correspond. However, retinal biomarkers need to be validated in clinical cohorts with confirmed AD biomarkers and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The main objective of this study was to investigate whether retinal metrics measured by OCT aid in the early screening and brain pathology monitoring for confirmed AD.
METHODS: This was a case-control study. All participants underwent retinal OCT imaging, and neurological examinations, including amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography. Participants were subdivided into cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD-derived dementia (ADD). Except retinal thickness, we developed the grey level co-occurrence matrix algorithm to extract retinal OCT intensity spatial correlation features (OCT-ISCF), including angular second matrix (ASM), correlation (COR), and homogeneity (HOM), one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences in retinal parameters among the groups, and to analyze the correlation with brain Aβ plaques and cognitive scores. The repeatability and robustness of OCT-ISCF were evaluated using experimental and simulation methods.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 82 participants, subdivided into 20 CN, 22 MCI, and 40 ADD. Compared with the CN, the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer and myoid and ellipsoid zone were significantly thinner (P < 0.05), and ASM, COR, and HOM in several retinal sublayers changed significantly in the ADD (P < 0.05). Notably, the MCI showed significant differences in ASM and COR in the outer segment of photoreceptor compared with the CN (P < 0.05). The changing pattern of OCT-ISCF with interclass correlation coefficients above 0.8 differed from that caused by speckle noise, and was affected by OCT image quality index. Moreover, the retinal OCT-ISCF were more strongly correlated with brain Aβ plaque burden and MoCA scores than retinal thickness. The accuracy using retinal OCT-ISCF (AUC = 0.935, 0.830) was better than that using retinal thickness (AUC = 0.795, 0.705) in detecting ADD and MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that retinal OCT-ISCF enhance the association and detection efficacy of AD pathology compared to retinal thickness, suggesting retinal OCT-ISCF have the potential to be new biomarkers for AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40098201,Adherence and intensity in multimodal lifestyle-based interventions for cognitive decline prevention: state-of-the-art and future directions.,"Preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global priority. Multimodal interventions targeting several risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously are currently being tested worldwide under the World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network of clinical trials. Adherence to these interventions is crucial for their success, yet there is significant heterogeneity in adherence reporting across studies, hindering the understanding of adherence barriers and facilitators. This article is a narrative review of available evidence from multimodal dementia prevention trials. A literature search was conducted using medical databases (MEDLINE via PubMed and SCOPUS) to select relevant studies: nonpharmacological multimodal interventions (i.e., combining three or more intervention domains), targeting individuals without dementia, and using changes in cognitive performance and/or incident mild cognitive impairment or dementia as primary outcomes. Based on the findings, we propose future adherence reporting to encompass both participation (average attendance to each intervention component) and lifestyle change using dementia risk scores (e.g., the LIBRA index). Moreover, we provide an estimation of the expected intensity of multimodal interventions, defined as the ratio of the expected dose (i.e., the overall amount of the intervention offered specified in the trial protocol) to duration (in months). Adjusting the expected dose by average adherence enables estimation of the observed dose and intensity, which could be informative for identifying optimal dosage thresholds that maximize cognitive benefits across different populations. Finally, this article provides an overview of the determinants of adherence to multimodal interventions, emphasizing the need for improved adherence reporting to inform the design and implementation of precision prevention interventions.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40094842,Oral Health Status and Factors Associated with Oral Health in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Matched Case-Control Observational Study.,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, ranking as the seventh leading cause of death in both sexes. There is increasing awareness of the role of chronic periodontal disease and severe tooth loss as a modifiable risk factor for developing AD. The aim of the present observational study was to assess AD patients with non-affected healthy controls in the context of their dental and periodontal health outcomes; additionally, the potential impact of anamnestic factors and lifestyle habits on oral health outcomes was also studied. Methods: A total of n = 41 AD patients receiving treatment at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Szeged, were compared with n = 41 age- and gender-matched controls from individuals seeking dental treatment and from retirement homes (mean age was 83.32 ± 7.82 years). Dental and periodontal status indices were assessed according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results: Overall, 51.2%, 68.3%, and 87.8% of AD patients received mood stabilizers, drugs for their non-cognitive symptoms and cognitive symptoms, respectively. Severe tooth loss was observed in 43.9% of AD patients and 56.1% of controls, respectively. There were no significant differences among AD patients and controls regarding the dental status indices studied (p &gt; 0.05 for all indicators). AD patients had significantly higher plaque indices (%) (59.06 ± 15.45 vs. 41.35 ± 7.97; p &lt; 0.001), bleeding on probing (BOP%) (62.65 ± 12.00 vs. 40.12 ± 10.86; p &lt; 0.001), pocket depth [PD] (2.63 ± 0.56 vs. 2.29 ± 0.13; p = 0.002) and attachment loss [AL] (2.85 ± 0.79 vs. 2.39 ± 0.41; p = 0.026) values, compared to controls. Smoking (vs. non-smokers; 56.28 ± 12.36 vs. 51.40 ± 13.23, p = 0.038) and consumption of alcohol (vs. non-drinkers; 58.68 ± 9.86 vs. 54.78 ± 14.86, p = 0.040) were associated with higher plaque indices [%], while no similar effects were shown for dental status parameters (p &gt; 0.05). In contrast, coffee intake and vitamin supplement use had no significant effect on dental or periodontal status parameters (p &gt; 0.05 in all cases). Conclusions: The results of our study underscore the substantial treatment needs of AD patients, calling for heightened awareness among dental healthcare professionals.",J Clin Med,2025
39761530,Plasma pTau181 and amyloid markers predict conversion to dementia in idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder.,"Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology have been intensively investigated as markers for AD-related neurodegeneration. Comorbid AD pathology is common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Accordingly, we hypothesized that plasma biomarkers associated with AD pathology might be useful to predict DLB in a cohort of idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), an incipient synucleinopathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether plasma amyloid-β and pTau181 biomarkers can predict DLB. This longitudinal single-center (Canada) cohort study included 158 polysomnography-confirmed iRBD individuals between September 2004 and October 2022, each providing blood plasma samples, who were then offered prospective follow-up. Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42 and pTau181 levels were measured using NeuroToolKit, a prototype assays panel of neurodegeneration (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd). The primary outcome was the association between plasma biomarkers at baseline and eventual development of DLB. Correlations between plasma markers and baseline cognitive tests were assessed. A total of 142 iRBD participants (109 men [77%], mean ± SD age, 67.6 ± 8.0 years) were included in the final analysis. On prospective follow-up (2.9 ± 2.1 years after sampling), 32 individuals phenoconverted to a defined neurodegenerative syndrome (18 DLB, 13 PD, 1 MSA). The combined phenoconvertor group had lower baseline plasma Aβ42/40 ratio compared to non-phenoconvertors (mean ± SD, 0.103 ± 0.010 vs. 0.114 ± 0.012, p < 0.001), and higher pTau181 levels (0.993 ± 0.354 vs. 0.784 ± 0.266pg/ml, p = 0.008). When divided by phenoconversion subtype, significant differences were seen selectively in DLB-convertors (Aβ42/40 = 0.101 ± 0.010, difference -0.011, 95% CI [-0.016; -0.005], p < 0.001; pTau181 = 1.144 ± 0.326 pg/ml, difference 0.282 pg/ml, 95% CI [0.146; 0.418], p < 0.001). Cross-sectional analysis showed that plasma pTau181 (but not Aβ42/40) correlated with cognitive tests across various domains. Our results indicate that plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and pTau181 can predict conversion to DLB in iRBD.",Brain,2025
40038194,Deciphering the Neuroprotective Action of Bee Venom Peptide Melittin: Insights into Mechanistic Interplay.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal structure and function. These conditions often lead to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and ultimately severe impairment of daily activities. A key feature of neurodegenerative diseases is chronic inflammation, which contributes to neuronal damage and exacerbates disease progression. Traditional treatments mainly focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying causes, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Melittin, a bioactive peptide derived from bee venom, has garnered attention for its multifaceted neuroprotective properties, particularly in the context of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms through which melittin exerts neuroprotective effects, with a focus on its ability to modulate neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. Research indicates that melittin can downregulate pro-apoptotic pathways by inhibiting calpain-mediated activation of apoptosis-inducing factor and Bax, thereby reducing neuronal cell death. Additionally, melittin exerts its neuroprotective effects through the inhibition of neuroinflammatory processes, specifically by downregulating key inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. This modulation leads to decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Beyond its anti-inflammatory actions, melittin promotes neurogenesis, potentially through the modulation of the BDNF/Trk-B/CREB signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in neuronal survival and plasticity. These properties suggest that melittin not only provides symptomatic relief but could also address the root causes of neuronal degeneration, presenting a promising avenue for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is required to validate its efficacy and safety in clinical settings.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39992588,Identification and Validation of Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Based on Akt and Wnt Signaling Pathways in Mouse Models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that remains challenging to treat. Akt and Wnt play a role in complex cellular signaling, which is crucial for examining the onset of AD. In this study, we aimed to identify and analyze Akt pathway-related genes (ARGs) and Wnt pathway-related genes (WRGs) as AD biomarkers, determine the effects of ARGs and WRGs on AD, and verify these effects in AD mouse models. We searched for differentially expressed genes in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, constructed candidate gene protein-protein interaction networks, and used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm to screen key genes. Correlation and functional similarity analyses of key genes, immune infiltration analysis, competing endogenous RNA network construction, and drug prediction of key genes were performed. Expression of key genes in streptozotocin-treated (STZ)-treated AD mice was validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatics analysis identified five key genes in AD: PRKACA, CDH3, ATP6V0C, DLL1, and CELSR2. Step-down tests, immunohistochemistry, and silver plate staining confirmed successful treatment of STZ-induced AD in mice. According to RT-qPCR analysis, the relative expression of DLL1 mRNA in AD mice was higher than that in control mice, whereas the relative expression of ATP6V0C and PRKACA mRNA in AD mice was lower than that in control mice; this was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis (p < 0.05). This study screened and validated AD biomarkers associated with the Akt and Wnt pathways in mouse models.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39898324,Causal relationships between hippocampal volumetric traits and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Alzheimer's disease, a common and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with alterations in hippocampal volume, as revealed by neuroimaging research. However, the causal links between the volumes of the hippocampus and its subfield structures with Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. A genetic correlation analysis using linkage disequilibrium score regression was conducted to identify hippocampal volumetric traits linked to Alzheimer's disease. Following this, to examine the causal links between Alzheimer's disease and hippocampal volumetric traits, we applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach, utilizing a bidirectional framework. Seven hippocampal volumetric traits were found as genetically correlated with Alzheimer's disease in the genetic correlation analysis and were then included in the Mendelian randomization analyses. Inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that increased volumes in the left whole hippocampus, left hippocampal body, right presubiculum head and right cornu ammonis 1 head were causally related to higher risks of Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease was causally associated with decreased volumes of the left hippocampal body and left whole hippocampus. These results were validated through other Mendelian randomization approaches and sensitivity analysis. Our findings uncover bidirectional causal relationships between Alzheimer's disease and hippocampal volumetric traits, suggesting not only the potential significance of these traits in predicting Alzheimer's disease but also the reciprocal influence of Alzheimer's disease on hippocampal volumes.",Brain Commun,2025
40181078,Polygenic score analysis identifies distinct genetic risk profiles in Alzheimer's disease comorbidities.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually accompanied by comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), epilepsy, major depressive disorder (MDD), and migraine headaches (MH) that can significantly affect patient management and progression. As AD, these comorbidities have their own cumulative common genetic risk component that can be explored in a single individual through polygenic scores. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank, we investigated the correlation between polygenic scores (PGS) for these comorbidities and their actual presentation in AD patients. We show that individuals with higher PGS values showed an elevated risk of developing T2D (OR 2.1, p = 1.07 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) and epilepsy (OR 1.5, p = 0.0176). High T2D-PGS is also associated with an earlier AD onset in individuals at high genetic risk for AD (AD-PGS). In contrast, no significant genetic associations were found for MDD and MH. Our findings show distinct common genetic risk factors for T2D and epilepsy carried by AD patients that are associated with increased prevalence and earlier disease onset. These results highlight the contribution of common genetic variation to the broader clinical landscape of AD and will contribute to future tailored patient management strategies for individuals at high genetic risk.",Sci Rep,2025

39744805,Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers and physical functioning in a diverse sample of adults.,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers, and physical functioning (PF) across diverse races and ethnicities remains unclear. This study aims to explore this association in an ethno-racially diverse sample of cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling adults.
METHODS: Data clinical examinations, neuropsychological tests, blood draws, and PF exams (Timed Up and Go [TUG] and Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]) were analyzed. Multivariable linear regressions assessed the association between PF and AD plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ]40, Aβ42, total tau [t-tau], neurofiliament light chain [NfL]).
RESULTS: The sample (n = 2358; mean age 64.7 years; 65.9% female), was 20% African American, 41.9% non-Hispanic White, and 38.1% Hispanic. Findings indicate that worse PF is linked to higher biomarker levels (p < 0.05). Associations differed by race and ethnicity group. TUG time was associated (p < 0.05) with Aβ40, Aβ42, and tau among non-Hispanic Whites, whereas SPPB scores were associated (p < 0.05) with t-tau and NfL among African Americans.
DISCUSSION: PF, ethnic/racial, and plasma AD biomarker data should be used to aid in developing risk profiles for neurodegenerative diseases.

39759399,The study on cuproptosis in Alzheimer's disease based on the cuproptosis key gene FDX1.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairments. Previous studies have shown neuronal death in the brains of AD patients, but the role of cuproptosis and its associated genes in AD neurons remains unclear.
METHODS: Intersection analysis was conducted using the AD transcriptome dataset GSE63060, neuron dataset GSE147528, and reported cuproptosis-related genes to identify the cuproptosis key gene FDX1 highly expressed in AD. Subsequently, cell experiments were performed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> to establish AD cell model. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) assays were employed to detect the expression levels of FDX1, DLAT, and DLST. Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting Kit-8 (CCK8), mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. shRNA was used to downregulate FDX1 expression, followed by repetition of the aforementioned experiments. Clinical experiments utilized qPCR to detect FDX1 mRNA levels in peripheral venous blood of patients, and analyzed FDX1 expression differences in different APOE genotypes of AD patients. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FDX1 was constructed based on the GeneMANIA database, immune infiltration analysis was conducted using R language, and transcription factors prediction for FDX1 was performed based on the ENCODE database.
RESULTS: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 showed significantly higher expression in peripheral blood and neuron models of AD compared to non-AD individuals, with significantly higher expression in APOE ε4/ε4 genotype than other APOE genotype of AD patients. Knockdown of FDX1 expression reduced the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST in neurons, alleviated ROS accumulation in mitochondria, improved cell viability, and mitigated cuproptosis. Immune infiltration analysis results indicated a high enrichment of peripheral blood γδ-T lymphocytes in AD, and FDX1 was significantly associated with the infiltration of four immune cells and may be regulated by three transcription factors.
CONCLUSION: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 is highly expressed in AD and may promote cuproptosis in AD neurons by regulating the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST, thereby participating in the onset and development of AD. This provides a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024

This study assessed the potential of plasma biomarkers for differential diagnosis.
METHODS: This cohort study included 374 participants (96 AD, 278 FTLD). Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)<sub>217</sub>, neurofilament light chain (NfL), brain-derived tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the amyloid beta<sub>1-42</sub>/<sub>1-40</sub> ratio were measured. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses assessed diagnostic accuracy, and a three-range threshold approach was used to stratify patients based on the most accurate biomarker.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau<sub>217</sub> effectively distinguished AD from FTLD, with the NfL/p-tau<sub>217</sub> ratio showing superior accuracy. The three-range approach identified thresholds with 95% and 97.5% sensitivity and specificity, reducing the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing by 75% and 54%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau<sub>217</sub> and the NfL/p-tau<sub>217</sub> ratio are promising non-invasive biomarkers for differentiating AD from FTLD, suggesting their use as a potential alternative to traditional diagnostic methods.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)<sub>217</sub> distinguishes Alzheimer's disease (AD) from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with high accuracy.

39711331,Factors associated with care-resistant behavior in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set.,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the factors associated with care-resistant behavior in community-dwelling persons living with dementia.
METHODS: Regression modeling was performed on 41,143 responses to a standardized questionnaire from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set.
RESULTS: In the fully adjusted mixed-effects regression model, collinearity was low, with no variance inflation factor above 1.15. Moderate (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50, 1.69) and severe (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.82, 2.09) dementia severity; and Black (aOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.47, 1.82), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), frontotemporal (aOR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.49) and Lewy body dementia (aOR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.29) diagnosis type were associated with a higher odds of care-resistant behavior. Female sex (aOR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91) and higher education (aOR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.97) were associated with lower odds of care-resistant behavior.
DISCUSSION: Interventions to manage care-resistant behaviors should consider sociocultural factors as well as type of dementia diagnosis to limit caregiver strain and burden.
HIGHLIGHTS: Frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Black race were associated with a higher likelihood of exhibiting care-resistant behavior. Female sex and higher educational attainment were associated with a lower likelihood of exhibiting care-resistant behavior. Differences in specific presentations of care-resistant behaviors are less understood.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40156279,Accountable care organizations and Medicare payments for residents with ADRD in disadvantaged neighborhoods.,"INTRODUCTION: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are well positioned to promote care coordination. However, robust evidence of ACOs' impact on Medicare payments for residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in disadvantaged neighborhoods remains limited.
METHODS: Using a 2016 to 2020 longitudinal dataset, we examined the effects of ACO enrollment on Medicare payments for people newly diagnosed with ADRD, focusing on the neighborhood Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and its subcategories. Multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were applied.
RESULTS: ACO enrollment was associated with significantly reduced total payments across all SVI subcategories. The highest cost savings were observed among ADRD patients living in neighborhoods with high proportions of racial and ethnic minorities. Results also showed that higher quality ACOs were associated with lower total payments.
DISCUSSION: ACOs have a great potential to save health-care costs for beneficiaries with ADRD living in socially vulnerable neighborhoods, particularly for those residing in areas with higher proportions of racial and ethnic minority populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) reduced Medicare payments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias across neighborhood disadvantage levels. The cost reductions varied by specific indicators of social vulnerability. Highest cost savings were found among residents living with high proportion of racial/ethnic minorities. Cost savings were the greatest among the highest quality ACOs.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39924865,Short communication: Evaluating roles of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein as Alzheimer's disease biomarker in real-world multi-center memory clinics in Thailand.,"The roles of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the correlation between plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and amyloid-β are emerging. Among 133 patients with cognitive complaints from multi-center memory clinics in Thailand, 73 had AD as defined either by cerebrospinal fluid core biomarkers or amyloid PET. Plasma GFAP demonstrated an AUC of 0.74 (95%CI: 0.65-0.83) for detecting AD and showed large effects on identifying AD status with Cohen's d = 0.81 (95%CI 0.44-1.18). LOESS regression illustrated that plasma GFAP increased from the early stages of AD. Plasma GFAP has potential applications across diverse populations.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39822593,Statin use and dementia risk: A systematic review and updated meta-analysis.,"UNLABELLED: Dementia affects 55 million people globally, with the number projected to triple by 2050. Statins, widely prescribed for cardiovascular benefits, may also have neuroprotective effects, although studies on their impact on dementia risk have shown contradictory results. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We assessed the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD), with subgroup analyses by gender, statin type, and diabetes status. Fifty-five observational studies including over 7 million patients were analyzed. Statin use significantly reduced the risk of dementia compared to nonusers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82 to 0.91; p &lt; 0.001). It was also associated with reduced risks of AD (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.90; p &lt; 0.001) and VaD (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.02; p = 0.093). Subgroup analyses revealed significant dementia risk reductions among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; p &lt; 0.001), those with exposure to statins for more than 3 years (HR 0.37; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.46; p &lt; 0.001), and populations from Asia, where the greatest protective effect was observed (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.88). Additionally, rosuvastatin demonstrated the most pronounced protective effect for all-cause dementia among specific statins (HR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.88). Our findings underscore the neuroprotective potential of statins in dementia prevention. Despite the inherent limitations of observational studies, the large dataset and detailed subgroup analyses enhance the reliability of our results. Future randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings and enlighten clinical guidelines.
HIGHLIGHTS: Largest meta-analysis to date on statins and dementia risk, including 55 studies and more than 7 million patients.Statin use linked to lower risks of all-dementia, AD, and VaD.Numerous significant subgroup results highlight statins' diverse neuroprotective effects.Findings support statins as a public health tool, especially in low-income countries.Future research should explore the impact of statins across diverse patient populations.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39811701,Computerized cognitive testing to capture cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: Longitudinal findings from the ARMADA study.,"INTRODUCTION: Timely detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD) -related cognitive decline has become a public health priority. We investigated whether the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function-Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) detects AD-related cognitive decline.
METHODS: N = 171 participants (age 76.5 ± 8; 53% female, 34% Aβ-positive) from the ARMADA study completed the NIHTB-CB at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Linear mixed-effect models correcting for demographics were used to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal NIHTB-CB scores in individuals across the clinical AD spectrum.
RESULTS: Compared to Aβ-negative healthy controls, Aβ-positive individuals with amnestic MCI or mild AD performed worse on all NIHTB-CB measures and showed an accelerated decline in processing speed, working memory, and auditory word comprehension tests.
DISCUSSION: These findings support the use of the NIHTB-CB in early AD, but also imply that the optimal NIHTB-CB composite score to detect change over time may differ across clinical stages of AD. Future directions include replication of these findings in larger and more demographically diverse samples.
HIGHLIGHTS: We examined NIH Toolbox-Cognition Battery scores across the clinical AD spectrum.All NIH Toolbox tests detected cross-sectional cognitive impairment in MCI-to-mild AD.Three NIH Toolbox tests captured further decline over time in MCI-to-mild AD.The NIH Toolbox can facilitate timely detection of AD-related cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40194084,Essential Tremor with Tau Pathology Features Seeds Indistinguishable in Conformation from Alzheimer's Disease and Primary Age-related Tauopathy (S21.006).,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the conformation of tau assemblies in essential tremor (ET) patients with tau pathology using a tau biosensor alanine (Ala) scanning approach, and to determine their structural similarity to tau assemblies in other tauopathies.
BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative tauopathies are characterized by distinct tau fibril structures that correlate with specific neuropathological phenotypes. ET, a progressive neurological disease, is associated with an elevated risk of dementia in cohort studies. Published postmortem studies demonstrate a higher tau burden in ET than matched controls. Understanding the structure of tau assemblies in ET may aid in developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, particularly in patients with cognitive decline.
DESIGN/METHODS: Eighteen ET patient brains with tau pathology were studied using tau biosensor assays, which measure tau seeding activity after incubation with brain homogenate. The structural classification of tau seeds was conducted using an Ala scanning approach, which systematically introduced serial Ala point substitutions in the tau monomer and then evaluated the incorporation of each mutant into seeded aggregates from ET patients. The results for ET cases were compared to other tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), primary age-related tauopathy (PART), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
RESULTS: Tau seeding above 5% was detected in 9 out of 18 patients (50.0%), and only one case had concurrent high amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology. The amino acid requirements for tau monomer incorporation into aggregates from ET brains in our biosensor cells were identical to those found in AD and PART, but distinct from tau seeds in CBD, CTE, and PSP.
CONCLUSIONS: The tau assemblies in a subset of ET cases with significant tau pathology share structural features with those in AD and PART, suggesting a commonality in tau pathology across these conditions. This finding may lead to more accurate diagnoses and tailored therapies for ET patients experiencing cognitive impairment. Disclosure: Dr. Saez Calveras has nothing to disclose.

39794315,Electrophysiology-based screening identifies neuronal HtrA serine peptidase 2 (HTRA2) as a synaptic plasticity regulator participating in tauopathy.,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are widely used to study synaptic plasticity. However, whether proteins regulating LTP and LTD are altered in cognitive disorders and contribute to disease onset remains to be determined. Herein, we induced LTP and LTD in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral pathway, respectively, and then performed proteomic analysis of the CA1 region. We identified 20 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) shared by the LTP and the LTD processes. Among them, we found that HtrA serine peptidase 2 (HTRA2) was mainly expressed in neurons and that HTRA2 levels were increased in both the LTP and the LTD processes in C57BL/6 mice. HTRA2 downregulation impaired synapses and reduced ATP production in cultured primary neurons. Furthermore, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated HTRA2 downregulation in the hippocampus impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, we found that HTRA2 expression decreased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions patients, and tauopathy model mice. Finally, we showed that lentivirus-mediated HTRA2 overexpression in the hippocampus rescued PP2B reduction, alleviated tau hyperphosphorylation, and partially attenuated synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits in the PS19 tauopathy model mice. Our study not only indicates that HTRA2 in neurons plays an important role in regulating synaptic plasticity under both physiological and pathological conditions, but also provides a novel, electrophysiology-based strategy to identify proteins regulating synaptic plasticity systematically.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
39913137,Alzheimer Disease Blood Biomarkers and Cognition Among Individuals With Diabetes and Overweight or Obesity.,"IMPORTANCE: Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) are clinically available to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD), but their association with cognition among older adults with specific chronic conditions has not been examined.
OBJECTIVE: To longitudinally examine associations between baseline AD and ADRD BBMs and change in BBMs with cognition among participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight or obesity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study was a clinical trial of older adults with T2D and overweight or obesity randomized to a 10-year intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss or a diabetes support and education condition. Participants were recruited and followed up at 16 clinical sites across the US. Enrollment occurred from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2004. The primary intervention spanned the first 4 years after participants' enrollment (January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011). The clinical trial was stopped in September 2012 and was converted to an observational study. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and 8 to 12 years later. Cognitive assessments were performed from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, and from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. Data for the present cohort study were analyzed between January and August 2024.
EXPOSURES: Baseline and 8- to 12-year change in plasma levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)40, Aβ42, Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau-181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cognitive composite z score and adjudicated mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) baseline age of 758 participants was 61.5 (6.1) years, and 424 participants [55.9%] were female. Mean (SD) body mass index was 34.8 (5.3). Of the participants, 373 were randomized to diabetes support and education and 385 to intensive lifestyle intervention. Increasing baseline BBM levels were not associated with any cognitive composite z score. Increasing levels of NfL (β = -0.032 [SE, 0.013]; P = .01) and GFAP (β = -0.087 [SE, 0.025]; P < .001), but not the Aβ42/40 ratio (β = 0.006 [SE, 0.040]; P = .88) or pTau-181 (β = 0.026 [SE, 0.025]; P = .31), were associated with worsening cognitive function and incident mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. The intervention had no association with 8- to 12-year change in BBM levels.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of participants with T2D and overweight or obesity, increasing plasma NfL and GFAP levels over time, but not Aβ42/40 or pTau-181 levels, were associated with cognitive decline and incident cognitive impairment. These results suggest that plasma NfL and GFAP may be important biomarkers of cognitive change among this patient population.",JAMA Netw Open,2025
39910867,Effects of whole-head 810 nm near-infrared therapy on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: A pilot study.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by significant cognitive and behavioral impairments. Near-infrared (NIR) light treatment has shown potential in cognitive improvement in previous studies. However, clinical trials of NIR for AD remain limited.ObjectiveThis study investigated the safety and effects of whole-head 810 nm NIR therapy in AD patients, including long-term efficacy.MethodsAn open-label pilot study on whole-head NIR treatment for AD patients was conducted. Nine AD patients completed 4-month treatment (810 nm, 100 mW/cm², 30 min/session, 6 sessions weekly). Safety and efﬁcacy were evaluated at baseline, months 2 and 4, and 2-month post-treatment.ResultsAfter four months of whole-head NIR treatment, mean changes from baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination were 3.2 (p = 0.02). Mean changes from baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive were -5.0 (p = 0.05), mean changes from baseline on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment were 1.9 (p = 0.12). Mean changes from baseline on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were -4.2 (p = 0.47). These benefits were sustained two months at least. With no device-related adverse effects were reported.ConclusionsWhole-head 810 nm NIR light is safe and offers promising benefits for AD patients. To fully confirm its efficacy, durability, and underlying mechanisms, further large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40145329,Updates and future perspectives on neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum and profoundly affect patients, caregivers, and health-care systems. This review synthesizes key research presented in the 2022 and 2023 Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Neuropsychiatric Syndromes-Professional Interest Area (NPS-PIA) Year-In-Reviews, emphasizing six critical areas: (1) diversity and disparities, (2) diagnostic frameworks, (3) neurobiology of NPS, (4) NPS as a disease marker, (5) the impact of COVID-19, and (6) interventions. NPS accelerates AD progression, increases functional decline, diminishes quality of life, and heightens caregiver burden and institutionalization rates. Current treatments primarily rely on psychotropics, which offer limited efficacy and raise safety concerns. This review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about recent NPS advancements while identifying gaps for future studies to improve outcomes for individuals with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Research in Alzheimer's disease-related neuropsychiatric symptoms has rapidly increased, indicating heightened interest. Key areas include: diversity, diagnostics, markers, COVID-19 impact, and treatments. A road map for future studies, based on the key areas of research, is provided. This road map includes considerations to improve study applicability and validity.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40155644,Gadolinium based contrast agent induced electrical conductivity heterogeneity analysis in the brain of Alzheimer's disease.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often uses gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to improve the characterization of imaging contrast, owing to their strong paramagnetic properties. Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) visualizes the conductivity distribution of biological tissues at the Larmor frequency using the [Formula: see text] field phase signal. In this paper, we investigate the effect of GBCA on brain conductivity. To compare the differences of reconstructed noisy conductivity maps before and after the GBCA injection, we propose a method to remove the background low-frequency noise artifact based on an elliptic partial differential equation. By analyzing the relationship between electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, the objective of this study is to develop a cost-effective and accessible initial screening imaging tool for diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. To investigate vascular damage in AD, we define a conductivity heterogeneity volume fraction (CHVF) caused by GBCA leakage. Using CHVF, we develop three indices to characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. To verify the proposed method, we studied a total of 42 participants, including 14 individuals diagnosed with AD, 18 participants with MCI, and 10 cognitively normal (CN) participants. Finally, we designed a radar chart informed by the CHVF analysis, to exhibit the pertinent parameters for MCI and AD patients, facilitating the evaluation and ongoing monitoring of each patient's diagnosis and treatment regimen.",Sci Rep,2025
39898325,"The relationship between leisure time physical activity patterns, Alzheimer's disease markers and cognition.","We assessed the association between leisure time physical activity patterns across 30 years of adulthood with a range of in vivo Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegenerative markers and cognition, and their interplay, at age 70. Participants from the 1946 British birth cohort study prospectively reported leisure time physical activity five times between ages 36 and 69 and were dichotomized into (i) not active (no participation/month) and (ii) active (participated once or more/month) and further derived into: (0) never active (not active); (1) active before 50's only (≤43 years); (2) active from 50's onwards only (≥53 years); (3) always active (active throughout). Participants underwent 18F-florbetapir Aβ and magnetic resonance imaging at age 70. Regression analyses were conducted to assess the direct and the moderating relationship between leisure time physical activity metrics, Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration markers (including Aβ status, hippocampal and whole-brain volume, and cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease signature regions) and cognition. All models were adjusted for childhood cognition, education and childhood socioeconomic position, and examined by sex. Findings drawn from 468 participants (49% female) demonstrated a direct association between being active before 50 years old (≤43 years) and throughout life (up to age 69 years), with larger hippocampal volume at age 70 (P &lt; 0.05). There was little evidence that leisure time physical activity had direct effects on other brain health measures (all P &gt; 0.05). However, leisure time physical activity patterns modified and attenuated the association between poorer cognitive functioning at age 70 and a range of Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegenerative markers (Aβ status; hippocampal and whole-brain volume; cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease regions) (all P &lt; 0.05). We found suggestive evidence that women with early markers of Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration were most sensitive to leisure time physical activity patterns: a lifetime of inactivity in women exacerbated the manifestation of early Alzheimer's disease markers (Aβ and cortical thickness-related cognition), yet, if women were active across life or early in life, it mostly buffered these negative relationships. Engagement in leisure time physical activity in the life course is associated with better cognitive functioning at age 70, even in those with early markers of Alzheimer's disease. If causal, this is likely via multiple pathways, potentially through the preservation of hippocampal volume, as well as via cognitive resilience pathways delaying cognitive manifestations of early markers of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. Our findings warrant further research to shed light on the mechanisms of physical activity as a potential disease-modifying intervention of brain health and cognitive resilience.",Brain Commun,2025
40081429,Functional dynamic network connectivity differentiates biological patterns in the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be conceptualized as a network-based syndrome. Network alterations are linked to the molecular hallmarks of AD, involving amyloid-beta and tau accumulation, and consecutively neurodegeneration. By combining molecular and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed whether different biological patterns of AD identified through a data-driven approach matched specific abnormalities in brain dynamic connectivity. We identified three main patient clusters. The first group displayed mild pathological alterations. The second cluster exhibited typical behavioral impairment alongside AD pathology. The third cluster demonstrated similar behavioral impairment but with a divergent tau (low) and neurodegeneration (high) profile. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed two connectivity patterns encompassing the default mode network and the occipito-temporal cortex, linked respectively with typical and atypical patterns. These results support the key association between macro-scale and molecular alterations. Dynamic connectivity markers can assist in identifying patients with AD-like clinical profiles but with different underlying pathologies.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39875385,Polygenic burden of short tandem repeat expansions promotes risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Studies of the genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions. However, most of the disease heritability has yet to be uncovered, suggesting that there is substantial genetic risk conferred by other forms of genetic variation. There are over one million short tandem repeats (STRs) in the genome, and their link to AD risk has not been assessed. As pathogenic expansions of STR cause over 30 neurologic diseases, it is important to ascertain whether STRs may also be implicated in AD risk. Here, we genotype 312,731 polymorphic STR tracts genome-wide using PCR-free whole genome sequencing data from 2981 individuals (1489 AD case and 1492 control individuals). We implement an approach to identify STR expansions as STRs with tract lengths that are outliers from the population. We then test for differences in aggregate burden of expansions in case versus control individuals. AD patients harbor a 1.19-fold increase of STR expansions compared to healthy elderly controls (p = 8.27×10<sup>-3</sup>, two-sided Mann-Whitney test). Individuals carrying &gt;30 STR expansions have a 3.69-fold higher odds of having AD and have more severe AD neuropathology. AD STR expansions are highly enriched within active promoters in post-mortem hippocampal brain tissues and particularly within SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposons. Together, these results demonstrate that expanded STRs within active promoter regions of the genome associate with risk of AD.",Nat Commun,2025

In a cohort of 74 consecutive patients, plasma p-Tau181 levels were significantly higher in AD compared to non-AD groups and showed correlation with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Plasma p-Tau181 demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for AD, with an area under the curve of 0.854. The findings suggest that plasma biomarkers, particularly p-Tau181, could improve the accessibility and efficiency of AD diagnostics in clinical settings, offering a less invasive and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40004695,"Essential Tremor and Mortality in Older Adults: The Role of Word Recall, a Measure of Episodic Memory, in a 23-Year Follow-Up Study.","Background: The association between essential tremor (ET) and mortality risk remains uncertain. This study investigated the impact of episodic memory performance, measured through a word recall task, on mortality risk in ET within the Neurological Disorders in Central Spain (NEDICES) cohort, a population-based study of older adults. Methods: Participants were followed until death or 31 December 2017, and divided into four groups based on ET status and memory performance (errors in the 37-Minimental Examination's three-word recall task). Cox proportional hazards models estimated mortality hazard ratios (HRs), and the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI) assessed additive interactions. Results: Among 3998 participants, 3432 (85.8%) died over a median follow-up of 11.2 years. ET patients with episodic memory impairments had a higher mortality risk (HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06-1.46) compared with controls with similar deficits (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09-1.28), whereas no significant increase was observed for ET patients without memory impairments (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.74-1.21). RERI analysis revealed no significant additive interaction between ET and memory impairment (fully adjusted RERI: 0.11 [95% CI: -0.19-0.41]). Episodic memory impairments, regardless of ET status, were strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease as a primary cause of death. Conclusions: These findings highlight the independent contribution of episodic memory impairment to increased mortality risk, with ET modestly amplifying this effect without significant interaction. Further research is needed to explore shared pathophysiological mechanisms between ET and neurodegenerative conditions.",J Clin Med,2025
39968707,Unlocking ocular biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that ocular testing holds promise as a non-invasive and cost-effective method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). After interviews with neurologists, optometrists, primary care physicians, and ophthalmologists, the potential for ocular biomarker testing to become a standard clinical practice in the future was assessed. Ocular tests offer a non-invasive alternative to blood-based testing, capturing a substantial niche of ≈ 4 to 8 million individuals in the United States during routine eye exams. Technical requirements for broad adoption include high accuracy comparable to blood-based tests and 510(k) clearance. Ocular biomarker technology must meet the practical requirements of optometrists and ophthalmologists, including ease of implementation, automation, and a clear path to profitability. A sufficient body of evidence to support guideline inclusion, reimbursement, and clinical actionability will facilitate the adoption. As the field evolves, advances such as earlier detection of preclinical AD may further expand the role of ocular testing. HIGHLIGHTS: Ocular biomarkers offer another non-invasive alternative to blood-based Alzheimer's disease testing. Wide adoption will require accuracy akin to blood-based tests and 510(k) clearance. Ocular screening could benefit ≈ 4 to 8 million US individuals conducting routine eye exams. Current ocular offerings remain nascent, and advances could expand this reach. New technology must show ease of implementation, automation, and a path to profit.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39755674,Neuropathology-based approach reveals novel Alzheimer's Disease genes and highlights female-specific pathways and causal links to disrupted lipid metabolism: insights into a vicious cycle.,"Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
39964584,Visual Analysis of Research Hotspots and Trends on Mitochondria-Associated Membranes in the Past 20 Years-Focused on Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), which play a crucial role in regulating intracellular signal transduction and molecular interactions. This study employs bibliometric analysis to examine the research progress on MAMS and identify research hotspots and trends. A total of 1406 publications on MAMs were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection. Software such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Scimago Graphica were utilized in the bibliometric analysis process. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of over 20 years of MAM research, identifying the countries, institutions, authors, journals, and publications involved in the field. The number of publications on MAMs has been increasing annually since 2010, exhibiting a steady upward trend. The main contributors to this field are the USA, China, and Italy, with the journal Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology publishing the most publications. Common keywords include ""endoplasmic reticulum stress,"" ""Ca2 + ,"" ""mitofusin2,"" ""oxidative stress,"" ""apoptosis,"" ""autophagy,"" and ""Alzheimer's disease."" We found that the role of MAMs in neurodegenerative diseases has aroused great interest among researchers. The associations between calcium homeostasis, autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death with MAMs are also considered research hotspots and show broad research prospects. In addition, changes in MAM-resident proteins, including the mitochondria-ER tethering complex, Mfn2, and Sig-1R, have been highlighted as prominent research directions. The findings provide a comprehensive overview of research on MAMs and valuable insights for researchers, which is helpful for exploring future directions and trends in this field.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39713875,Plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> is sensitive to early cerebral amyloid accumulation and predicts risk of cognitive decline across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.,"INTRODUCTION: The availability of amyloid beta (Aβ) targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing the demand for scalable biomarkers that are sensitive to early cerebral Aβ accumulation.
METHODS: We evaluated fully-automated Lumipulse plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> immunoassays for detecting cerebral Aβ in 457 clinically unimpaired (CU) and clinically impaired (CI) Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Stanford ADRC) participants and 186 CU in the Stanford Aging and Memory Study (SAMS). Longitudinal change in ADRC plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> and cognition and cross-sectional associations with SAMS memory and tau positron emission tomography (PET) were examined.
RESULTS: Plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> exhibited high performance in detecting amyloid positivity defined by PET (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.885, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.816-0.955). Once abnomal, plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> remained low and predicted cognitive decline in both CU and CI individuals. Among SAMS CU, plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> was associated with poorer hippocampal-dependent memory and elevated tau accumulation.
DISCUSSION: Lumipulse plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> is a scalable assay for detection of cerebral Aβ and prediction of risk for cognitive decline across the AD continuum.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lumipulse plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> exhibited high accuracy in detecting amyloid positivity.

39951525,Interpretable AI for inference of causal molecular relationships from omics data.,"The discovery of molecular relationships from high-dimensional data is a major open problem in bioinformatics. Machine learning and feature attribution models have shown great promise in this context but lack causal interpretation. Here, we show that a popular feature attribution model, under certain assumptions, estimates an average of a causal quantity reflecting the direct influence of one variable on another. We leverage this insight to propose a precise definition of a gene regulatory relationship and implement a new tool, CIMLA (Counterfactual Inference by Machine Learning and Attribution Models), to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods. Last, we use CIMLA to analyze a previously published single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), discovering several potential regulators of AD.",Sci Adv,2025
39813142,Anterior-temporal network hyperconnectivity is key to Alzheimer's disease: from ageing to dementia.,"Curing Alzheimer's disease remains hampered by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and progression. Exploring dysfunction in medial temporal lobe networks, particularly the anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) systems, may provide key insights, as these networks exhibit functional connectivity alterations along the entire Alzheimer's continuum, potentially influencing disease propagation. However, the specific changes in each network and their clinical relevance across stages are not yet fully understood. This requires considering commonly used biomarkers, clinical progression, individual variability, and age confounds. Here, we leveraged monocentric longitudinal data from 261 participants spanning the adult lifespan and the Alzheimer's continuum. The sample included cognitively unimpaired adults aged 19 to 85 years (n = 209; eight out of 64 older adults over 60 were Aβ-positive) and Aβ-positive patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 26; 18 progressed to Alzheimer-dementia within seven years) or Alzheimer's type dementia (n = 26). Participants underwent structural and resting-state functional (f) MRI, florbetapir and FDG-PET, and global cognitive assessments, with up to three visits over a maximum period of 47 months. Network connectivity was assessed using seed-based analyses with the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices as seeds, within data-driven masks reflecting the AT and PM networks. Generalized additive and linear mixed models were run to assess age-specific effects and Alzheimer's-related alterations. In this context, we explored various markers of pathological and clinical severity, including cerebral amyloid uptake, glucose metabolism, hippocampal volume, global cognition, diagnostic staging, and time to dementia onset. Our findings revealed distinct patterns of connectivity linked to normal aging or Alzheimer's disease. Advancing age throughout adulthood was associated with lower PM connectivity and more subtle changes in AT connectivity, while Alzheimer's disease was characterised by AT hyperconnectivity without global changes in PM connectivity. Specifically, AT connectivity was higher in MCI and Alzheimer-dementia patients compared to older controls and was positively associated with amyloid burden, glucose hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, and global cognitive deficits in older adults, ranging from unimpaired to demented. Additionally, higher AT connectivity correlated with faster progression to Alzheimer-dementia in MCI patients. This comprehensive approach allowed to reveal that excessive connectivity within the AT network is intrinsically linked to the pathological and clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease. These insights may guide future research to better understand cascading events leading to the disease and hold promise for developing prognostic tools and therapeutic interventions targeting these specific network alterations.",Brain,2025
40179065,Depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: A human post-mortem study.,"Depression is associated with persistent low mood. In mid to late life, it has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with evidence that depression might be an early manifestation of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms by which depression enhances AD development remain unknown, there are several features commonly seen in both diseases such as the presence of neuroinflammation. In this study, we aimed to identify whether neuroinflammation is increased in depression as observed in the early stages of AD by examining post-mortem human brain tissue. Post-mortem human brain tissue from 54 cases with depression and 37 controls without depression were retrieved from the Douglas Bell Canada Brain Bank. Sixteen early-stage AD cases defined as a Braak stage III-IV and 15 controls were sourced from the South West Dementia Brain Bank. Frozen tissue from the dorsal prefrontal cortex was obtained for all cases in order to measure inflammatory proteins (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α) and endothelial markers (ICAM-1, VCAM) using ELISA and MesoScale Multiplex Assays. In the depression group, increase of IL-6 and IL-10, and decrease of IL-1β were observed compared to controls, with no changes detected for the other cytokines and the endothelial markers. In early-stage AD cases, only increased ICAM-1 expression was found compared to controls, indicating endothelial activation as an early feature of AD. None of the cytokines measured showed alteration of their expression in early-stage AD cases. Depression, but not AD, was associated with evidence of neuroinflammation. Depression may increase AD risk through different mechanism(s) than inflammation.",PLoS One,2025
39860641,Plasma Endothelin-1 Levels: Non-Predictors of Alzheimer's Disease Reveal Age Correlation in African American Women.,"Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. Contributing biological factors that explain this disparity have been elusive. Moreover, non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of AD are needed. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstrictive factor linked to cerebral vascular disease pathology and neuronal injury, could provide insights to better understand racial disparities in AD. As a potent vasoconstrictive peptide that regulates contractions in smooth muscle, endothelial cells, and pericytes, ET-1 may result in cerebral vascular constriction, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion; over time, this may result in neuronal injury, contributing to the pathology of AD. The role of the ET-1 system as a driver of ethnic disparities in AD requires further investigation. In the United States (U.S.), ET-1 dysregulation in Hispanic/Latinx (H/L) ethnic populations has largely been unexplored. Genetics linking ET-1 dysregulation and racial disparities in AD also require further investigation. In this study, we examined the role of the ET-1 protein in human plasma as a potential biomarker with predictive value for correlating with the development of AD by age, race, and sex. Methods: We examined ET-1 protein levels using quantitative mass spectrometry in AA and NHW patients with AD, along with controls. Results: A partial correlation between age at draw and ET-1, stratified by race and sex, while controlling for AD status, was significant for female AAs (r = 0.385, p = 0.016). When the data were not stratified but controlled for AD status, the partial correlation between age at draw and ET-1 was not significant (r = 0.108, p = 0.259). Conclusions: Based on the small number of plasma specimens and no plasma specimens from H/L individuals with AD, we conclude that ET-1 was clearly not a significant factor in predicting AD in this study and will require a larger scale study for validation.",J Clin Med,2025
40132021,Aβ-driven nuclear pore complex dysfunction alters activation of necroptosis proteins in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"The emergence of Aβ pathology is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms and impact of Aβ in progression of the disease is unclear. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a multi-protein assembly in mammalian cells that regulates movement of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope; its function is shown to undergo age-dependent decline during normal aging and is also impaired in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Yet not much is known about the impact of Aβ on NPC function in neurons. Here, we examined NPC and nucleoporin (NUP) distribution and nucleocytoplasmic transport using a mouse model of AD (App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup>) that expresses Aβ in young animals. Our studies revealed that a time-dependent accumulation of intracellular Aβ corresponded with a reduction of NPCs and NUPs in the nuclear envelope which resulted in the degradation of the permeability barrier and inefficient segregation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins, and active transport. As a result of the NPC dysfunction App KI neurons become more vulnerable to inflammation-induced necroptosis - a programmed cell death pathway where the core components are activated via phosphorylation through nucleocytoplasmic shutting. Collectively, our data implicates Aβ in progressive impairment of nuclear pore function and further confirms that the protein complex is vulnerable to disruption in various neurodegenerative diseases and is a potential therapeutic target.",Elife,2025
39982688,Polypharmacology and Neuroprotective Effects of Gingerol in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that results in brain shrinkage and the death of brain cells. The search for new treatment agents with many targets is now crucial due to the insufficient effectiveness, and adverse effects, including pharmacokinetic issues of traditional AD medications. Although phytochemicals have anti-disease characteristics and thus are widely used and accepted by people, researchers have also determined some of their most beneficial functions. Sesquiterpenes, volatile oils, and aromatic ketones (gingerols) are abundant in ginger. The most pharmacologically active components of ginger are considered to be gingerols. These gingerols are the compounds that impart spicy characteristics to the plant. Besides, gingerols readily undergo dehydration and produce another class of compounds, shogaols. These gingerols, shogaols, and other compounds, like zingerone, are mainly responsible for their distinctive aroma and pharmacological effects. This review aims to delineate the therapeutic potentials of gingerol in different AD models by assessing available literature reporting its effect on various cellular and molecular pathways. Although ginger is well recognized as a non-toxic nutraceutical, existing clinical research lacks robust evidence to support its efficacy in treating NDs, including AD. Clinical studies did not provide sufficient data that supports its use in treating various NDs including AD. Therefore, further research is essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of ginger and its constituents, ultimately paving the way for its development as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39713873,Longitudinal cognitive performance of participants with sporadic early onset Alzheimer's disease from LEADS.,"INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) manifests prior to the age of 65, and affects 4%-8% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current analyses sought to examine longitudinal cognitive trajectories of participants with early-onset dementia.
METHODS: Data from 307 cognitively normal (CN) volunteer participants and those with amyloid-positive EOAD or amyloid-negative cognitive impairment (EOnonAD) were compared. Cognitive trajectories across a comprehensive cognitive battery spanning 42 months were examined using mixed-effects modeling.
RESULTS: The EOAD group displayed worse cognition at baseline relative to EOnonAD and CN groups, and more aggressive declines in cognition over time. The largest effects were observed on measures of executive functioning domains, while memory declines were blunted in EOAD.
DISCUSSION: EOAD declined 2-4× faster than EOnonAD, and EOAD pathology is not restricted to memory networks. Early identification of deficits is critical to ensure that individuals with sporadic EOAD can be considered for treatment using disease-modifying medications.
HIGHLIGHTS: Represents the most comprehensive longitudinal characterization of sporadic EOAD to date. The trajectory of cognitive declines was steep for EOAD participants and worse than for other groups. Executive functioning measures exhibited the greatest declines over time in EOAD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

40000573,Methods to crosswalk between cognitive test scores using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies use multiple different instruments to measure dementia-related outcomes, making head-to-head comparisons of interventions difficult.
METHODS: To address this gap, we developed two methods to crosswalk estimated treatment effects on cognitive outcomes that are flexible, broadly applicable, and do not rely on strong distributional assumptions.
RESULTS: We present two methods to crosswalk effect estimates using one measure to estimates using another measure, illustrated with global cognitive measures from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we develop crosswalks for the following measures and associated change scores over time: the clinical dementia rating scale sum of box (CDR-SB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Finally, a setting in which crosswalking is not appropriate is illustrated with plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentration and global cognitive measures.
DISCUSSION: Given the inconsistent collection and reporting of dementia and cognitive outcomes across studies, these crosswalking methods offer a valuable approach to harmonizing and comparing results reported on different scales.
HIGHLIGHTS: Developed methods to crosswalk from one cognitive outcome to another in studies of dementia interventions. Methods illustrated using combinations of global cognitive tests: the CDR-SB, MoCA, and MMSE. Illustrates scenarios where crosswalking may not be appropriate for certain combinations of measures. Crosswalking methods support comparison of interventions with accurate error propagation. Facilitates inclusion of more studies in meta-analyses by increasing data comparability.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39748854,Site-level factors affecting nursing home implementation of a personalized music intervention: Qualitative analyses from Music & Memory: A Pragmatic Trial for Nursing Home Residents with Alzheimer's Disease (METRIcAL).,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are preferred alternatives to using antipsychotic medications to manage disruptive behaviors in nursing home (NH) residents living with dementia. However, the implementation of these interventions is often complex in the NH environment. In this qualitative analysis of data from an embedded pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT) of a personalized music intervention, we describe NH-level implementation barriers and facilitators.
METHODS: In a 54-facility trial, we randomized 27 NHs from four US corporations to the personalized music intervention. In this qualitative analysis, we analyzed barriers and facilitators at 9 of the 27 intervention NHs, using (1) routinely collected data collector observations and (2) semi-structured interviews with NH staff. We iteratively developed codes to best describe these data and generated themes.
RESULTS: We found five qualitative themes related to the variation of intervention implementation across NHs: (1) turnover and institutional changes interfered with implementation; (2) consistent with pragmatic implementation, delivery strategies varied across NHs; (3) family members influenced residents' participation; (4) non-clinical program champions needed clinical buy-in, which was challenging and required demonstrating the intervention's clinical benefits; and (5) technological barriers among staff and residents impeded implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative results from nine facilities participating in a NH ePCT of personalized music intervention highlight the importance of identifying an intervention's key components to ensure fidelity, while allowing the flexibility necessary for pragmatic implementation. Engaging family caregivers may improve the implementation of NPIs in the NH setting. Results may be helpful to other researchers implementing NPIs to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms for people living with dementia in NHs.
HIGHLIGHTS: This was a real-world trial of a personalized music for nursing home (NH) residents with dementia.Pragmatic adaptations to intervention delivery may have compromised fidelity.Family caregivers are important to the success of behavioral interventions in NHs.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39807654,Clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 in identifying abnormal brain amyloid burden in an Asian cohort with high prevalence of concomitant cerebrovascular disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Using an Asian cohort with high prevalence of concomitant cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), we evaluated the performance of a plasma immunoassay for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) in detecting amyloid beta positivity (Aβ+) on positron emission tomography and cognitive decline, based on a three-range reference, which stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for Aβ+.
METHODS: Brain amyloid status (Aβ- [n = 142] vs Aβ+ [n = 73]) on amyloid PET scans was assessed along with the plasma ALZpath p-tau217 assay to derive three-range reference points for PET Aβ+ based on 90% sensitivity (lower threshold) and 90% specificity (upper threshold).
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.923) outperformed routine clinical assessments (AUC = 0.760-0.819; p ≤ 0.003) and other plasma biomarkers (AUC = 0.817-0.834; p < 0.001). The high-risk group showed significantly higher rates of cognitive decline than the low-risk group.
DISCUSSION: Risk stratification for PET Aβ+ based on a plasma p-tau217 assay demonstrated potential diagnostic and prognostic utility in an Asian cohort with concomitant CeVD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The utility of plasma p-tau217 to detect brain amyloid beta pathology (Aβ+) was studied in an Asian cohort with concomitant cerebrovascular disease Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) showed superior utility in detecting Aβ+ compared to neuroimaging measures, clinical workup, or other blood biomarkers including p-tau181, glial fibrillary protein (GFAP), and Aβ Higher plasma p-tau217 correlated with faster cognitive decline Plasma p-tau217 shows promise as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in diverse populations.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39996033,Plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency as a potential predictor for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia: Findings from the GMCII cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the association between plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ) and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and determine its predictive value for outcomes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Plasma from 727 subjects (286 AD, 260 MCI, and 181 controls) in a case registry was analyzed using the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma OAβ.
RESULTS: Elevated plasma OAβ was strongly correlated with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD. Patients with MCI with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrated a higher risk of progressing to dementia (hazard ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.137). Baseline plasma OAβ effectively predicted MCI-dementia conversion (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.824, 95% CI 0.752-0.897).
DISCUSSION: The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma OAβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: We recruit study participants of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal controls in a case registry.We use the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ).We observe that elevated plasma OAβ strongly correlates with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD.MCI individuals with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrate a higher risk of progressing to dementia.The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma Oaβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from MCI to dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40116640,Association of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers with low premorbid intellectual functioning in a multi-ethnic community-dwelling cohort: A cross-sectional study of HABS-HD.,"Background: Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) may have a five-fold increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies investigating brain aging among individuals with ID without Down syndrome (DS) are lacking. To begin addressing this gap, our study utilized word reading, a widely recognized indicator of an individual's premorbid intellectual ability (pIQ), to examine the effects of ID without DS on plasma AD biomarker outcomes. Objective: To investigate the relationship between premorbid intellectual ability (pIQ) and plasma AD biomarkers in individuals with ID without DS, while considering ethnic differences in these associations. Methods: Participants from the Health &amp; Aging Brain Study - Health Disparities (HABS-HD) were categorized into low (z ≤ -2.00) or average (z = 0.00 ± 1.00) pIQ groups based on word reading scores. Plasma biomarkers including Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-Tau181), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and total tau (t-tau) were assayed using Simoa technology. Results: Individuals with low pIQ exhibited significantly higher levels of p-Tau181 (p &lt; 0.05), NfL (p &lt; 0.05), and t-tau (p &lt; 0.05) compared to those with average pIQ. Stratified analysis by ethnicity revealed differential associations, with Hispanic and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants showing distinct biomarker profiles relative to non-Hispanic Black (NHB) individuals. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that low pIQ is a reliable factor associated with plasma AD biomarker outcomes. Ethnicity appears to modulate these associations, suggesting complex interactions between factors driving AD susceptibility across diverse populations. This study highlights the importance of considering both pIQ and ethnicity in neurodegenerative processes, particularly in individuals with non-DS intellectual developmental disability.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39807642,Cognitive aging outcomes are related to both tau pathology and maintenance of cingulate cortex structure.,"INTRODUCTION: Successful cognitive aging is related to both maintaining brain structure and avoiding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but how these factors interplay is unclear.
METHODS: A total of 109 cognitively normal older adults (70+ years old) underwent amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive testing. Cognitive aging was quantified using the cognitive age gap (CAG), subtracting chronological age from predicted cognitive age.
RESULTS: Lower CAG (younger cognitive age) was related to slower decline in episodic memory, multi-domain cognition, and atrophy of the midcingulate cortex (MCC). Lower entorhinal cortical tau was linked to slower decline in episodic memory, multi-domain cognition, and hippocampal atrophy.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that aging outcomes may be influenced by two independent pathways: one associated with tau accumulation, affecting primarily memory and hippocampal atrophy, and another involving tau-independent structural preservation of the MCC, benefiting multi-domain cognition over time.
HIGHLIGHTS: Younger cognitive age (lower cognitive age gap [CAG]) is related to slower cognitive decline. Lower CAG is linked to slower midcingulate cortex (MCC) atrophy. Reduced tau in the entorhinal cortex is related to less hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline. Structural preservation of the MCC benefits multi-domain cognition over time. Two independent pathways influence cognitive aging: tau accumulation and MCC preservation.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40046340,Association between amyloid-β42 levels and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease trials.,"Research on how Alzheimer's disease drugs impact neuropsychiatric symptoms is limited. Given the link between changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) levels and cognitive and clinical outcomes after anti-Aβ treatments, we hypothesized a similar association exists with neuropsychiatric symptoms. We conducted a meta-analysis of anti-Aβ drugs clinical trials to evaluate whether the changes in cerebrospinal Aβ42 levels are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and if any such effect is mediated by changes in cognitive performance, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data from 10 trials involving 10 746 Alzheimer's disease patients were included. Decreases in Aβ42 levels were associated with worsening Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores (regression coefficient: -0.68; 95% confidence interval: -1.07 to -0.29; P = 0.002), and this association persisted after adjusting for Mini-Mental State Examination. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. Changes in CSF Aβ42 levels are inversely and independently associated with the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in anti-Aβ trials, suggesting a potential role of Aβ42 in modulating neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun,2025
40145325,Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Loss-of-function variants of the ABCA7 gene are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). How neuronal ABCA7 contributes to AD pathogenesis is unknown.
METHODS: Using neuron-specific Abca7 KO mice (nAbca7<sup>-/-</sup>) with or without 5×FAD amyloid model background and post mortem AD brains, we investigated AD-related phenotypes through comprehensive approaches including transcriptomics and lipidomics.
RESULTS: Lipidomics analysis detected altered lipid profiles in the brains and synaptosomes of 5×FAD; nAbca7<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to controls. Transcriptomics profiling revealed that neuronal ABCA7 deficiency altered the expression of genes and pathways related to mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis, particularly in excitatory neurons. Consistently, synaptosomes isolated from 5×FAD; nAbca7<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed diminished mitochondria respiration and reduced synaptic protein levels, which is further supported by results from human AD brains.
DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal that neuronal ABCA7 plays a critical role in mitochondrial homeostasis important for neuronal function and survival in the presence of AD pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency exacerbates Aβ pathology and neuronal damage in 5×FAD mice. Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency alters brain transcriptomes and lipidomes of 5×FAD mice. Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency disturbs mitochondria functions in synaptosomes from 5×FAD mice.

39766387,The Association Between Traumatic Brain Injury and the Risk of Cognitive Decline: An Umbrella Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There is currently increasing interest in the implication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a potential risk factor for long-term neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between TBI and the risk of dementia.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant meta-analyses and cohort studies. Studies were included if they reported effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] or relative risks [RRs]) for the association between TBI, its severity, and the risk of dementia or AD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that TBI significantly increases the risk of dementia, with an overall odds ratio of 1.81 (95% CI: 1.53-2.14). Mild TBI was associated with a modest increase in dementia risk (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.70-2.26), while moderate-to-severe TBI showed a stronger association (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.55-2.45). In contrast, the association between TBI and AD was less consistent, with the pooled OR for AD being 1.18 (at 95% CI: 1.11-1.25) for mild TBI; however, in several studies, no significant association was observed (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.91-1.15). The results also indicated substantial heterogeneity across studies, particularly in relation to AD outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this umbrella meta-analysis confirm that TBI is a significant risk factor for dementia, with more severe TBIs conferring a higher risk. While mild TBIs also increase the risk of dementia, the effect is more pronounced in moderate-to-severe injuries. The evidence linking TBI to AD is less robust, with inconsistent findings across studies. Clinicians should consider long-term cognitive screening and management for individuals with a history of TBI, particularly those with moderate-to-severe injuries.",Brain Sci,2024
39834250,"SGLT2 inhibition, circulating biomarkers, and Alzheimer's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is a novel category of medications for diabetes, exhibiting neuroprotective potential. However, evidence regarding whether the use of SGLT2 inhibitors effectively reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Our study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate potential causal relationships between SGLT2 inhibition, metabolites, and AD.
METHODS: In our research, we used a two-sample MR method to explore the link between SGLT2 inhibitor use and AD, addressing both its late-onset and early-onset forms. Furthermore, we executed a two-step MR analysis to explore how circulating metabolites, primarily endogenous in nature due to SGLT2 inhibition, mediate the relationship between SGLT2 inhibition and AD. The genetic instruments for SGLT2 inhibition were pinpointed through their association with SLC5A2 gene expression and the decreased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.
RESULTS: Genetic analysis indicated that SGLT2 inhibition, which effectively reduces HbA1c by enhancing renal glucose excretion and improving glycemic control, was associated with a lower likelihood of developing AD for every 1 SD decrease in HbA1c (OR = 0.48, [0.36, 0.63], p < 0.001). Our MR analysis revealed that SGLT2 inhibition significantly affected 27 of the 123 metabolites examined, adhering to a Bonferroni correction threshold (p < 4.06 × 10-4). Among these 27 significant metabolites, citrate was also associated with AD, showing a significant association (0.81 [0.79, 0.83], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides strong evidence linking SGLT2 inhibition with a lower AD risk, highlighting citrate's potential mediating role for subsequent clinical research.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39907189,Differential roles of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in stepwise biomarker-guided diagnostics.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the differential roles of various plasma biomarkers in a stepwise diagnostic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A total of 2984 participants, including 666 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 2032 with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS), and 286 non-ACS individuals, were recruited. Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, four phosphorylated tau (p-tau) epitopes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured using immunoassays.
RESULTS: NfL demonstrated fair to excellent accuracy in differentiating non-ACS from CU groups (area under the curve [AUC], 0.79 to 0.94). p-tau217 had the highest accuracy for identifying Aβ (AUC 0.94) and tau positron emission tomography status (AUC 0.91). In the ACS group, p-tau217 was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline (p < .001).
DISCUSSION: NfL may serve as a useful screening tool, while p-tau217 is particularly valuable for confirming AD pathology and prognosis.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma NfL could screen for cognitive impairment. p-tau217 reliably detects AD pathology, regardless of diagnosis. p-tau217 and GFAP predict prognosis in ACS. Each plasma biomarker plays a distinct role in stepwise AD diagnostics.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39917247,Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations during music-evoked autobiographical memories in neurotypical older adults.,"INTRODUCTION: Researchers have shown that music-evoked autobiographical memories (MEAMs) can stimulate long-term memory mechanisms while requiring little retrieval effort and may therefore be used in promising non-pharmacological interventions to mitigate memory deficits. Despite an increasing number of studies on MEAMs, few researchers have explored how MEAMs are bound in the brain.
METHODS: In the current study activation indexed by fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) during familiar and unfamiliar MEAM retrieval was compared in a sample of 24 healthy older adults. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the impact of age-related gray matter volume (GMV) reduction in key regions associated with MEAM-related activation. In addition to a T1 structural scan, neuroimaging data were collected while participants listened to familiar music (MEAM retrieval) versus unfamiliar music.
RESULTS: When listening to familiar compared to unfamiliar music, greater fALFF activation patterns were observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus, controlling for age and GMV. The current findings for the familiar (MEAM) condition have implications for cognitive aging as persons experiencing age-related memory decline are particularly susceptible to volumetric reduction in the parahippocampal cortex. Post-hoc analyses to explore correlations between brain activity and the content of MEAMs were performed using the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that MEAM-related activation of the parahippocampal cortex is evident in normative older adults. However, it is yet to be determined whether such brain states are attainable in older adult populations diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and/or prodromal Alzheimer's disease.",Front Neurosci,2024
39860585,Early Spatio-Temporal and Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background/Objectives: Mental representation of spatial information relies on egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (environment-based) frames of reference. Research showed that spatial memory deteriorates as Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses and that allocentric spatial memory is among the earliest impaired areas. Most studies have been conducted in static situations despite the dynamic nature of real-world spatial processing. Thus, this raises the question: Does temporal order affect spatial memory? The present study, by adopting a dynamic spatial memory task, explored how the temporal order of item presentation influences egocentric and allocentric spatial judgments in individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (eAD) and healthy elderly individuals (normal controls-NC). Method: Participants were required to memorize dyads of simple 3D geometrical objects presented one at a time on a desk along with a bar. Afterwards, they had to choose what stimulus appeared either closest to them (egocentric judgment) or closest to the bar (allocentric judgment). Results: Results revealed that the temporal order significantly affected spatial judgments in eAD patients but not in NC participants. While eAD patients remain anchored to the item presented first, which is more accurate regardless of the frame used, NC are equally accurate with the item that appears first or second. This is presumably because eAD patients struggle to flexibly shift attention and update spatial representations in dynamic situations, which leads to reliance on initial information and difficulties with information presented later. Conclusions: This highlights the importance of further understanding the cognitive strategies employed by AD patients.",J Clin Med,2025

39762274,"Mortality causes and health spending by gender and health conditions in octogenarians, nonagenarians and centenarians in Colombia.","This document determines the causes of mortality (2008-2022) and calculate per capita health expenditure (2013-2021) in octogenarians, nonagenarians and centenarians in the Colombian population, considering year, gender and age group. For this nationwide retrospective descriptive observational study, epidemiological regions, urban/rural areas and morbidities were also studied. A mean of 75,552 deaths was observed from 2008 to 2022. Deaths were higher due to ischemic heart disease, COVID-19, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular diseases in the oldest old Colombian population with urban areas having higher mortality rates than rural areas (an average of 948 (min: 847, max: 1207) against 630 (min: 558, max: 789) per 10,000 people, respectively). Conditions of cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, influenza pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most expensive in health care, summing above 5000 purchasing power parity USD on average (min: 2234, max: 7539). These conditions, along with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, were the most frequently recorded. COVID-19 incurred higher health expenditure in rural areas compared to urban areas (1090 vs. 519 purchasing power parity USD respectively). High prevalence (14·3%) and medical attention (16·8 health care utilisations per capita) were shown for organic mental disorders. Our analysis found that centenarians survived COVID-19 more than octogenarians and nonagenarians, with several hypotheses attributing this to their immune profiles. We found high expenditure on HIV/AIDS among older males suggesting the need for further study on sexually transmitted diseases prevention in this population. Lastly, Alzheimer's disease, particularly in rural areas, had substantial expenditure. Therefore, neurodegenerative diseases and the impact of stressful events on mental health must be priorities for the health system to ensure adequate resource management.",Sci Rep,2025
40151911,Effect of ventricular volume on cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"BackgroundIdiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a common disorder in aging populations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant comorbidity in iNPH patients, and the presence of AD pathology is associated with worse shunting outcomes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of AD-associated biomarkers in iNPH patients are universally reduced and the exact mechanism related to this is unknown.ObjectiveOur aim was to study the effects of ventricular volume on CSF AD-associated biomarker levels in iNPH patients, to determine whether a dilution effect occurs and to assess if brain AD pathology contributes to this effect.MethodsA total of 153 iNPH patients had lumbar CSF samples available for analysis, along with brain MRIs of sufficient quality. Automated image analysis software was used to determine the volume of different brain segments. Volumes normalized for age, sex and head size were used for analysis. Brain biopsy data on AD pathology was also available.ResultsNone of the intracerebral ventricular volumes correlated with CSF levels of AD-associated biomarkers, indicating no dilution effect was present in this context. However, in iNPH patients positive for amyloid-β pathology in the biopsy, the volume of the fourth ventricle correlated inversely with all investigated biomarkers.ConclusionsIntracerebral ventricular volumes do not correlate with AD biomarker levels in CSF, arguing against a dilution effect. However, in patients with AD pathology, the volume of the fourth ventricle is inversely correlated with CSF T-Tau and P-Tau<sub>181</sub> levels, suggesting a complex relationship between brain AD pathology, CSF flow and CSF volume in iNPH patients.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39882359,Effect of acupuncture on the gait disturbance and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment and behavioral impairment. The gait of AD patients is attracting the increasing attention. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to explore the effect of acupuncture on the cognitive function, gait performance, and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortices.
METHODS: In this RCT, a total of 108 AD patients will be randomly assigned into acupuncture group or control group for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be three-dimensional gait analysis and cerebral hemodynamics using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Secondary outcomes will include Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index (BI).
DISCUSSION: This trial is expected to explore the effect of acupuncture on cognitive function, gait performance, and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortices for AD patients.",Front Neurol,2024
39987324,Identification of UBE2N as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease by combining WGCNA with machine learning algorithms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, emphasizing the critical need for the development of biomarkers that facilitate accurate and objective assessment of disease progression for early detection and intervention to delay its onset. In our study, three AD datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were integrated for differential expression analysis, followed by a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and potential AD biomarkers were screened. Our study identified UBE2N as a promising biomarker for AD. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that UBE2N is associated with synaptic vesicle cycling and T cell/B cell receptor signaling pathways. Notably, UBE2N expression levels were found to be significantly reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of the Tau<sup>P301S</sup> mice. Furthermore, analysis of single-cell data from AD patients demonstrated the association of UBE2N and T cell function. These findings underscore the potential of UBE2N as a valuable biomarker for AD, offering important insights for diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies.",Sci Rep,2025
40189841,Tauopathy after long-term cervical lymphadenectomy.,"INTRODUCTION: This study examined the effects of long-term cervical lymphadenectomy (cLE) on cognitive and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like tauopathy changes.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were used to assess cLE impacts on sleep, brain pathways, and pathologies. RNA sequencing and proteomics analyzed gene/protein changes, with results verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: CLE led to sleep and psychiatric disorders, linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation. Activation of ERK may interfere with autophagy and is associated with phosphorylated tau accumulation. Peripheral blood analysis shows decreased brain waste in the peripheral blood post-cLE, implicating impaired lymphatic drainage and brain waste build-up.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest a potential connection between cLE and AD-like tauopathy, potentially influencing surgical decisions.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cervical lymphadenectomy (cLE) is the cornerstone of head and neck cancers, affecting millions of people each year. We provide the first evidence of mildly impaired cognitive functioning with significant anxiety-depressive disorders in mice after long-term cLE. Long-term cLE not only directly impairs brain wastes (amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau [p-tau]) drainage, but also activates the Erk1/2 signaling pathway leading to attenuation of autophagy. We found for the first time that long-term cLE accelerated the deposition of p-tau in young mice. Patients after clinical cervical lymph node dissection showed reduced brain waste in peripheral blood consistent with mouse models. This study suggests the need for further evaluation of the neurologic effects of cervical lymph node dissection, a procedure that affects millions of people each year.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39787209,Patient stratification by genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease is only effective in the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity.,"Case-only designs in longitudinal cohorts are a valuable resource for identifying disease-relevant genes, pathways, and novel targets influencing disease progression. This is particularly relevant in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where longitudinal cohorts measure disease ""progression,"" defined by rate of cognitive decline. Few of the identified drug targets for AD have been clinically tractable, and phenotypic heterogeneity is an obstacle to both clinical research and basic science. In four cohorts (n = 7241), we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) to discover novel targets associated with progression and assess causal relationships. We tested opportunities for patient stratification by deriving polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD risk and severity and tested the value of these scores in predicting progression. Genome-wide association studies identified no loci associated with progression at genome-wide significance (α = 5×10-8); MR analyses provided no significant evidence of an association between cognitive decline in AD patients and protein levels in brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma. Polygenic risk scores for AD risk did not reliably stratify fast from slow progressors; however, a deeper investigation found that APOE ε4 status predicts amyloid-β and tau positive versus negative patients (odds ratio for an additional APOE ε4 allele = 5.78 [95% confidence interval: 3.76-8.89], P<0.001) when restricting to a subset of patients with available CSF biomarker data. These results provided no evidence for large-effect, common-variant loci involved in the rate of memory decline, suggesting that patient stratification based on common genetic risk factors for progression may have limited utility. Where clinically relevant biomarkers suggest diagnostic heterogeneity, there is evidence that a priori identified genetic risk factors may have value in patient stratification. Mendelian randomization was less tractable due to the lack of large-effect loci, and future analyses with increased samples sizes are needed to replicate and validate our results.",PLoS One,2025
39817194,Cognitive and Alzheimer's disease biomarker effects of oral nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation in older adults with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Age-associated depletion in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) concentrations has been implicated in metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. Supplementation with NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), offers a potential therapeutic avenue against neurodegenerative pathologies in aging, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias. A crossover, double-blind, randomized placebo (PBO) controlled trial was conducted to test the safety and efficacy of 8 weeks' active treatment with NR (1 g/day) on cognition and plasma AD biomarkers in older adults with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: The primary efficacy outcome was the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Secondary outcomes included plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau<sup>217</sup>), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Exploratory outcomes included Lumosity gameplay (z-scores) for cognition and step counts from wearables. Mixed model for repeated measures was used for between-group comparisons; paired t-tests were used for within-individual comparisons.
RESULTS: Forty-six participants aged over 55 were randomized to NR-PBO or PBO-NR groups; 41 completed baseline visits, and 37 completed the trial. NR supplementation was safe and well tolerated with no differences in adverse events reported between NR and PBO treatment phases. For the between-group comparison, there was a 7% reduction in pTau<sup>217</sup> concentrations after taking NR, while an 18% increase with PBO (p = 0.02). No significant between-group differences were observed for RBANS, other plasma biomarkers(GFAP and NfL), Lumosity gameplay scores or step counts. For the within-individual comparison, pTau<sup>217</sup> concentrations significantly decreased during the NR phase compared to the PBO (p = 0.02), while step counts significantly increased during the NR phase than PBO (p = 0.04).
DISCUSSION: Eight weeks NR supplementation is safe and lowered pTau<sup>217</sup> concentrations but did not alter cognition as measured by conventional or novel digital assessments. Further research is warranted to validate NR's efficacy in altering pathological brain aging processes.
HIGHLIGHTS: The integrated study design combines a two-arm parallel trial with a crossover phase, offering the opportunity to enhance sample size for within-individual analysis and assess carryover effects.NR is safe but did not alter cognition as measured by multi-modal assessments in SCD/MCI.For between-group comparison, pTau<sup>217</sup> levels decreased with NR and increased with PBO at 8-week follow-up.For within-individual comparison, step counts increased after NR and decreased after PBO.A larger, longer study with pharmacodynamic and pathophysiological biomarkers is needed to assess NR's disease-modifying effects.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39865315,RADAR-AD: assessment of multiple remote monitoring technologies for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and functional decline. Early detection and intervention are crucial for enhancing the quality of life of patients and their families. Remote Monitoring Technologies (RMTs) offer a promising solution for early detection by tracking changes in behavioral and cognitive functions, such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. Timely detection of these symptoms can facilitate early intervention, potentially slowing disease progression and enabling appropriate treatment and care.
METHODS: The RADAR-AD study was designed to evaluate the accuracy and validity of multiple RMTs in detecting functional decline across various stages of AD in a real-world setting, compared to standard clinical rating scales. Our approach involved a univariate analysis using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to analyze individual features of six RMTs while adjusting for variables such as age, sex, years of education, clinical site, BMI and season. Additionally, we employed four machine learning classifiers - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost - using a nested cross-validation approach to assess the discriminatory capabilities of the RMTs.
RESULTS: The ANCOVA results indicated significant differences between healthy and AD subjects regarding reduced physical activity, less REM sleep, altered gait patterns, and decreased cognitive functioning. The machine-learning-based analysis demonstrated that RMT-based models could identify subjects in the prodromal stage with an Area Under the ROC Curve of 73.0 %. In addition, our findings show that the Amsterdam iADL questionnaire has high discriminatory abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: RMTs show promise in AD detection already in the prodromal stage. Using them could allow for earlier detection and intervention, thereby improving patients' quality of life. Furthermore, the Amsterdam iADL questionnaire holds high potential when employed remotely.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39766385,rTMS Modulation of Behavioral and Biological Measures in 3xTg-AD Mice.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The biological basis for behavioral manifestations of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Emotional and behavioral alterations of Alzheimer's disease can result in substantial caregiver burden and lack effective management. This study expands upon previous work investigating behavioral alterations in mice with Alzheimer's disease and a potential treatment of increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
METHODS: A total of 47 3xTg-AD (Alzheimer's) and 53 B6 (wildtype) mice were administered ANA12 (an antagonist of TrkB receptor) or Vehicle (saline) and then rTMS or Sham treatment daily. After 14 days of treatments and injections, mouse behavior was assessed under various behavioral cognitive tests. Mice were then perfused, and brain samples were processed for histology and protein assays. Brain homogenates were analyzed for BDNF and its downstream signaling molecules.
RESULTS: Open field testing demonstrated that 3xTg-AD mice spent more time in the center than B6 mice. 3xTg-AD-Sham mice injected with ANA12 were the only group to travel significantly less distance than B6-ANA12-Sham or B6-Vehicle-Sham mice (p &lt; 0.05), while 3xTg-AD-rTMS mice (irrespective of injection) were not significantly different from B6 mice. 3xTg-AD mice had significantly greater measured levels of BDNF and TrkB than the wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Alzheimer's disease using rTMS positively affects elements of hypoactivity, but not all behavioral abnormalities. rTMS shifted 3xTg-AD open field behavioral test measures, generating significant differences between untreated 3xTg-AD and B6 genotypes. Despite its benefit, further investigation of rTMS as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease as well as its biological underpinnings are needed.",Brain Sci,2024
39748842,The HOPE4MCI study: AGB101 treatment slows progression of entorhinal cortex atrophy in APOE ε4 non-carriers with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal hyperactivity is a hallmark of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) that predicts progression in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). AGB101 is an extended-release formulation of levetiracetam in the dose range previously demonstrated to normalize hippocampal activity and improve cognitive performance in aMCI. The HOPE4MCI study was a 78-week trial to assess the progression of MCI due to AD. As reported in Mohs et al., the decline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB) was reduced by 40% in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 non-carriers over the 78-week duration of the study with a negligible effect in carriers. Here we report an exploratory analysis of the effects of AGB101 on neuroimaging and biomarker measures in the 44 APOE ε4 non-carriers who completed the 78-week protocol.
METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at baseline and after 78 weeks were analyzed using the Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields software providing volume measures of key structures of the medial temporal lobe relevant to AD progression. Blood samples collected at 78 weeks in the study were analyzed for plasma biomarkers.
RESULTS: Treatment with AGB101 significantly reduced atrophy of the left entorhinal cortex (ERC) compared to placebo. This reduction in atrophy was correlated with less decline in the CDR-SB score over 78 weeks and with lower neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration.
DISCUSSION: The HOPE4MCI study showed that APOE ε4 non-carriers treated with AGB101 demonstrated a substantially more favorable treatment effect compared to carriers. Here we report that treatment with AGB101 in non-carriers of APOE ε4 significantly reduced atrophy of the left ERC over 78 weeks. That reduction in atrophy was closely coupled with the change in CDR-SB and with plasma NfL indicative of neurodegeneration in the brain. These exploratory analyses are consistent with a reduction in neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 non-carriers treated with AGB101 before a clinical diagnosis of dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: AGB101 slows entorhinal cortex (ERC) atrophy in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 non-carriers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with less Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes decline.Slowing ERC atrophy by AGB101 is associated with lower neurofilament light chain.AGB101 treatment reduces neurodegeneration in APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI due to AD.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40069774,A versatile mouse model to advance human microglia transplantation research in neurodegenerative diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies highlight the critical role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders, and emphasize the need for humanized models to accurately study microglial responses. Human-mouse microglia xenotransplantation models are a valuable platform for functional studies and for testing therapeutic approaches, yet currently those models are only available for academic research. This hampers their implementation for the development and testing of medication that targets human microglia.
METHODS: We developed the hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> mouse line, which is suitable as a new transplantation model and available to be crossed to any disease model of interest. The hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> model created by CRISPR gene editing is RAG2 deficient and expresses human CSF1. Additionally, we crossed this model with two humanized App KI mice, the App<sup>Hu</sup> and the App<sup>SAA</sup>. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and bulk sequencing was used to study the response of microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate the successful transplantation of iPSC-derived human microglia into the brains of hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> mice without triggering a NK-driven immune response. Furthermore, we confirmed the multipronged response of microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> and the crosses with the Alzheimer's disease knock-in model App<sup>SAA</sup> and the humanized App knock-in control mice, App<sup>Hu</sup> are deposited with EMMA and fully accessible to the research community.
CONCLUSION: The hCSF1<sup>Bdes</sup> mouse is available for both non-profit and for-profit organisations, facilitating the use of the xenotransplantation paradigm for human microglia to study complex human disease.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39737743,Guidelines for the standardization of pre-analytical variables for salivary biomarker studies in Alzheimer's disease research: An updated review and consensus of the Salivary Biomarkers for Dementia Research Working Group.,"There is a pressing need for accessible biomarkers with high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis to facilitate widespread screening, particularly in underserved groups. Saliva is an emerging specimen for measuring AD biomarkers, with distinct contexts of use that could complement blood and cerebrospinal fluid and detect various analytes. An interdisciplinary, international group of AD and related dementias (ADRD) researchers convened and performed a narrative review of published studies on salivary AD biomarkers. We critically appraised the current state of the literature, examining both consistencies and discrepancies in existing pre-analytical variables and methodologies. We discussed how various pre-analytical variables could influence the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers, showed technologies available to standardize collection procedures, and proposed a standardized pre-analytical protocol to guide future studies on salivary AD biomarker examinations. We identified potential contexts of use, gaps, and priorities and proposed future research directions. HIGHLIGHTS: Given its non-invasive nature, wider accessibility, and cultural acceptability, particularly in low-resourced settings, saliva is a biofluid complementary to blood and CSF. Current salivary AD biomarker studies do not control for many confounding pre-analytical variables during the sampling process, potentially leading to inaccurate salivary biomarker readings and conclusions, contributing to conflicting findings. Reviewing the current literature, including the consistencies and non-consistencies observed in the existing parameters and methodologies, discussing how they can affect salivary AD biomarker detection and quantification.

39831085,Pharmacological enhancement of slow-wave activity at an early disease stage improves cognition and reduces amyloid pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Improving sleep in murine Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with reduced brain amyloidosis. However, the window of opportunity for successful sleep-targeted interventions, regarding the reduction in pathological hallmarks and related cognitive performance, remains poorly characterized.
METHODS: Here, we enhanced slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep via sodium oxybate (SO) oral administration for 2 weeks at early (6 months old) or moderately late (11 months old) disease stages in Tg2576 mice and evaluated resulting neuropathology and behavioral performance.
RESULTS: We observed that the cognitive performance of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice significantly improved upon SO treatment, whereas no change was observed in 11-month-old mice. Histochemical assessment of amyloid plaques demonstrated that SO-treated 11-month-old Tg2576 mice had significantly less plaque burden than placebo-treated ones, whereas ELISA of insoluble protein fractions from brains of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice indicated lower Aβ-42/Aβ-40 ratio in SO-treated group vs. placebo-treated controls.
DISCUSSION: Altogether, our results suggest that SWA-dependent reduction in brain amyloidosis leads to alleviated behavioral impairment in Tg2576 mice only if administered early in the disease course, potentially highlighting the key importance of early sleep-based interventions in clinical cohorts.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39779842,Heritable polygenic editing: the next frontier in genomic medicine?,"Polygenic genome editing in human embryos and germ cells is predicted to become feasible in the next three decades. Several recent books and academic papers have outlined the ethical concerns raised by germline genome editing and the opportunities that it may present<sup>1-3</sup>. To date, no attempts have been made to predict the consequences of altering specific variants associated with polygenic diseases. In this Analysis, we show that polygenic genome editing could theoretically yield extreme reductions in disease susceptibility. For example, editing a relatively small number of genomic variants could make a substantial difference to an individual's risk of developing coronary artery disease, Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and schizophrenia. Similarly, large changes in risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, could, in theory, be achieved by polygenic editing. Although heritable polygenic editing (HPE) is still speculative, we completed calculations to discuss the underlying ethical issues. Our modelling demonstrates how the putatively positive consequences of gene editing at an individual level may deepen health inequalities. Further, as single or multiple gene variants can increase the risk of some diseases while decreasing that of others, HPE raises ethical challenges related to pleiotropy and genetic diversity. We conclude by arguing for a collectivist perspective on the ethical issues raised by HPE, which accounts for its effects on individuals, their families, communities and society<sup>4</sup>.",Nature,2025

Concurrently, we assessed the concentration of proteins associated with AD and neuroinflammation in the plasma of the same subjects.ResultsWe found that the abundance of proinflammatory CXCR3 <sup>+</sup> CD127<sup>+</sup> Type 1 T helper (Th1) cells in AD patients was negatively correlated with the abundance of neurofilament light chain protein. This correlation is apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4-dependent.

Moreover, the proinflammatory capacity of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD127<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells in the CSF of AD patients was further increased compared to HCs.ConclusionsThese results reveal an association of a peripheral T-cell change with neuroinflammation in AD and suggest that dysregulation of peripheral adaptive immune responses, particularly involving CXCR3 <sup>+</sup> CD127<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, may potentially be mediated by factors such as ApoE ε4 genotype.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39696300,"The double life of glucose metabolism: brain health, glycemic homeostasis, and your patients with type 2 diabetes.","The maintenance of cognitive function is essential for quality of life and health outcomes in later years. Cognitive impairment, however, remains an undervalued long-term complication of type 2 diabetes by patients and providers alike. The burden of sustained hyperglycemia includes not only cognitive deficits but also the onset and progression of dementia-related conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent research has shown that the brain maintains an independent glucose ""microsystem""-evolved to ensure the availability of fuel for brain neurons without interruption by transient hypoglycemia. When this milieu is perturbed, brain hyperglycemia, brain glucotoxicity, and brain insulin resistance can ensue and interfere with insulin signaling, a key pathway to cognitive function and neuronal integrity. This newly understood brain homeostatic system operates semi-autonomously from the systemic glucoregulatory apparatus. Large-scale clinical studies have shown that systemic dysglycemia is also strongly associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, which can be mitigated through appropriate clinical management of plasma glucose levels. Moreover, these studies demonstrated that glucose-lowering agents are not equally effective at preventing cognitive dysfunction. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor analogs and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) appear to afford the greatest protection; metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) also significantly improved cognitive outcomes. Sulfonylureas (SUs) and exogenous insulin, on the other hand, do not provide the same protection and may actually worsen cognitive outcomes. In the creation of a treatment plan, comorbid cognitive conditions should be considered. These efficacious treatments create a new gold standard of managing hyperglycemia-one which is consistent with the ""complication-centric prescribing"" mandates issued in type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines. The increasing longevity enjoyed by our populace places the onus on clinical care to play the ""long game"" in using targeted treatments for glucose control in patients with, or at risk for, cognitive decline to maintain cognitive wellness later in life. This article reviews critical emerging data for scientists and trialists and translates new enhancements in patient care for practitioners.",BMC Med,2024
40179226,Association of cerebrospinal fluid ciliary neurotrophic factor levels with cognitive decline and disease progression.,"BackgroundCiliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been identified as a neuroprotective cytokine that can alleviate cognitive impairment in preclinical studies, although the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CNTF levels with cognitive decline and disease progression in living humans remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the association between baseline CSF CNTF levels and the rate of cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) older people respectively.MethodsA total of 667 participants were included in the study, comprising 161 CU and 506 CI individuals, with an average follow-up time of 3.97 years (SD = 2.99). Linear mixed-effects models were fitted with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as the primary outcome. As sensitivity analyses, we used another three commonly used cognitive measures as secondary outcomes to test the robustness of our findings. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subgroup to investigate the association between baseline CSF CNTF levels and the progression from MCI to dementia.ResultsWe observed that higher baseline CSF CNTF levels were linked with a slower rate of cognitive decline in the CI group, while this association was absent in the CU group. These findings were consistent across different cognitive measures. Among MCI participants, higher levels of CSF CNTF were associated with a slower rate of disease progression to dementia.ConclusionsThe association between CSF CNTF levels and both cognitive decline and disease progression highlights the potential of CNTF as a therapeutic target in the context of Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive disorders.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39868491,A multi-cohort study of longitudinal and cross-sectional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired older adults.,"INTRODUCTION: The generalizability of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in their sensitivity to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and power to predict progression in large, multisite cohorts remains unclear.
METHOD: Longitudinal demographics, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive scores of 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults (amyloid beta [Aβ]-negative/positive [A-/A+]: 1270/1558) were included. Cross-sectional and longitudinal cognition and medial temporal lobe (MTL) structural measures were extracted. Cross-sectional MTL tau burden (T) was computed from tau positron emission tomography (N = 1095).
RESULTS: We found cross-sectional tau and longitudinal structural biomarkers best separated A+ CU from A- CU. A-T+ CU had significantly faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU. MTL tau was significantly correlated with MRI and cognitive biomarkers regardless of Aβ status. MTL tau, MRI, and cognition provided complementary information about disease progression.
DISCUSSION: This large multisite study replicates prior findings in CU older adults, supporting the utility of neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in preclinical AD clinical trials and normal aging studies.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers in 3036 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau and longitudinal MTL atrophy best separate amyloid beta positive (A+) CU from amyloid beta negative (A-) CU. A- tau positive (T+) CU had a significantly faster neurodegeneration rate compared to A-T- CU.

Combined baseline MTL tau, MRI, and cognition best predict Alzheimer's disease progression.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40078868,Could immunotherapy and regulatory T cells be used therapeutically to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments are a growing problem in the healthcare world with the ageing population. There are currently no effective treatments available; however, it has been suggested that targeting neuroinflammation may be a successful approach in slowing the progression of neurodegeneration. Reducing the destructive hyperinflammatory pathology to maintain homeostasis in neural tissue is a promising option to consider. This review explores the mechanisms behind neuroinflammation and the effectiveness of immunotherapy in slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The key components of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease researched are microglia, astrocytes, cytokines and CD8+ effector T cells. The role of oxidative stress on modulating regulatory T cells and some of the limitations of regulatory T cell-based therapies are also explored. Increasing regulatory T cells can decrease activation of microglia, proinflammatory cytokines and astrocytes; however, it can also increase levels of inflammatory cytokines. There is a complex network of regulatory T cell interactions that reduce Alzheimer's disease pathology, which is not fully understood. Exploring the current literature, further research into the use of immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease is vital to determine the potential of these techniques; however, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that increasing regulatory T cells count does prevent Alzheimer's disease symptoms and pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Some exciting innovative therapies are muted to explore in the future. The function of regulatory T cells in the presence of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress should be investigated further in patients with neurogenerative disorders to ascertain if combination therapies could reduce oxidative stress while also enhancing regulatory T cells function. Could methods of immunotherapy infuse exogenous functional Tregs or enhance the immune environment in favour of endogenous regulatory T cells differentiation, thus reducing neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative pathology, inhibiting the progression of Alzheimer's disease?",Brain Commun,2025
39939930,Identifying pathways to the prevention of dementia: the Netherlands consortium of dementia cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: Aggregation of cohort data increases precision for studying neurodegenerative disease pathways, but efforts to combine data and expertise are often hampered by infrastructural, ethical and legal considerations. We aimed to unite various cohort studies in the Netherlands to enhance research infrastructure and facilitate research on dementia etiology and its public health implications.
METHODS: The Netherlands Consortium of Dementia Cohorts (NCDC) includes participants with initially no established cognitive impairment from 9 Dutch cohorts: the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC), Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS), European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD), Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS), The Maastricht Study, the Memolife substudy of the Lifelines cohort, Rotterdam Study and Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART-MR) study. The objectives of NCDC are to improve data infrastructure and access to cohorts related to aging and dementia, investigate the role of Alzheimer's disease and vascular pathology in the development of dementia and estimate the public health impact of established dementia risk factors by assessing their relative contribution to the population burden of dementia.
RESULTS: We increased the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) status of the cohorts through harmonization of data across cohorts, implementation of medical imaging repositories for scan management, implementation of the Personal Health Train infrastructure and provision of meta-data in existing cohort catalogues. We established the ethical and legal frameworks required for federated and pooled analyses and performed the first remote federated data analyses using the Personal Health Train infrastructure. To determine biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, 2554 plasma samples were analyzed centrally. Federated, pooled, and coordinated meta-analyses have led to multiple publications in the context of NCDC.
CONCLUSION: The combination of population-based and clinical cohorts, the coordinated assessment of plasma markers in previously collected samples and implementation and use of the Personal Health Train infrastructure for federated analysis are both feasible and promising for future collaborative efforts.",BMC Neurol,2025
40090555,Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography does not improve EEG Alzheimer's disease assessment.,"Quantitative EEG has been shown to reflect neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may provide non-invasive and widely available biomarkers to enhance the objectivization of disease assessment. To address EEG's major drawback - its low spatial resolution - many studies have employed 3D source localization. However, none have investigated whether this complex mapping into 3D space actually adds value over standard surface derivation. In fact, we found no prior study - in any disease - that quantitatively compared the results of a 3D source localization method with those achieved by surface derivation. We analyzed data from one of the largest prospective AD EEG studies ever conducted (four study centers, 188 patients, 100 female). Thousands of distinct quantitative EEG markers of slowing, complexity, and functional connectivity were computed and regressed against disease severity, with rigorous control for multiple testing. We found highly significant associations between quantitative EEG markers and disease severity. However, standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), a widely used 3D source localization method, did not improve results. Furthermore, a surface derivation marker (auto-mutual information of the left hemisphere during the eyes-closed condition) was the best performing marker across our entire sample. While our findings strongly support that quantitative EEG markers reflect neurodegenerative processes in AD, they do not demonstrate additional benefit from sLORETA. Importantly, our results are specific to AD and sLORETA. Therefore, they should not be generalized to other neurological or psychiatric disorders or to other 3D source localization methods without further validation. Finally, these findings do not diminish the value of 3D source localization for visual EEG inspection.",Neuroimage,2025
39886325,"Clinical and neuropathological associations of plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>, p-tau217 and neurofilament light in sporadic frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders.","INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta<sub>42</sub>/amyloid beta<sub>40</sub> (Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>) and phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) identify individuals with primary Alzheimer's disease (AD). They may detect AD co-pathology in the setting of other primary neurodegenerative diseases, but this has not been systematically studied.
METHODS: We compared the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological associations of plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> (mass spectrometry), p-tau217 (electrochemiluminescence), and neurofilament light ([NfL], single molecule array [Simoa]), as markers of AD co-pathology, in a sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cohort (n = 620).
RESULTS: Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> showed no clinicopathological associations. High p-tau217 was present in amnestic dementia (AmD) presumed to be due to FTD, logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and APOEε4 carriers, and correlated with worse baseline and longitudinal clinical scores, lower hippocampal volumes, and more severe AD co-pathology (Braak Stage). NfL was elevated in all FTD phenotypes, and correlated with clinical scores and frontotemporal brain volumes.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 has clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological correlates in sporadic FTD and may identify FTD cases with AD co-pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) features could be identified with plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).Plasma p-tau217 is a better discriminator of AD co-pathology and AD-associated features in FTLD than plasma amyloid beta<sub>42</sub>/amyloid beta<sub>40</sub> (Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>) and neurofilament light (NfL).In FTLD, plasma p-tau217, but not Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> or neurofilament light, has phenotypical, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging correlates suggestive of AD co-pathology.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40014836,Effect Modifiers of the Association of Blood Pressure With Brain Amyloid and Tau Pathology.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor of Alzheimer disease (AD), but previous studies reported heterogeneous associations of late-life blood pressure (BP) with brain amyloid and tau pathologies. We investigated how the associations of BP with brain amyloid and tau vary by APOE ε4 carriership, age, cerebrovascular burden, and cognitive status.
METHODS: We performed analyses among participants with postmortem neuropathology measurements (2005-June 2022) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. The average systolic BP (SBP) of the first 3 annual visits was the primary exposure, and baseline hypertension status was the secondary exposure. Brain AD pathologies were assessed using Thal and Braak staging. Potential modifiers included APOE ε4 carriership, age, stroke history, and cognitive status. Multinomial logistic regressions with interaction terms were used to test effect modification, adjusting for age, sex, APOE ε4 carriership, education, antihypertensive medication use, and years to death.
RESULTS: Among 2,094 participants (baseline age: 75 ± 9.5 years; 51.4% women), the association of higher SBP with higher amyloid and tau burdens varied by stroke history and cognitive status while the effect modification by age or APOE ε4 carriership was less consistent. More pronounced associations of SBP with higher amyloid and tau burdens were observed in those with dementia (vs without dementia) and those with a history of stroke (vs without stroke) (All p interaction&lt;0.05). The odds ratios (ORs) per 10-mm Hg increase in SBP in the stroke vs nonstroke subgroup were 1.58 (95% CI 1.04-2.41) vs 1.14 (1.03-1.27) for amyloid and 1.54 (1.00-2.36) vs 1.04 (0.96-1.12) for tau. When comparing dementia with cognitively normal subgroups, ORs were 1.39 (1.17-1.64) vs 1.12 (0.96-1.31) for amyloid and 1.24 (1.08-1.42) vs 0.98 (0.85-1.14) for tau. Similar findings were observed for baseline hypertension status.
DISCUSSION: Preexisting cerebrovascular burden and cognitive status might interact with elevated SBP in their association with higher brain amyloid and tau, which could help identify high-risk subgroups for BP management and AD prevention. These heterogeneous association patterns need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies with in vivo AD pathology assessments.",Neurology,2025
39985487,"Machine learning prediction of tau-PET in Alzheimer's disease using plasma, MRI, and clinical data.","INTRODUCTION: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a reliable neuroimaging technique for assessing regional load of tau pathology in the brain, but its routine clinical use is limited by cost and accessibility barriers.
METHODS: We thoroughly investigated the ability of various machine learning models to predict clinically useful tau-PET composites (load and laterality index) from low-cost and non-invasive features, for example, clinical variables, plasma biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: Models including plasma biomarkers yielded the most accurate predictions of tau-PET burden (best model: R-squared = 0.66-0.69), with especially high contribution from plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217). MRI variables were the best predictors of asymmetric tau load between the two hemispheres (best model: R-squared = 0.28-0.42). The models showed high generalizability to external test cohorts with data collected at multiple sites. Through a proof-of-concept two-step classification workflow, we also demonstrated possible model translations to a clinical setting.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the promising and limiting aspects of using machine learning to predict tau-PET from scalable cost-effective variables, with findings relevant for clinical settings and future research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Accessible variables showed potential in estimating tau tangle load and distribution. Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were the best predictors of different tau-PET (positron emission tomography) composites. Machine learning models demonstrated high generalizability across AD cohorts.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40085647,Transcriptional signatures of hippocampal tau pathology in primary age-related tauopathy and Alzheimer's disease.,"In primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates share a similar structure and anatomic distribution, which is distinct from tau pathology in other diseases. However, transcriptional similarities between PART and AD and gene expression changes within tau-pathology-bearing neurons are largely unknown. Using GeoMx spatial transcriptomics, mRNA was quantified in hippocampal neurons with and without tau pathology in PART and AD. Synaptic genes were down-regulated in disease overall but up-regulated in tau-pathology-positive neurons. Two transcriptional signatures were associated with intraneuronal tau, both validated in a cortical AD dataset. Genes in the up-regulated signature were enriched in calcium regulation and synaptic function. Notably, transcriptional changes associated with intraneuronal tau in PART and AD were similar, suggesting a possible mechanistic relationship. These findings highlight the power of molecular analysis stratified by pathology and provide insight into common pathways associated with tau pathology in PART and AD.",Cell Rep,2025
40069342,A comprehensive interpretable machine learning framework for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"An interpretable machine learning (ML) framework is introduced to enhance the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by ensuring robustness of the ML models' interpretations. The dataset used comprises volumetric measurements from brain MRI and genetic data from healthy individuals and patients with MCI/AD, obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The existing class imbalance is addressed by an ensemble learning approach, while various attribution-based and counterfactual-based interpretability methods are leveraged towards producing diverse explanations related to the pathophysiology of MCI/AD. A unification method combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the interpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded 87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score. The attribution-based interpretability methods highlighted significant volumetric and genetic features related to MCI/AD risk. The unification method provided useful insights regarding those features' necessity and sufficiency, further showcasing their significance in MCI/AD diagnosis.",Sci Rep,2025
39839075,Dynamic neurocognitive adaptation in aging: Development and validation of a new scale.,"INTRODUCTION: Forty-five percent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases may have been preventable through protective factors. Reserve, resilience, and resistance share common neurocognitive adaptive processes, acting through protective mechanisms. In this article we propose the development and validation of a new scale, called dynamic Neurocognitive Adaptation, developed in this direction.
METHODS: We included 815 participants (50% women; 65+ years inclusive of age), divided into two subsamples for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Our initial scale was composed of 30 items, investigating seven dimensions, explored by a 5-point Likert scale reflecting the frequency of activities, for seven time windows.
RESULTS: Our final scale had 20 items divided among four dimensions: physical, cognitive, creative, and social. There were no issues related to multi-collinearity or non-collinearity. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) = 0.80 and Bartlett's test of sphericity indicated all values ≤0.01; Cronbach's alpha = 0.83.
DISCUSSION: We have validated a reliable, novel, easy to complete, and comprehensive scale to assess lifetime behaviors, which can be applied in research on AD risk reduction, mild cognitive impairment, and in clinical practice.
HIGHLIGHTS: Reserve, resistance, and resilience share similar adaptive mechanisms.Dynamic Neurocognitive Adaptation is a new scale to assess lifetime protective factors.Dynamic Neurocognitive Adaptation is a reliable, novel, and easy to complete scale.This approach can characterize specific life stages that are ripe for risk-reduction interventions.Our scale can be used to personalize health recommendations in aging.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39807629,Inhibition of IFITM3 in cerebrovascular endothelium alleviates Alzheimer's-related phenotypes.,"INTRODUCTION: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) modulates γ-secretase in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although IFITM3 knockout reduces amyloid β protein (Aβ) production, its cell-specific effect on AD remains unclear.
METHODS: Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was used to assess IFITM3 expression. Adeno-associated virus-BI30 (AAV-BI30) was injected to reduce IFITM3 expression in the cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVECs). The effects on AD phenotypes in cells and AD mice were examined through behavioral tests, two-photon imaging, flow cytometry, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR).
RESULTS: IFITM3 expression was increased in the CVECs of patients with AD. Overexpression of IFITM3 in primary endothelial cells enhanced Aβ generation through regulating beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ further increased IFITM3 expression, creating a vicious cycle. Knockdown of IFITM3 in CVECs decreased Aβ accumulation within cerebrovascular walls, reduced Alzheimer's-related pathology, and improved cognitive performance in AD transgenic mice.
DISCUSSION: Knockdown of IFITM3 in CVECs alleviates AD pathology and cognitive impairment. Targeting cerebrovascular endothelial IFITM3 holds promise for AD treatment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) expression was increased in the cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVECs) of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cerebrovascular endothelial IFITM3 regulates amyloid β protein (Aβ) generation through regulating beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Knockdown of IFITM3 in CVECs reduces Aβ deposits and improves cognitive impairments in AD transgenic mice.

39687016,BMAL1 upregulates STX17 levels to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion in hippocampal neurons to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease.,"We aim to investigate muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1) regulation of syntaxin17 (STX17) in mouse hippocampal neurons, focusing on autophagy and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion in APP/PS1 hippocampal tissues was observed using transmission electron microscopy, while mRNA levels of LC3II and P62 were measured via reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) after Amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression. STX17, linked to autophagy and differentially expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, was knocked down or overexpressed to assess its effects. The results showed that reduced STX17 impairs autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading to abnormal Aβ deposition. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescence confirmed STX17 interaction with SNAP29 and VAMP8 to form SNARE complexes. Furthermore, BMAL1 binding to STX17 was examined using luciferase assays. Circadian rhythm disturbances and decreased BMAL1 expression in APP/PS1 mice were noted, while BMAL1 overexpression upregulated STX17 expression and promoted autophagy to reduce Aβ deposition. Thus, the BMAL1 protein can promote STX17 transcription to induce STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 complex formation to clear intracellular Aβ through autophagy.",iScience,2024
40148290,Dietary inflammatory index and brain disorders: a Large Prospective Cohort study.,"There is emerging evidence that diet plays a key contributor to brain health, however, limited studies focused on the association of dietary inflammatory potential with brain disorders. This study aimed to examine the association of dietary inflammation with brain disorders in the UK biobank. The prospective cohort study used data from 2006 to 2010 from the UK Biobank, with the median follow-up duration for different outcomes ranging between 11.37 to 11.38. Dietary inflammatory index and Energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index [DII and EDII] were assessed through plausible dietary recalls. Outcomes included brain disorders (all-cause dementia [ACD], Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], stroke, sleep disorder, anxiety and depression disorder) and brain magnetic resonance imaging measures. Cox proportional-hazard models, restricted cubic spline model [RCS], Ordinary least squares regressions, and structural equation models were used to estimate associations. Of 164,863 participants with available and plausible dietary recalls, 87,761 (53.2%) were female, the mean (SD) age was 58.97 (8.05) years, and the mean (SD) education years was 7.49 (2.97) years. Vegetables and fresh fruits show significant anti-inflammatory properties, while low-fiber bread and animal fats show pro-inflammatory properties. The nonlinear associations of DII and EDII scores with ACD, AD, sleep disorder, stroke, anxiety, and depression were observed. Multivariable-adjusted HRs for participants in highest DII score VS lowest DII score were 1.165 (95% CI 1.038-1.307) for ACD, 1.172 (95% CI 1.064-1.291) for sleep disorder, 1.110 (95% CI 1.029-1.197) for stroke, 1.184 (95% CI 1.111-1.261) for anxiety, and 1.136 (95% CI 1.057-1.221) for depression. Similar results were observed with regard to EDII score. Compared with the lowest EDII score group, the highest group showed a higher risk of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, stroke and dementia. Results from sensitivity analyses and multivariable analyses were similar to the main results. Pro-inflammatory diets were associated with a higher risk of brain disorders. Our findings suggest a potential means of diet to lower risk of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, stroke, and dementia.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
39885278,"Alzheimer's disease may develop from changes in the immune system, cell cycle, and protein processing following alterations in ribosome function.","The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing as society ages. The details of AD pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated, and a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the process leading up to the onset of AD would be helpful for understanding the mechanism. We performed an RNA sequencing analysis on a cohort of 1227 Japanese blood samples, representing 424 AD patients, 543 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 260 cognitively normal (CN) individuals. A total of 883 and 1169 statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between CN and MCI (CN-MCI) and between MCI and AD (MCI-AD), respectively. Pathway analyses using these DEGs, followed by protein-protein interaction network analysis, revealed key roles of ribosomal function in MCI progression, whereas immune responses, cell cycle, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum were involved in AD progression. Our findings indicate that the onset of AD might be associated with gene expression changes in the immune system, cell cycle, and protein processing following alterations in the expression of ribosomal protein genes during the MCI stage, although validation using brain tissue samples will be necessary in the future. Given the known effectiveness of delaying MCI progression in preventing AD, the genes related to ribosomal function might emerge as biomarkers for early diagnosis.",Sci Rep,2025
39844286,APOE Christchurch enhances a disease-associated microglial response to plaque but suppresses response to tau pathology.,"BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A recent case report identified a rare variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether and how this variant exerts its protective effects.
METHODS: We introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial omics and bulk proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD pathological development and the brain's response to plaques and tau.
RESULTS: In 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of ApoeCh. Bulk proteomics show upregulated mitochondrial protein abundance with ApoeCh in 5xFAD mice, but reductions in mitochondrial and translation associated proteins in PS19 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variant's protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in receptor binding and microglial programming.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39743558,Plasma phospho-tau217 as a predictive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease in a large south American cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Blood-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers have been increasingly employed for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring purposes, due to accuracy in distinguishing AD pathophysiologic process. Compared to other p-tau isoforms, plasma p-tau217 exhibits stronger associations with AD hallmarks in CSF and brain. However, most studies have been conducted in non-Hispanic Whites, limiting our understanding of the performances and utility of these biomarkers across ethnicities.
METHODS: We examined a cohort of Peruvians from the GAPP study, a recently established cohort of Peruvian mestizos from Lima and indigenous groups from Southern Peru (Aymaras and Quechuas). We tested plasma levels of p-tau using the Quanterix Simoa ALZpathp-tau217 assay in 525 samples and tested the association between p-tau217 and clinical diagnosis (healthy controls n = 234 vs. AD n = 113) using generalized mixed regression models, adjusting for sex, age, education, APOE-e4 allele (fixed effects) and study site (random effect). We also tested biomarker levels in MCI (n = 178) vs. other groups. The receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the biomarker's classification performances.
RESULT: Participants showed on average 80% Native American ancestry. p-tau217 was significantly associated with AD (β = 2.61, 95%CI = 0.61-4.29) and its levels were inversely correlated with cognitive performances; p-tau217 levels did not differ between controls and MCI (p-value > 0.05). p-tau217 levels were higher in participants carrying at least one APOE-e4 allele (OR = 2.31, 95%CI = 1.85-2.90). The ROC-AUC for p-tau217 was estimated at 82.82% in the fully adjusted model.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study conducted in a South American cohort phenotyped for AD with available p-tau217. Most investigations have previously focused on highly selected cohorts with established AD-endophenotypes (CSF biomarkers, autopsy report, PET etc.), while data on cohorts with clinical assessment are currently lacking, especially in non-European populations.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025

39800395,Effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function and quality of life in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have examined the effects of physical activity on cognitive performance and executive function in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the findings are not entirely consistent. There are also insufficient study reviews for specific workout and assessment tool types. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the effects of aerobic exercise on the quality of life, cognitive performance and depressive symptoms in people with AD.
DESIGN: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, systematic reviews and meta-analyses using random-effects modelling, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL and CNKI through 12 March 2024.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The analysis includes all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used aerobic exercise as an intervention for individuals with AD.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two writers selected and searched for data using defined techniques. To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity between studies, meta-regression was carried out using Stata MP V.18.0 and V.14.0 software, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs were computed, and data were reviewed using Review Manager V.5.4 software, which was made available by the Cochrane Collaboration. Sensitivity analyses were employed to ascertain the stability and reliability of the results, and funnel plots and Egger's test were employed to check for publication bias. Correction and assessment of publication bias was done using Duval and Tweedie clipping methods.
RESULTS: Aerobic exercise enhanced cognitive function. For the Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) (SMD=0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32, Z=5.06, p<0.00001), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-cog) (SMD=-0.67, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.2, Z=2.77, p=0.006) and quality of life (SMD=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.64, Z=2.51, p=0.01), but not statistically significant for depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.25, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.13, Z=1.27, p=0.21). Subgroup analysis showed that duration greater than 16 weeks and less than 50 min per intervention improved MMSE Scores. Duration greater than 16 weeks and more than 30 min per intervention improved ADAS-cog Scores in patients with AD. Aerobic exercise greater than 16 weeks, with more than three interventions per week and 30-50 min per intervention improves quality of life in patients with AD.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that aerobic exercise was conducive to the improvement of cognitive function and quality of life among patients with AD, yet it did not exert a significant impact on the amelioration of depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, given the high level of heterogeneity and the variations in the quality of the included studies, the conclusions require further verification through more scientifically objective RCTs.

40147601,Ensemble network using oblique coronal MRI for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary degenerative brain disorder commonly found in the elderly, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be considered a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, distinguishing between normal aging and disease-induced neurofunctional impairments is crucial in clinical treatment. Although deep learning methods have been widely applied in Alzheimer's diagnosis, the varying data formats used by different methods limited their clinical applicability. In this study, based on the ADNI dataset and previous clinical diagnostic experience, we propose a method using oblique coronal MRI to assist in diagnosis. We developed an algorithm to extract oblique coronal slices from 3D MRI data and used these slices to train classification networks. To achieve subject-wise classification based on 2D slices, rather than image-wise classification, we employed ensemble learning methods. This approach fused classification results from different modality images or different positions of the same modality images, constructing a more reliable ensemble classification model. The experiments introduced various decision fusion and feature fusion schemes, demonstrating the potential of oblique coronal MRI slices in assisting diagnosis.

40110626,Blood biomarkers differentiate AD-related versus non-AD-related cognitive deficits.,"INTRODUCTION: The utility of blood-based biomarkers for discriminating Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related versus non-AD-related cognitive deficits in preclinical populations remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the capability of blood markers to detect and discriminate variation in performance across multiple cognitive domains in a cognitively unimpaired sample.
METHODS: Participants (n = 648, aged 69.9 ± 3.8, 71% female) underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and assays for plasma-based biomarkers amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/1-40 by mass spectrometry, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, p-tau217/Aβ1-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL).
RESULTS: Greater p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory performance (β = -0.11, SE = 0.04, p = .003), and remained so after covarying for NfL. Higher NfL was non-specifically associated with poorer performance across a range of cognitive domains and remained so after covarying for p-tau217.
DISCUSSION: Blood-based biomarkers may differentiate non-AD-related versus AD-related cognitive deficits. This characterization will be important for early intervention and disease monitoring for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: There is heterogeneity in the causes of cognitive decline in aging. AD-related blood biomarkers may help characterize these causes. Elevated p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory. Elevated NfL was associated with poorer cognition in a broad range of domains. Blood biomarkers may help differentiate AD- and non-AD-related cognitive deficits.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39935412,Transcriptome analysis of early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Korean cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanisms underlying early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) remain incompletely understood, particularly in Asian populations.
METHODS: RNA-sequencing was carried out on blood samples from 248 participants in the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital cohort to perform differential gene expression (DGE) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Findings were replicated in an independent Korean cohort (N = 275).
RESULTS: DGE analysis identified 18 and 88 dysregulated genes in EOAD and LOAD, respectively. Network analysis identified a LOAD-associated module showing a significant enrichment in pathways related to mitophagy, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. In the replication cohort, downregulation of SMOX and PLVAP in LOAD was replicated, and the LOAD-associated module was highly preserved. In addition, SMOX and PLVAP were associated with brain amyloid beta deposition.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest distinct molecular signatures for EOAD and LOAD in a Korean population, providing deeper understanding of their diagnostic potential and molecular mechanisms.
HIGHLIGHTS: Analysis identified 18 and 88 dysregulated genes in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), respectively. Expression levels of SMOX and PLVAP were downregulated in LOAD. Expression levels of SMOX and PLVAP were associated with brain amyloid beta deposition. Pathways including mitophagy and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling were enriched in a LOAD module. A LOAD module was highly preserved across two independent cohorts.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40008914,Independent associations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the independent associations between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
METHODS: Among 177,680 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who completed a survey on health risks, we residualized TGs and HDL-C conditional on age, sex, and body mass index. We included these residuals individually and concurrently in Cox models predicting ADRD incidence.
RESULTS: Low (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.10) and high quintiles (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.12) of HDL-C residuals were associated with an increased risk of ADRD compared to the middle quintile. Additional adjustment for TGs attenuated the association with high HDL-C (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08). Low TG residuals were associated with an increased ADRD risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.15); high TG residuals were protective (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). These estimates were unaffected by HDL-C adjustment.
DISCUSSION: Low HDL-C and TG levels are independently associated with increased ADRD risk. The correlation with low TG level explains the association of high HDL-C with ADRD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Strong correlations between lipid levels are important considerations when investigating lipids as late-life risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) were independently associated with an increased risk of ADRD. We found no evidence for an association between high HDL-C and increased ADRD risk after adjustment for TGs. High levels of TGs were consistently associated with a decreased risk of ADRD. There may be interaction between TG and HDL-C levels, where both low HDL-C and TG levels increase the risk of ADRD compared to average levels of both.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39689736,Co-administration of coenzyme Q10 and curcumin mitigates cognitive deficits and exerts neuroprotective effects in aluminum chloride-induced Alzheimer's disease in aged mice.,"Aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>), a known neurotoxic and Alzheimerogenic metal disrupts redox homeostasis which plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly cognitive decline. The current study was designed to unveil the long-term neuroprotective outcomes and efficacy of CoQ10 and curcumin low dose (100 mg/kg each) combination in 18-months old geriatric male Balb/c mice subjected to AlCl<sub>3</sub>-prompted memory derangements (200 mg/kg in water bottles) for 28 days. The neuroprotective properties driven by antioxidant mechanisms were assessed via observing cellular pathology in key-memory related brain regions including the cornuammonis (CA3 and DG) and cortex 2/3 layer. Our outcomes revealed that AlCl<sub>3</sub> exposure significantly reduced spatial learning and memory. In contrast, CoQ10 and curcumin combinatorial regime markedly mitigated cognitive deficits Vs. individual high-dose in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-treated animals as demonstrated by their improved performance in neurobehavioral tests such as the Y-maze, novel object recognition, passive avoidance and Morris-water maze test. Additionally, CoQ10 and curcumin co-administration restored redox balance by significantly reducing the levels of oxidative stressor (MDA) and increasing the anti-oxidant capacity (SOD,GPx). AchE is an enzyme involved in acetylcholine breakdown which negatively impacts acetylcholine levels and memory function. AlCl<sub>3</sub> exposure elevated AchE levels in mice brains vs. treatment. This neurochemical alteration was notably reversed in the dual-treatment group. Furthermore, CoQ10 and curcumin ameliorated AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced neurotoxicity by preserving neuronal cytoarchitecture in both cortical and hippocampal regions. In conclusion, CoQ10 and curcumin combination might attenuate memory loss induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub>-intoxication via restoring aberrant AchE activity, enhanced anti-oxidant defenses and salvaging the deleterious neuronal damage.",Exp Gerontol,2025
40151521,Plasma biomarker trajectories: Impact of AD genetic risk and clinical progression.,"INTRODUCTION: We examined long-term plasma biomarker trajectories among participants who were cognitively unimpaired and primarily middle aged at baseline and whether trajectories differed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk and among those who developed cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)<sub>181</sub>, neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells, and chitinase 3-like protein 1 were measured longitudinally in 177 BIOCARD participants (M baseline age = 57.7 years; M follow-up = 15.8 years), including 57 who developed cognitive impairment. Measures of AD genetic risk included apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and an AD polygenic risk score (AD-PRS).
RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, APOE ε4 carriers had lower Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> and greater longitudinal increases in p-tau<sub>181</sub> and GFAP; in contrast, the AD-PRS (excluding the APOE region) was associated with greater declines in Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Rates of increase in p-tau<sub>181</sub>, NfL, and GFAP were greater among those who later developed cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Monitoring changes in plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub>, NfL, and GFAP may be particularly informative during preclinical AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We examined plasma biomarker changes in cognitively normal individuals over 15.8 years.Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 was related to lower amyloid beta (Aβ)<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> and greater increases in phosphorylated tau (p-tau)<sub>181</sub> and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).In APOE ε4 non-carriers, higher Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score was related to greater Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> declines.P-tau<sub>181</sub>, NfL, and GFAP increases were greater among those who progressed to mild cognitive impairment.Results highlight the predictive value of plasma biomarkers during preclinical AD.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40112330,"Diagnostic journey and management of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia: A multinational, real-world survey.","BackgroundAn Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis made in the earliest symptomatic stages substantially benefits patients and their care partners. However, little is known regarding the clinical, healthcare system-level, and patient-specific barriers that hinder timely diagnosis and treatment.ObjectiveTo explore real-world practices surrounding the diagnostic journey and management of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD dementia patients.MethodsData were drawn from Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease Specific Programme™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians treating MCI/AD dementia patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan between 2022 and 2024.ResultsOverall, 779 physicians reported data on 5551 patients. Physicians indicated current disease severity for 5421 patients; 37.2% had MCI (87.3% with suspected prodromal AD and 12.7% undetermined etiology), 17.2% AD with mild dementia, 31.1% AD with moderate dementia, and 14.5% AD with severe dementia. When not immediately diagnosed, the median time from first consultation to initial diagnosis was 8.9 and 12.6 weeks when patients first consulted and were diagnosed by either a primary care practitioner (PCP) or a specialist, respectively, compared with 21.6 weeks when a PCP referred to a specialist for diagnosis. Diagnostic delays were predominantly due to specialist wait times. Few patients had diagnostic AD biomarker tests (cerebrospinal fluid testing 9.5%, amyloid positron emission tomography 3.7%, AD-blood tests 5.3%).ConclusionsTimely MCI and AD diagnosis is impeded by referral delays and limited use of biomarker testing. Addressing these critical care gaps requires enhanced physician training, reduced wait times and increased biomarker utilization for early management.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39719599,3-Dimensional morphological characterization of neuroretinal microglia in Alzheimer's disease via machine learning.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects 47.5 million people worldwide. AD is characterised by the formation of plaques containing extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins (pTau). Aβ gradually accumulates in the brain up to 20 years before the clinical onset of dementia, making it a compelling candidate for early detection of AD. It has been shown that there is increased deposition of Aβs in AD patients' retinas. However, little is known about microglia's ability to function and clear Aβ within the retina of AD and control eyes. We labelled microglia with ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) in AD and age-matched control donor retinas. We then used interactive machine learning to segment individual microglia in 3D. In the temporal mid-peripheral region, we found that the number of microglia was significantly lower in AD retinas compared to controls. Unexpectedly, the size of the microglia was significantly larger in the AD retinas compared to controls. We also labelled retinal microglia for Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68), a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by cells in the monocyte lineage and a marker of phagocytic activity and activated microglia. The size of CD68 + cells was statistically different between AD and control microglial, with CD68 + cells being larger in AD. In contrast, there was no difference in either size or shape for CD68- microglia between the two groups, suggesting an important difference in the active states of CD68 + microglia in AD retina. There was also significantly increased CD68 immunoreactivity in individual microglia within the AD group. Overall, this study reveals unique differences in the size and activity of the retinal microglia, which may relate to their potential chronic activation due to increased levels of Aβs in the AD retina.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2024
40194181,Social Risk Factor Domains and Dementia in Medicare Beneficiaries Over 65 (P6-3.007).,"OBJECTIVE: To examine independent associations of social risk factor domains with dementia among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older.
BACKGROUND: Dementia is a leading cause of disability in older adults. In recent years, social factors have been increasingly recognized as contributors to accelerated brain aging. Understanding these associations may inform the development of evidence-based social interventions as preventative strategies against cognitive decline.
DESIGN/METHODS: We followed the STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies and utilized National Health Interview Study data from 2019-2022. The primary exposure variables included five social risk factor domains: economic instability, educational deficits, food insecurity, social isolation, and inadequate access to healthcare. The primary outcome was any past diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Logistic regression models assessed associations between each social risk domain and dementia, adjusted for age, race, and comorbidities (obesity, depression, anxiety, stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, asthma, COPD, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, and arthritis). All risk domains were included in the same regression model. Analyses were weighted using the 'survey' package in R (version 4.3.1), and statistical significance was set at P<0.05.
RESULTS: This study included 31,664 unweighted participants (weighted n=51,609,990). Average age was 74.0 years (SE=0.046), with 55.3% female, 76.8% non-Hispanic White, 9.1% non-Hispanic Black, 4.5% non-Hispanic Asian, and 8.1% Hispanic participants. Fully-adjusted models showed economic instability (OR 1.31; 95% CI [1.10, 1.56], p < 0.01), educational deficits (OR 1.90; 95% CI [1.55, 2.32], p < 0.001), and social isolation (OR 2.87; 95% CI [2.46, 3.33], p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased odds of dementia. Food insecurity and access to healthcare were not significantly associated with dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy initiatives addressing economic instability, educational deficits, and social isolation may reduce the risk of dementia in older adults.

39845935,Molecular profiling of frontal and occipital subcortical white matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are commonly detected on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, occurring in both typical aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite their frequent appearance and their association with cognitive decline in AD, the molecular factors contributing to WMHs remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of two commonly affected brain regions with coincident AD pathology-frontal subcortical white matter (frontal-WM) and occipital subcortical white matter (occipital-WM)-and compared with age-matched cognitively intact controls. Through RNA-sequencing in frontal- and occipital-WM bulk tissues, we identified an upregulation of genes associated with brain vasculature function in AD white matter. To further elucidate vasculature-specific transcriptomic features, we performed RNA-seq analysis on blood vessels isolated from these white matter regions, which revealed an upregulation of genes related to protein folding pathways. Finally, comparing gene expression profiles between AD individuals with high- versus low-WMH burden showed an increased expression of pathways associated with immune function. Taken together, our study characterizes the diverse molecular profiles of white matter changes in AD and provides mechanistic insights into the processes underlying AD-related WMHs.",Front Neurol,2024

In this longitudinal cohort study of 145 elderly Brazilians, we assess the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers, based on clinical diagnosis and CSF biomarker positivity. Follow-up data of up to 4.7 years were used to determine performance in predicting diagnostic conversions. Participants were clinically categorized as cognitively unimpaired (n = 49), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 29), AD (n = 38), Lewy body dementia (n = 22), or vascular dementia (n = 7). Plasma Tau, Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, NfL, GFAP, pTau231, pTau181 and pTau217 were measured on the SIMOA HD-X platform. Plasma pTau217 showed excellent performance determining CSF biomarker status in the cohort, either alone (ROC AUC = 0.94, 95% CI: [0.88-1.00]) or as a ratio to Aβ<sub>42</sub> (ROC AUC = 0.98, 95% CI: [0.94-1.00]).

39772858,"Medications and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: Cohort cluster analysis of 15,428 patients.","BACKGROUND: Medications for comorbid conditions may affect cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between common medications and cognition, measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination.
METHODS: Cohort study including persons with AD from the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders (SveDem). Medications were included if they were used by ≥5% of patients (26 individual drugs). Each follow-up was analyzed independently by performing 100 Monte-Carlo simulations of two steps each 1) k-means clustering of patients according to Mini-Mental State Examination at follow-up and its decline since previous measure, and 2) Identification of medications presenting statistically significant differences in the proportion of users in the different clusters.
RESULTS: 15,428 patients (60.38% women) were studied. Four clusters were identified. Medications associated with the best cognition cluster (relative to the worse) were atorvastatin (point estimate 1.44 95% confidence interval [1.15-1.83] at first follow-up, simvastatin (1.41 [1.11-1.78] at second follow-up), warfarin (1.56 [1.22-2.01] first follow-up), zopiclone (1.35 [1.15-1.58], and metformin (2.08 [1.35-3.33] second follow-up. Oxazepam (0.60 [0.50-0.73] first follow-up), paracetamol (0.83 [0.73-0.95] first follow-up), cyanocobalamin, felodipine and furosemide were associated with the worst cluster. Cholinesterase inhibitors were associated with the best cognition clusters, whereas memantine appeared in the worse cognition clusters, consistent with its indication in moderate to severe dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: We performed unsupervised clustering to classify patients based on their current cognition and cognitive decline from previous testing. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, warfarin, metformin, and zopiclone presented a positive and statistically significant associations with cognition, while oxazepam, cyanocobalamin, felodipine, furosemide and paracetamol, were associated with the worst cluster.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40193908,Mortality Patterns in Patients with Diabetes and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease in the United States: A Retrospective Analysis from 1999 to 2020 (P6-3.017).,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to identify the mortality patterns related to late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus in older adults in the United States (US), stratified by age, sex, race or ethnicity, region, state, and area; and to investigate any changes in the mortality trends.
BACKGROUND: Late-onset AD refers to the occurrence of AD after the age of 65. It is the primary cause of late-onset dementia. Studies indicate that persons diagnosed with diabetes are more susceptible to late-onset AD. Diabetes manifests as insulin resistance, which can have significant effects on cognitive function and contribute to the development of AD.
DESIGN/METHODS: With the help of data retrieved from the CDC WONDER database, we were able to determine the crude death rates (CR) and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 individuals. We examined the changes in AAMR through annual percent change (APC) using Joinpoint regression.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2020, late-onset AD and diabetes were associated with 185,059 deaths in the older US population, demonstrating an increasing trend (average APC = 2.87). Females (20.38) had higher AAMR than males (19.62). Non-Hispanic (NH) African Americans experienced the highest AAMR (28.01), while non-Hispanic Asians experienced the lowest (16.09). AAMRs varied by region (West: 23.53, Midwest: 21.51, South: 21.0, Northeast: 13.50). States with the highest AAMR percent change were Nebraska and Louisiana; those with the lowest were Montana and New Hampshire. Most deaths occurred at hospice/nursing facilities (57.96%). Non-metropolitan areas showed a higher mortality burden (25.05) than metropolitan areas (19.02).
CONCLUSIONS: There was an increasing trend of late-onset AD and diabetes in the US, with high mortality rates in females, NH Black or African Americans, and in the West region. Future research should focus on targeted therapy for the vulnerable population, and the association between diabetes and AD should be studied to prevent its onset.

40169800,Higher plasma soluble TREM2 correlates with reduced cerebral tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Loss-of-function mutation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is associated with increased risks for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent animal studies reveal that the activation of peripheral TREM2 signaling may affect cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau aggregates. However, the underlying relationship between peripheral TREM2 and brain AD pathology has not yet been well-elucidated in the aging population. In this study, we collected 318 Chinese older adults with Aβ PET and plasma biomarker measures, including soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a proxy for astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, 129 participants underwent tau PET scans. We explored the association between plasma sTREM2, GFAP, and primary AD pathology. Plasma sTREM2 was negatively associated with reduced temporal tau PET burden in participants with abnormal Aβ and tau pathology. Higher plasma sTREM2 was related to the weaker association of Aβ pathology and plasma phosphorylated tau with tau PET increases. In contrast, elevated plasma GFAP was related to greater Aβ and tau PET burden along with stronger Aβ-related tau accumulation. Finally, higher plasma sTREM2 was linked to attenuated strength of the association between plasma GFAP and tau PET increases at both pre-defined regions of interest and voxel levels. Altogether, our findings suggest distinct relationships between plasma sTREM2 and GFAP with cerebral tau pathology, providing novel insights into the roles of peripheral TREM2 signaling and astrocytic reactivity in AD neuropathological development. This study has important implications, such as targeting the peripheral TREM2 signature, which may be a potential strategy for future AD therapies.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
39840010,Alzheimer's disease and infectious agents: a comprehensive review of pathogenic mechanisms and microRNA roles.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia and is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. There are various theories concerning the causes of AD, but the connection between viral and bacterial infections and their potential role in the pathogenesis of AD has become a fascinating area of research for the field. Various viruses such as Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza viruses, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as bacteria such as Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), Helicobacter pylori (HP), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Spirochetes and eukaryotic unicellular parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii), have been linked to AD due to their ability to activate the immune system, induce inflammation and increase oxidative stress, thereby leading to cognitive decline and AD. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs) might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis mechanisms of these pathogens since they are utilized to target various protein-coding genes, allowing for immune evasion, maintaining latency, and suppressing cellular signaling molecules. Also, they can regulate gene expression in human cells. This article provides an overview of the association between AD and various infectious agents, with a focus on the mechanisms by which these pathogens may be related to the pathogenesis of AD. These findings suggest important areas for further research to be explored in future studies.",Front Neurosci,2024
39910202,Network pharmacology and experimental verification to investigate the mechanism of isoliquiritigenin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavone isolated from licorice, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular details of the contribution of ISL to AD remain largely elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ISL against AD. In this study, AD targets and ISL targets were collected via different databases. The overlapped targets between AD and ISL were generated with Venny. Then we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses on these common targets. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and clusters were obtained using the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) and the Cytohubba plugins. Further, molecular docking study was performed for these core targets. Subsequently, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the assessment of hub gene expression levels between AD and healthy individuals were used to estimate a possible link between target genes in AD. Finally, experiments were conducted to verify the therapeutic mechanism of ISL in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglial cells. GO and KEGG pathway analysis found that ISL was significantly enriched in regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The PPI network manifested 7 key targets including albumin (ALB), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ, PPARG). Molecular docking showed that ISL had high binding affinity with these key targets. The experimental results revealed that ISL decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and increased the expression of PPAR-γ, and suppressed the production of proinflammatory mediators. Our work revealed that ISL might be an effective treatment strategy in the treatment of AD by its anti-inflammatory effect towards microglia through the ERK/PPAR-γ pathway.",Sci Rep,2025
40191788,An imaging and genetic-based deep learning network for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Conventional computer-aided diagnostic techniques for Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominantly rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in isolation. Genetic imaging methods, by establishing the link between genes and brain structures in disease progression, facilitate early prediction of AD development. While deep learning methods based on MRI have demonstrated promising results for early AD diagnosis, the limited dataset size has led most AD studies to lean on statistical approaches within the realm of imaging genetics. Existing deep-learning approaches typically utilize pre-defined regions of interest and risk variants from known susceptibility genes, employing relatively straightforward feature fusion methods that fail to fully capture the relationship between images and genes. To address these limitations, we proposed a multi-modal deep learning classification network based on MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for AD diagnosis and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression prediction. Our model leveraged a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract whole-brain structural features, a Transformer network to capture genetic features, and employed a cross-transformer-based network for comprehensive feature fusion. Furthermore, we incorporated an attention-map-based interpretability method to analyze and elucidate the structural and risk variants associated with AD and their interrelationships. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using 1,541 subjects from the ADNI database. Experimental results underscored the superior performance of our model in effectively integrating and leveraging information from both modalities, thus enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis and prediction.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39775804,Development and Validation of a Tool to Predict Onset of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Dementia.,"IMPORTANCE: The ability to predict the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer dementia (AD) could allow older adults and clinicians to make informed decisions about dementia care.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the age at onset of MCI and AD can be predicted using a statistical modeling approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used data from 2 aging and dementia cohort studies-the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-for model development and validation of the Florey Dementia Index (FDI), a tool used to predict the age at onset of MCI and AD in older adults. Data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer (A4) study were used for a simulated trial. Data were collected from 1665 AIBL participants, 2029 ADNI participants, and 93 A4 participants from October 1, 2004, to March 1, 2023. The data analysis was conducted between January and August 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predicted age at onset compared with clinically observed age at onset.
RESULTS: Among the 1665 AIBL participants (741 [44.5%] female) and 2029 ADNI participants (925 [45.6%] female), the mean (SD) age at first evaluation was 71.8 (7.1) years and 74.5 (6.7) years, respectively. The FDI achieved mean absolute errors of 2.78 (95% CI, 2.63-2.93) years for predicting MCI onset and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.32-1.65) years for predicting AD onset. In the simulated trial with 93 A4 participants (48 [51.6%] female; mean [SD] age at baseline, 73.4 [5.1] years), the FDI achieved mean absolute errors of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.41-1.71) years for predicting MCI onset and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.88) years for predicting AD onset.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, the FDI was developed and validated to predict the onset age of MCI and AD. This tool may be useful in organizing health care for older adults with cognitive decline or dementia and in the future may help prioritize patients for the use of disease-modifying monoclonal antibody drugs.",JAMA Netw Open,2025
39740121,Paving the way for Alzheimer's disease blood-based biomarkers in primary care.,"Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have the potential to revolutionize the detection and management of cognitive impairment. AD BBBMs are not currently recommended for use in primary care but may soon be as research demonstrates their clinical utility for differential diagnosis and patient management. To prepare for the incorporation of AD BBBMs into primary care, several practical challenges must be addressed. Here, we describe four immediate challenges: (1) preparing primary care providers to order and disclose AD BBBMs, (2) expanding the dementia-capable workforce, (3) ensuring equitable uptake of AD BBBM testing, and (4) securing access to AD treatment. We conclude by discussing future directions and challenges for use of AD BBBMs in primary care, including screening for preclinical AD and dementia detection algorithms. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) may be well suited for primary care. Many changes are needed to prepare the workforce and ensure patient access. Paving the way for AD BBBMs in primary care will require a multi-pronged approach.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39757624,Radio-Anatomical Assessment of Cerebellum Volume in Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic brain disease that includes memory and language disorders. This disease, which is considered the most common cause of dementia worldwide, accounts for 60-80% of all dementia cases. Recent studies suggest that the cerebellum may play a role in cognitive functions as well as motor functions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 40 Alzheimer's patients and 40 healthy individuals. In our study, volumetric evaluation of the cerebellum was performed.
RESULTS: As expected, significant differences were found in cerebellar volume reduction in AD patients compared to healthy controls. Significant volume increase was observed in some regions of the cerebellum in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy individuals.
CONCLUSION: The findings supported the role of the cerebellum in cognitive functions. Volume reductions may assist clinicians in making an early diagnosis of AD.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
39760224,"Microglial Responses to Alzheimer's Disease Pathology: Insights From ""Omics"" Studies.","Human genetics studies lent firm evidence that microglia are key to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis over a decade ago following the identification of AD-associated genes that are expressed in a microglia-specific manner. However, while alterations in microglial morphology and gene expression are observed in human postmortem brain tissue, the mechanisms by which microglia drive and contribute to AD pathology remain ill-defined. Numerous mouse models have been developed to facilitate the disambiguation of the biological mechanisms underlying AD, incorporating amyloidosis, phosphorylated tau, or both. Over time, the use of multiple technologies including bulk tissue and single cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics have shed light on the heterogeneity of microglial phenotypes and molecular patterns altered in AD mouse models. Each of these 'omics technologies provide unique information and biological insight. Here, we review the literature on the approaches and findings of these methods and provide a synthesis of the knowledge generated by applying these technologies to mouse models of AD.",Glia,2025

A survey of Israeli specialists found that 84% were familiar with new ATT, but 60% raised doubts about their ability to significantly impact disease progression. Neurologists were more likely to recommend these treatments, but concerns included treatment costs and limited real-world experience. The decision to refer patients was influenced by patient age, financial status, and diagnostic test availability.

40045432,Structural and functional studies of the VAPB-PTPIP51 ER-mitochondria tethering proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria regulates many of the seemingly disparate physiological functions that are damaged in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A number of studies have now demonstrated that ER-mitochondria signaling is perturbed in these diseases and there is evidence that this may be a driving mechanism in disease onset and progression. VAPB and PTPIP51 are ER-mitochondria tethering proteins; VAPB is an ER protein and PTPIP51 is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein and the two proteins interact to enable inter-organelle signaling. The VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, FTD and ALS. Here we review the roles of VAPB and PTPIP51 in ER-mitochondria signaling and the mechanisms by which neurodegenerative disease insults may disrupt the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
39907903,Silica Nanoparticles Induce SH-SY5Y Cells Death Via PARP and Caspase Signaling Pathways.,"A growing stream of research indicates that exposure to Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) can cause nervous system damage, leading to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the specific mechanism by which SiNPs cause neuroblast injury remains unclear and requires further research. This study established an in vitro experimental model of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to SiNPs and observed cell growth through an inverted fluorescence microscope. Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. The intracellular ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were detected by flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was observed using both Hoechst33342 staining and TUNEL staining. The activities of SOD and ATPase and the content of ATP in the cells were tested by biochemical methods. The genes including parp-1, aif, par, ucp2, vdac and prdx3 were explored using quantitative real-time PCR. The expressions of PARP, AIF, PAR, Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and Cyt C proteins were evaluated by Western Blot. The immunofluorescence technique was used to observe the distribution of Parthanatos-related proteins induced by SiNPs. The results showed that SiNPs reduced cell survival rate, induced excessive ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, decreased SOD activity, ATPase activity, intracellular and mitochondrial ATP content, increased the expression of mitochondrial function and PARP pathway related genes, as well as PARP and Caspase pathway protein expression, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. As a further test of the roles of PARP and Caspase pathways in SiNPs induced SH-SY5Y cells death, we selected the PARP inhibitor Olaparib and Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, and the above effects were significantly improved after treatment with the inhibitors. Conclusively, this study confirmed that SiNPs can generate excessive ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells, alter mitochondrial function, and induce cell death through Parthanatos and caspase dependent apoptotic pathways, which can coexist and interact with each other.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40149774,Phytochemicals Targeting BDNF Signaling for Treating Neurological Disorders.,"Neurological disorders are defined by a deterioration or disruption of the nervous system's structure and function. These diseases, which include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia, are caused by intricate pathological processes that include excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, genetic mutations, and compromised neurotrophic signaling. Although current pharmaceutical treatments relieve symptoms, their long-term efficacy is limited due to adverse side effects and weak neuroprotective properties. However, when combined with other neuroprotective drugs or adjunct therapy, they may offer additional benefits and improve treatment outcomes. Phytochemicals have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents due to their ability to regulate essential neurotrophic pathways, especially the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade. BDNF is an important target for neurodegenerative disease (ND) treatment since it regulates neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. This review emphasizes the molecular pathways through which various phytochemicals-such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds-stimulate BDNF expression and modulate its downstream signaling pathways, including GSK-3β, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, CREB, and Wnt/β-catenin. This paper also highlights how phytochemical combinations may interact to enhance BDNF activity, offering new therapeutic options for ND treatment. Despite their potential for neuroprotection, phytochemicals face challenges related to pharmacokinetics, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and absorption, highlighting the need for further research into combination therapies and improved formulations. Clinical assessment and mechanistic understanding of BDNF-targeted phytotherapy should be the main goals of future studies. The therapeutic efficacy of natural compounds in regulating neurotrophic signaling is highlighted in this review, providing a viable approach to the prevention and treatment of NDs.",Brain Sci,2025
39791487,Neuropsychological test performance in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: We sought to characterize the cognitive profile among individuals with mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) to help guide future clinical criteria.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis included MCI-LB studies with cognitive data from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (January 1990 to March 2023). MCI-LB scores were compared to controls, MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) groups with random-effects models.
RESULTS: We included 26 studies and 2823 participants. Across all domains, the MCI-LB group performed worse than controls and better than DLB. Compared to MCI-AD, the MCI-LB group performed worse in attention/processing speed (g = -0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.35, -0.12), attention/executive (g = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.56, -0.28); better in verbal immediate recall (g = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.59) and delayed memory (g = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.58).
DISCUSSION: The cognitive profiles in MCI-LB and MCI-AD are consistent with established profiles in DLB and AD. Neuropsychological assessment may be helpful in differential diagnosis, even in early disease states.
HIGHLIGHTS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for cognition in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB). Compared to MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), MCI-LB had worse attention, executive function, and processing speed. Compared to MCI-AD, MCI-LB had better verbal immediate and delayed recall. The MCI-LB group was worse on all cognitive domains than controls, and better than dementia with Lewy bodies.

39931857,"Preclinical Pharmacology of CX1837, a High-Impact Ampakine with an Improved Safety Margin: Implications for Treating Alzheimer's Disease and Ischemic Stroke.","INTRODUCTION: For over a decade, AMPA receptor allosteric potentiators (AMPAkines) have shown significant effectiveness in multiple preclinical studies related to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders underpinned by deficient excitatory synaptic activity. Despite promising preclinical evidence, the clinical translation of AMPAkines has been slow due to the propensity of some of these compounds to produce seizures at or around therapeutic doses. Materials and: Methods: The preclinical activity of the AMPAkine CX1837 is disclosed in the current work.
RESULTS: CX1837 enhanced synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices in vitro and dose-dependently enhanced long-term potentiation, which is believed to control memory consolidation. CX1837 boosted performance in cognition tests, such as the novel object recognition test and the win-shift radial arm maze. CX1837 also increased attentional functioning in the 5-choice serial reaction time task involving rats. CX1837 produced positive preclinical effects at 0.01-1.0 mg/kg dose and elicited epileptic effects at 10 mg/kg dose.
DISCUSSION: CX1837 has demonstrated to have one of the largest safety margins to date in preclinical studies. Low doses of CX1837, which produce acute increases in cognition, may potentially increase neurotrophins when given chronically. This could slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease and reverse deficits secondary to ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSION: Together, our findings highlight CX1837 as a potential candidate for clinical development in order to treat multiple neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
40149831,Olfactory Testing and Gray Matter Volume: A Combined Approach to Predict the Conversion to Alzheimer.,"Background/Objectives: Olfactory decline is common in normal aging and frequent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it has been suggested as a marker for the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) progression to AD. Although suggested, the relationship between olfactory deficits and cerebral atrophy in MCI conversion to AD is still debated. This study aims at investigating the olfaction-related morphological and behavioural alterations in MCI in order to understand whether they can predict the progression to AD. Methods: Twenty-seven MCI patients and thirty-five healthy controls (HCs) took part in the study, with follow-up showing conversion to AD in thirteen patients (converter-MCI, cMCI). The Burgarth Sniffin' Sticks Tests (threshold-TT, discrimination-DT, identification-IT) assessed the olfactory capacities. The Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis investigated the atrophic patterns. Results: The Receiving Operating Characteristics analyses demonstrated that DT and IT could distinguish HC from MCI (DT Area Under Curve-AUC = 0.8; IT AUC = 0.8), as well as cMCI from sMCI (stable) patients (DT AUC = 0.7; IT AUC = 0.6), similarly to memory and executive functions tests. Olfactory performance positively correlated with memory tests in sMCI (all rhos ≥ 0.8, all ps &lt; 0.01), whereas it positively correlated with executive functions in cMCI (all rhos ≥ 0.6, all ps &lt; 0.05). VBM results revealed distinct atrophic patterns in cMCI, especially in the olfactory cortex, that were already present at the MCI diagnosis, before AD conversion. A larger volume of the olfactory cortex was associated with better memory and executive functions. Conclusions: Quantitative olfactory and morphological patterns represent non-invasive, predictive biomarkers of the MCI progression to AD; thus, their assessments at MCI onset allows earlier interventions for MCI patients.",Brain Sci,2025
40126600,Metformin Improves Spatial Memory and Reduces Seizure Severity in a Rat Model of Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease comorbidity via PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy. In our previous studies, we identified a partial AD-like phenotype associated with central insulin resistance in the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR), a genetic model of epilepsy. We also found that intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin, a compound used to model diabetes and AD, exacerbates seizure susceptibility. Given the role of insulin signaling in both AD and epilepsy, we hypothesized that metformin (MET), an anti-diabetic drug known for enhancing insulin sensitivity, could be a potential therapeutic agent for both conditions. Our objective was to investigate MET's effects on brain insulin signaling, seizure activity, and AD-like pathology in WARs. Adult male WARs received oral MET (250 mg/kg) for 21 days. Audiogenic seizures were assessed using the Categorized Severity Index and Racine's scale. Spatial memory was tested with the Morris water maze (MWM), followed by Western blot analysis of hippocampal proteins. MET significantly reduced seizure severity and improved MWM performance. Although MET did not affect insulin receptor levels or activation, it increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), activated Akt, and increased glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β (GSK-3α/β) levels. MET also decreased amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) levels but did not affect Tau phosphorylation. These results suggest that chronic MET treatment alleviates behaviors related to both AD and epilepsy in WARs and modulates insulin signaling independently of insulin receptor activation. Our findings highlight MET's potential as a therapeutic agent for managing comorbid AD and epilepsy, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39969678,IGF1R/ARRB1 Mediated Regulation of ERK and cAMP Pathways in Response to Aβ Unfolds Novel Therapeutic Avenue in Alzheimer's Disease.,"IGF1R/INSR signaling is crucial for understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may aid in the development of potent therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the expression and activity of these receptors and their potential to form functional hybrids in response to amyloid beta (Aβ). IGF1R, INSR, and ARRB1 were found to be upregulated in AD. The propensity for functional hybrid formation was also greater in the presence of Aβ. The association of IGF1R with ARRB1 reached a maximum at 60 min of Aβ treatment, which coincided with increased pERK activity at approximately the same time, indicating the importance of this association in pERK regulation. Knocking down IGF1R, INSR, and ARRB1 independently reduced cAMP, whereas overexpressing IGF1R significantly increased cAMP. Knocking down ARRB1 in IGF1R-overexpressing cells led to a reduction in cAMP, indicating that the interaction of ARRB1 and IGF1R possibly contributes to cAMP dysregulation. Since cAMP plays a crucial role in cognition and memory, alterations in cAMP after receptor hybridization could be significant in AD. Additionally, we noted hyperactivation of MAPK, which is associated with aberrant cellular activity, transcriptional control, and stress pathways. This finding highlights the importance of IGF1R and INSR dysregulation, which plays a major role in addition to conventional RTK signaling through multiple pathways. Here, we focused on the ARRB1 and IGF1R interaction and showed that picropodophyllin (PPP), an IGF1R-specific inhibitor, blocks this interaction and alters the ERK and cAMP status under disease conditions. Cell viability studies further revealed that the PPP substantially improved cell viability in the presence of Aβ. This highlights the role of the PPP in regulating these cascades and opens the arena for further therapeutic development for AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40116688,The effect of anti-seizure medications on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and AD-related symptoms: A scoping review.,"BackgroundAs the fastest-growing segment of the population, adults over 65 are at the most significant risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Older adults often use anti-seizure medications (ASMs), which can negatively impact cognitive function, mood, and behavior, mimicking AD or its symptoms. Understanding the effects of ASMs across diverse older adults is crucial, given that some ethnoracial groups are at higher risk for AD or more severe symptoms compared to non-Hispanic Whites.ObjectiveTo summarize the current evidence on the association of ASMs with AD risk and AD-related symptoms and explore the inclusion of ethnoracial minority groups in these studies.MethodsData sources included PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS for English-language studies published between 1990-2024. Selected studies were peer-reviewed, cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control, and clinical trials on AD dementia or related symptoms and ASMs. Study quality was rated by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Research Medicine.ResultsA total of 27 studies with 1,241,796 participants were included. Data on AD risk from level IB-IIIB evidence studies showed mixed results, with some indicating an increased association with ASM use [OR = 1.05-1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24]. Studies on AD-related symptoms from level IB-IV evidence also showed mixed results. Only three North American studies explicitly included race/ethnicity; most were conducted in European countries.ConclusionsASM use may be modestly associated with an increased risk of AD among the older adult population, but current data are inconclusive. The association of ASMs on AD-related symptoms varied. Future studies should emphasize reporting sociodemographic data and include diverse cohorts to enhance the applicability of findings.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40030015,Inhibition of amyloid beta oligomer accumulation by NU-9: A unifying mechanism for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11, e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22, 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025

40009262,Evolving Insights into Prickle2 in Neurodevelopment and Neurological Disorders.,"The development of neural circuits is a complex, highly coordinated process crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. This process involves the intricate interplay of numerous genes and signaling pathways. Prickle2, a protein encoded by the planar cell polarity (PCP) genes, is a key component of the noncanonical Wnt/PCP signaling pathway and plays a critical role in neural circuit development. Recent studies have highlighted the essential functions of Prickle2 in various stages of neural circuit formation, including the development of the initial segment of neuronal axons, axon elongation and regeneration, dendrite formation, synapse formation, and vesicle transport. The normal expression and spatial distribution of Prickle2 are vital for these processes, and its dysregulation has been associated with several neurological disorders, including congenital neural tube defects, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. This review aims to systematically summarize the upstream and downstream signaling pathways and regulatory interactions involving Prickle2 in neurodevelopment and neural circuit formation. By discussing the expression patterns of Prickle2 in neurodevelopment and its associations with neurological diseases, we provide insights into the mechanisms through which Prickle2 influences neurodevelopment and its potential implications in neurological disorders.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39688956,Statistical examination of shared loci in neuropsychiatric diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics.,"Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant 'local' genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter.",Elife,2024
39912452,Massive changes in gene expression and their cause(s) can be a unifying principle in the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease.,"Understanding of the biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has long been fragmented, with various investigators concentrating on amyloid beta (Aβ) or tau, inflammation, cell death pathways, misfolded proteins, glia, and more. Yet data from multiple authors has repeatedly shown altered expression of myriad genes related to these seemingly disparate phenomena. In 2022, Morgan et al. organized the massive data on changes in AD in a meticulous survey of the literature and related these changes to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Their data showed that 91% of the known KEGG pathways are involved in AD and that many of these pathways are represented by the known cellular/molecular phenomena of AD. Such data then raise the fundamental question: What mechanism(s) may be responsible for such widespread changes in gene expression? We review evidence for a unifying model based on sequestrations in stress granules and alteration of nucleocytoplasmic transport in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), critical changes take place in neurons before the appearance of plaques or tangles. Addressing these early changes provides a path to early detection and effective intervention in AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39737731,Resilience to Alzheimer's disease associates with alterations in perineuronal nets.,"INTRODUCTION: Some individuals show intact cognition despite the presence of neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The plasticity of parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons might contribute to resilience. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), that is, extracellular matrix structures around neurons, modulate PV neuron function. We hypothesize that PNNs play a role in resilience to AD.
METHODS: PNN amount and morphology were determined in immunolabelled sections of the frontal cortex of control, AD and resilient subjects. Expression levels of genes related to PNNs and microglia signatures were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The expression of the PNN-component aggrecan around PV neurons is decreased in resilient and AD subjects, whereas PNN-sugar chains are reduced only in resilient subjects. In AD, fewer presynaptic terminals on PV neurons are detected and genes related to PNN degradation are upregulated.
DISCUSSION: These data show distinct PNN changes in individuals resilient to AD, which may contribute to preserved cognition despite the neuropathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Aggrecan levels are decreased in the frontal cortex of AD and resilient subjects. In resilient subjects, WFA+ PNNs are reduced around neuronal somata. In AD patients, PV neurons show disrupted WFA peridendritic staining and synaptic loss. Expression levels of PNN-degrading enzymes are higher in AD. Excitatory neurons bearing a PNN show low amounts of ptau.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

METHODS: Two hundred twenty Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants with unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia completed the T-Cog during their annual UDS evaluation. We assessed administration feasibility and diagnostic group differences cross-sectionally across telephone versus videoconference modalities, and compared T-Cog to prior in-person UDS scores longitudinally.
RESULTS: Administration time averaged 54 min and 79% of participants who initiated a T-Cog completed all 12 subtests; completion time and rates differed by diagnostic group but not by modality. Performance varied expectedly across groups with moderate to strong associations between most T-Cog measures and in-person correlates, although select subtests demonstrated lower comparability.
DISCUSSION: The T-Cog is feasibly administered and shows preliminary validity in a cognitively heterogeneous cohort. Normative data from this cohort should be expanded to more diverse populations to enhance utility and generalizability.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study examined the feasibility and validity of the remote Uniform Data Set (also known as the T-Cog) and contributes key normative data for widespread use.A remote neuropsychological battery was feasibly administered with high overall engagement and completion rates, adequate reliability compared to in-person testing, and evidence of validity across diagnostic groups.Typical barriers to administration included hearing impairment, technology issues, and distractions; hearing difficulties were particularly common among cognitively impaired groups.Certain tests were less closely related to their in-person correlates and should be used with caution.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2024

Effective blood glucose management is essential, and sitagliptin (SITG), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, may offer neuroprotective benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: T2DM was induced in rats using nicotinamide (NICO) and streptozotocin (STZ), and biomarkers of AD and DM-linked enzymes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated in the brain. Computational studies supported the in vivo findings.
RESULTS: SITG significantly reduced the brain enzyme levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1), DPP-4, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in T2DM-induced rats. It also reduced inflammation by lowering cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Additionally, SITG improved oxidative stress markers by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhancing glutathione (GSH). It increased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) while reducing pro-apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) and Caspace-3. SITG also lowered blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels. To explore potential molecular level mechanisms, docking was performed on AChE, COX-2, GSK-3β, BACE-1, and Caspace-3. The potential binding affinity of SITG for the above-mentioned target enzymes were 10.8, 8.0, 9.7, 7.7, and 7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Further binding mode analysis of the lowest energy conformation revealed interactions with the critical residues.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight SITG's neuroprotective molecular targets in T2DM-associated neurodegeneration and its potential as a therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further clinical investigations.",Brain Sci,2024
40042512,"Chronic stress, social support, and Alzheimer's blood-based biomarkers in the HABS-HD study.","INTRODUCTION: High levels of chronic stress and low social support have been associated with worse cognition among older adults, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: We included 2117 older adults (mean age 65.5 years) enrolled in the Health and Aging Brain Study - Health Disparities (HABS-HD). Linear regression models evaluated the associations between social support or chronic stress and Alzheimer's-related blood-based biomarkers (BBMs), including amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, and total tau (t-tau). Interactions between chronic stress or social support and gender or race/ethnicity in relation to BBMs were assessed.
RESULTS: Higher chronic stress was associated with higher levels of t-tau. Higher social support was associated with lower levels of NfL. Neither gender nor race/ethnicity modified the associations between chronic stress or social support and BBM levels.
DISCUSSION: Chronic stress and social support are associated with BBMs of neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher chronic stress was associated with higher levels of plasma total tau. Higher social support was associated with lower levels of plasma neurofilament light chain. Neither gender nor race/ethnicity modified the associations between chronic stress or social support and levels of blood-based biomarkers. Chronic stress and social support affect pathways related to neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40111924,Biomarkers do not paint the whole picture: The role of clinical expertise and advanced neuroimaging for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Memory Clinics remains challenging due to the limited specificity of conventional clinical assessment and structural imaging. The recent commentary by Vyhnalek and colleagues advocates for the incorporation of molecular biomarkers for AD diagnosis in clinical practice. However, this approach only partially captures the complexity of disease expression due to co-pathologies such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, a mimic of AD. At the era of immunotherapy for AD, clinical expertise remains essential to identify AD from its mimics, especially when both entities co-exist, and may rely on advanced neuroimaging techniques such as brain connectivity.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40025716,Understanding causal estimates of smoking behaviors for cognitive impairment: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Smoking has been linked to dementia, but the causal relationship has not been well established.
OBJECTIVE: Our study used a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to examine the impact of different stages and kinds of smoking behavior on cognitive status.
METHODS: We analyzed a Health and Retirement Study sample, categorizing cognitive status into three levels (normal, cognitive impairment-no dementia, dementia) and using self-reported smoking behaviors. We used multivariable logistic regressions to examine associations and MR to examine potential causality. We used smoking polygenic scores as instruments for one-sample MR and validated through two-sample MR with genome-wide association study summary statistics.
RESULTS: Current smoking was associated with 1.33 times higher odds of cognitive impairment-no dementia (95% CI: 1.06, 1.65) in European ancestry participants (N = 7708). Among participants who had ever smoked, each 10 additional year of smoking was associated with 1.11 times higher odds of cognitive impairment-no dementia (95% CI: 1.10, 1.22). Using ever smoking polygenic score as a validated instrumental variable, we detected strong causal effects of ever smoking, current smoking, and total smoking years on cognitive impairment (all p < 0.001). Two-sample MR showed no evidence of causality between smoking behaviors and Alzheimer's disease. No causality was observed in the African ancestry sample (N = 1928).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking behavior was cross-sectionally associated with and potentially on the causal pathway of cognitive impairment-no dementia in the larger European ancestry sample. However, no associations were observed with dementia, and the findings did not replicate across ancestry groups. The causal relationship between smoking and cognitive health remains suggestive but not conclusive. Promoting smoking cessation remains a prudent public health strategy to prevent numerous health conditions, and its potential impact on cognitive health warrants further investigation.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39821479,Plasma N-terminal tau fragment is an amyloid-dependent biomarker in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Novel fluid biomarkers for tracking neurodegeneration specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are greatly needed.
METHODS: Using two independent well-characterized cohorts (n = 881 in total), we investigated the group differences in plasma N-terminal tau (NT1-tau) fragments across different AD stages and their association with cross-sectional and longitudinal amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Plasma NT1-tau significantly increased in symptomatic AD and displayed positive associations with Aβ PET (positron emission tomography) and tau PET. Higher baseline NT1-tau levels predicted greater tau PET, with 2- to 10-year intervals and faster longitudinal Aβ PET increases, AD-typical neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Plasma NT1-tau showed negative correlations with baseline regional brain volume and thickness, superior to plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL) in Aβ-positive participants.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that plasma NT1-tau is an Aβ-dependent biomarker and outperforms BD-tau and NfL in detecting cross-sectional neurodegeneration in the AD continuum.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma N-terminal tau (NT1-tau) was specifically increased in the A+/T+ stage. Plasma NT1-tau was positively associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau PET (positron emission tomography) accumulations. Higher plasma NT1-tau predicted greater tau burden and faster Aβ increases. Plasma NT1-tau was more related to neurodegeneration than plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and neurofilament light (NfL).",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40181683,Cognitive Phenotyping and Interpretation of Alzheimer Blood Biomarkers.,"IMPORTANCE: Blood phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) showed good performance in predicting brain amyloidosis. However, the importance of detailed cognitive phenotyping in patients without dementia when interpreting p-tau217 results remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether accuracy, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) in predicting brain amyloidosis using p-tau217 varies across clinical presentations in patients without dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study design included 2 observational, prospective cohort studies: The Cohort of Outpatients From French Research Memory Centers in Order to Improve Knowledge on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (MEMENTO), with enrollment from 2011 to 2014 and 5 years of follow-up, and the Biomarker of Amyloid Peptide and Alzheimer's Disease Risk (BALTAZAR) cohort study, with enrollment from 2010 to 2015 and 3 years of follow-up. Both are multicenter cohorts conducted in French memory clinics. Participants without dementia were included for analysis if they had baseline blood p-tau217 measurement and a known amyloid status through cerebrospinal fluid amyloid β (Aβ)-42/Aβ-40 ratio or positron emission tomography. They presented with either subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with a common Alzheimer disease (AD) phenotype (cAD-MCI: amnestic syndrome of hippocampal type, posterior cortical atrophy, or logopenic primary progressive aphasia), or MCI with uncommon AD or other phenotypes (uAD-MCI). Data were analyzed from May to September 2024.
EXPOSURES: Blood p-tau217 concentrations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brain amyloidosis probabilities were derived from p-tau217 logistic regressions including age, gender, and APOE genotype. Published and internally developed cut points with 90% sensitivity and specificity were used.
RESULTS: A total of 776 participants from the MEMENTO cohort (N = 2323 participants) and 193 participants from the BALTAZAR cohort (N = 1040) were included in this analysis. In the MEMENTO cohort (median [IQR] age, 71 [65-76] years; 444 female [57%]), brain amyloidosis prevalence was 16.5% (20 of 121) in SCI, 45.9% (78 of 170) in cAD-MCI, and 24.5% (119 of 485) in uAD-MCI. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting brain amyloidosis with p-tau217 models was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66-0.89), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95), and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) in the SCI, cAD-MCI, and uAD-MCI subgroups, respectively. External cut points resulted in a PPV of 60.0%, 90.0%, and 74.5% in the SCI, cAD-MCI, and uAD-MCI subgroups, respectively. NPV ranged from 84.2% to 90.2%. With internally developed cut points, PPVs were 52.6%, 84.0%, and 72.3% in the SCI, cAD-MCI, and uAD-MCI subgroups, respectively. NPVs were high (91.7%-94.6%) in all subgroups. Rates of incident dementia strongly increased with the probability of brain amyloidosis in the cAD-MCI subgroup. Replicated analyses in the BALTAZAR cohort provided similar results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results from 2 clinical cohorts suggest that amyloid prevalence varied across cognitive phenotypes and was associated with the diagnostic performance of blood p-tau217 models to determine brain amyloidosis. Comprehensive cognitive phenotyping beyond the basic characterization of SCI, MCI, or dementia should accompany the use of blood biomarkers in clinical practice to avoid misdiagnosis due to false positives.",JAMA Neurol,2025
39801136,Effect of genetic and vascular risk factors on rates of cognitive decline in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have shown that cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with various risk factors, they primarily focused on late-onset AD (LOAD).
OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the differential impact of risk factors on the cognitive decline between early-onset AD (EOAD, onset &lt; 65 years) and LOAD (onset ≥ 65 years) and explore the longitudinal effect of Apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE ε4) on cortical atrophy in both cohorts.
METHODS: Using data from 212 EOAD and 1101 LOAD participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we conducted multivariable mixed-effect models to evaluate the impact of APOE ε4, education, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and body mass index on cognitive performance. Preprocessed MRI data were utilized for longitudinal parametric mapping.
RESULTS: APOE ε4 carriers in both groups showed significantly accelerated declines in language, verbal memory, executive function, and general cognition. By controlling other significant risk factors, APOE ε4 carriers showed faster declines in language and verbal memory in both groups. Females exhibited accelerated declines in Language and verbal memory in the EOAD and LOAD cohorts respectively. LOAD individuals with hypertension showed faster declines while overweight and obese participants displayed slower declines in both cohorts across all domains except visuospatial. Notably, APOE ε4 status was associated with longitudinal cortical atrophy in the LOAD cohort but not in the EOAD cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Known risk factors for AD were associated with cognitive decline in both EOAD and LOAD cohorts.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40037416,Altered spatiotemporal consistency and their genetic mechanisms in mild cognitive impairment: a combined neuroimaging and transcriptome study.,"The Four-dimensional (spatiotemporal) Consistency of local Neural Activities (FOCA) metric was utilized to assess spontaneous whole-brain activity. Despite its application, the genetic underpinnings of FOCA alterations in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remain largely unexplored. To elucidate these changes, we analyzed group FOCA differences in 41 MCI patients and 46 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Integrating the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses to pinpoint genes correlating with MCI-related FOCA changes. We observed heightened FOCA in the frontal-parietal system and diminished FOCA in the temporal lobe and medium cingulate gyrus among MCI patients. These FOCA alterations were spatially linked to the expression of 384 genes, which were enriched in crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex, as well as related pathways. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue and corticothalamic neurons, particularly during late cortical development. They also connected to various behavioral domains. Furthermore, these genes could form a protein-protein interaction network, supported by 34 hub genes. Our results suggest that local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in MCI may stem from the complex interplay of a broad spectrum of genes with diverse functional features.",Cereb Cortex,2025
39932514,Roles of Ubiquitin Ligases and Deubiquitylases in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, composed of phosphorylated Tau protein, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain a mystery. Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) largely contributes to abnormal protein aggregation. A cascade of ubiquitinating enzymes promotes protein ubiquitination, while deubiquitylases (DUBs) regulate its reversal. Disruptions in ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes result in abnormal protein aggregation and the formation of inclusion bodies, ultimately leading to neuronal damage. Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination in the pathogenesis of AD. E3 ubiquitin ligases, which facilitate protein ubiquitination, are beneficial for Aβ clearance, synaptic function, gap junction maintenance, mitophagy, and neuroinflammation. Conversely, DUBs, responsible for removing ubiquitin from substrate proteins, inhibit Aβ and Tau degradation while promoting neuroinflammation in neurons. This review provides a thorough overview of the involvement of E3 ubiquitin ligases and DUBs in AD, highlighting their diverse roles in aspects of pathophysiological processes.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40149001,Decoding microglial immunometabolism: a new frontier in Alzheimer's disease research.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a dynamic interaction between neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation, where microglia play a central role. These immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in response to AD-related pathology, with key genes such as TREM2, APOE, and HIF-1α orchestrating these processes. Microglial metabolism adapts to environmental stimuli, shifting between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Hexokinase-2 facilitates glycolytic flux, while AMPK acts as an energy sensor, coordinating lipid and glucose metabolism. TREM2 and APOE regulate microglial lipid homeostasis, influencing Aβ clearance and immune responses. LPL and ABCA7, both associated with AD risk, modulate lipid processing and cholesterol transport, linking lipid metabolism to neurodegeneration. PPARG further supports lipid metabolism by regulating microglial inflammatory responses. Amino acid metabolism also contributes to microglial function. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase controls the kynurenine pathway, producing neurotoxic metabolites linked to AD pathology. Additionally, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase regulates the pentose phosphate pathway, maintaining redox balance and immune activation. Dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, influenced by genetic variants such as APOE4, impair microglial responses and exacerbate AD progression. Recent findings highlight the interplay between metabolic regulators like REV-ERBα, which modulates lipid metabolism and inflammation, and Syk, which influences immune responses and Aβ clearance. These insights offer promising therapeutic targets, including strategies aimed at HIF-1α modulation, which could restore microglial function depending on disease stage. By integrating metabolic, immune, and genetic factors, this review underscores the importance of microglial immunometabolism in AD. Targeting key metabolic pathways could provide novel therapeutic strategies for mitigating neuroinflammation and restoring microglial function, ultimately paving the way for innovative treatments in neurodegenerative diseases.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39854369,Weight trajectories in aging humanized APOE mice with translational validity to human Alzheimer's risk population: A retrospective analysis.,"Translational validity of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is variable. Because change in weight is a well-documented precursor of AD, we investigated whether diversity of human AD risk weight phenotypes was evident in a longitudinally characterized cohort of 1,196 female and male humanized APOE (hAPOE) mice, monitored up to 28 months of age which is equivalent to 81 human years. Autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) incorporating age, sex, and APOE genotype was employed to identify emergent weight trajectories and phenotypes. In the hAPOE-AD mouse cohort, five distinct weight trajectories emerged: three trajectories were associated with a weight loss phenotype (36% of mice, n = 426), one with weight gain (13% of mice, n = 152), and one trajectory of no change in weight (34% of mice, n = 403). The AHMM model findings were validated with post-hoc survival analyses, revealing differences in survival rates across the five identified phenotypes. Further validation was performed using body composition and plasma β-amyloid data from mice within the identified gain, loss and stable weight trajectories. Weight gain trajectory was associated with elevated plasma β-amyloid levels, higher body fat composition, lower survival rates and a greater proportion of APOE4/4 carriers. In contrast, weight loss was associated with greater proportion of hAPOE3/4 carriers, better survival rates and was predominantly male. The association between weight change and AD risk observed in humans was mirrored in the hAPOE-AD mouse model. Weight trajectories of APOE3/3 mice were equally distributed across weight gain, loss and stability. Surprisingly, despite genetic uniformity, comparable housing, diet and handling, distinct weight trajectories and divergence points emerged for subpopulations. These data are consistent with the heterogeneity observed in the human population for change in body weight during aging and highlight the importance of longitudinal phenotypic characterization of mouse aging to advance the translational validity of preclinical AD mouse models.",PLoS One,2025
39956960,Validation of a novel neuroimaging signature for dementia and clinical Alzheimer's disease in the population-based Rotterdam study.,"BACKGROUND: A novel neuroimaging signature of regional cortical thickness on brain MRI recently showed high potential for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) risk stratification in the community. How these findings translate to other populations, remains undetermined.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to replicate this novel ADRD neuroimaging marker in the population-based Rotterdam Study.
METHODS: We included all participants from the population-based Rotterdam Study with brain-MRI between 2005-2016, and derived the signature using FreeSurfer. We computed hazard ratios and C-statistics for 10-year dementia risk, and betas for cross-sectional associations with cognition, comparing the novel signature to hippocampal volume, mean cortical thickness, and another cortical thickness signature (Dickerson's).
RESULTS: Of 3249 participants (mean age 71.3 ± 8.0 years), 294 developed dementia (74.8% clinical AD) during a mean follow-up of 8.1 years. The novel ADRD signature had similar magnitude of associations as Dickerson's signature and cortical thickness for AD dementia (HR per 1-SD increase 0.87;0.78-0.96), but performed worse than all markers for all-cause dementia. Of the four neuroimaging markers, hippocampal volume showed the strongest associations with both risk of all-cause dementia and clinical AD dementia. The ADRD had the weakest association with general cognitive function (β per 1-SD increase 0.04;0.02-0.06), and executive function (β per 1-SD increase 0.02;0.00-0.04), followed by cortical thickness and Dickerson's, and hippocampal volume showed the strongest associations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based study, the novel cortical thickness signature did not outperform hippocampal volume for dementia risk stratification. The importance of replication studies underlines the value of the current study. Replicating research findings is essential to establish robust biomarkers for dementia risk prediction.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39998851,Impact of the polygenic risk scores for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies indicate a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and elevated risk of dementia. However, the impact of ADHD on cognition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in individuals with cognitive impairment remains unclear.
METHODS: We computed weighted ADHD polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS) in 938 cognitively impaired participants (674 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 264 dementia; mean age 73.5 years). A subset underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau, as well as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET).
RESULTS: We observed lower executive function in individuals with high ADHD-PRS for both MCI and dementia participants. Higher levels of CSF phosphorylated tau, but not Aβ, were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. Increased ADHD-PRS was associated with glucose hypometabolism in the frontal and parietal cortices.
DISCUSSION: ADHD-PRS is associated with a more severe disease presentation in individuals with cognitive impairment due to dementia, characterized by impaired executive function, elevated tau pathology, and hypometabolism in the frontal and parietal cortices.
HIGHLIGHTS: We calculated the genetic liability for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS). Elevated ADHD-PRS was associated with executive function deficits in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau, but not amyloid beta (Aβ), were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with brain hypometabolism in individuals with AD dementia. Hypometabolism in the parietal cortex mediated the effects of ADHD-PRS on executive function.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40119171,A systematic review with a Burden of Proof meta-analysis of health effects of long-term ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure on dementia.,"Previous studies have indicated increased dementia risk associated with fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure; however, the findings are inconsistent. In this systematic review, we assessed the association between long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and dementia outcomes using the Burden of Proof meta-analytic framework, which relaxes log-linear assumptions to better characterize relative risk functions and quantify unexplained between-study heterogeneity (PROSPERO, ID CRD42023421869). Here we report a meta-analysis of 28 longitudinal cohort studies published up to June 2023 that investigated long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and dementia outcomes. We derived risk-outcome scores (ROSs), highly conservative measures of effect size and evidence strength, mapped onto a 1-5-star rating from 'weak and/or inconsistent evidence' to 'very strong and/or consistent evidence'. We identified a significant nonlinear relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and dementia, with a minimum 14% increased risk averaged across PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels between 4.5 and 26.9 µg m<sup>-3</sup> (the 15th to 85th percentile exposure range across included studies), relative to a reference of 2.0 µg m<sup>-3</sup> (n = 49, ROS = 0.13, two stars). We found a significant association of PM<sub>2.5</sub> with Alzheimer's disease (n = 12, ROS = 0.32, three stars) but not with vascular dementia.

39800401,Digital screening tool for the assessment of cognitive impairment in unsupervised setting-digiDEM-SCREEN: study protocol for a validation study.,"INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the most relevant widespread diseases, with a prevalence of currently 55 million people with dementia worldwide. However, about 60-75% of people with dementia have not yet received a formal diagnosis. Asymptomatic screening of cognitive impairments using neuropsychiatric tests has been proven to efficiently enhance diagnosis rates. Digital screening tools, in particular, provide the advantage of being accessible without spatial or time restrictions. The study aims to validate a digital cognitive screening test (digiDEM-SCREEN) as an app in the German language.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre study in Bavaria. Participants are people with mild cognitive impairment, people with dementia in an early stage and cognitively healthy people. Recruitment will take place in specialised diagnostic facilities (memory outpatient clinics). 135 participants are aimed based on a power analysis. Sociodemographic data, diagnosis and results of neuropsychiatric tests (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, digiDEM-SCREEN) will be collected at one point per person via electronic data capturing. The sensitivity, specificity and corresponding cut-off values will be determined based on receiver-operating-characteristic curves. The correlation of the digiDEM-SCREEN test with existing cognitive screening/testing procedures will be analysed.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study obtained ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the Julius-Maximilians-Universität of Würzburg (JMU) (application number: 177/23-sc). The test will give feedback about the current cognitive status and possible cognitive impairments that should lead to the users seeking further diagnostic measures by medical professionals. It will be accessible free of charge in established app stores. The results of the validation study will be published in peer-reviewed journals.",BMJ Open,2025
39962970,Inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase and cGAS/STING repair defects in amyloid-β clearance underlying vascular complications of Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) and its monoclonal antibody therapies are associated with brain vasculitis and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. The naturally-formed epoxides (EpFAs) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as 11,12-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EEQ), are anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution mediators, which are increased by dietary supplementation with ω-3 PUFAs. EpFAs are, however, enzymatically hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in AD patients' macrophages in vivo and in vitro.ObjectiveTo repair amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ) degradation by AD macrophages using the inhibitors of a) soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHIs), termed TPPU and EC5026, together with EpFAs, or b) STING pathway termed H-151.MethodsImmunobiology, immunochemistry, RNA sequencing, and confocal microscopy were used.ResultsIn AD brain (examined postmortem), monocyte/macrophages upload Aβ in plaques and transfer it without degradation into brain microvessels, suffer apoptotis, and release Aβ, inducing vasculitis. The EpFAs of epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EEQ), along with the inhibitors TPPU and H-151, decrease inflammatory cytokines and regulate macrophage unfolded protein response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Treatment of AD macrophages by TPPU with EEQ or by STING inhibitor H-151 increased uploading of Aβ after 2 hours and increased degradation of Aβ after 24 hours.ConclusionsThe sEHI inhibitor EC5026 and the STING inhibitor H-151 increased macrophage uptake and degradation of Aβ. EC5026 administration was safe in normal volunteers. EC5026 together with ω-3 PUFA supplementation are indicated for in a clinical trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40183012,Key motor and non-motor features in early dementia with Lewy bodies.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to characterize early-stage dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) focusing on motor and non-motor symptoms.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study prospectively included newly diagnosed DLB patients within 3 years of cognitive symptom onset. Comparisons were made with individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and motor and non-motor symptoms were assessed using structured interviews and validated scales and questionnaires.
RESULTS: A total of 107 participants were included (23 DLB, 27 PD, 26 AD, and 31 controls). DLB patients (median age 75 years, median disease duration since diagnosis 2 months) commonly reported motor symptoms, including gait disturbances (91.3%), tremor (73.9%), and bradykinesia (87%), with tremor being predominantly unilateral (76.5%) and action-type (52.9%). The most frequent motor subtype was akinetic-rigid (52.2%). Motor symptoms were similar to PD, except for more frequent falls (34.8% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.044) and gait disturbances in DLB patients (91.3% vs. 63%, p = 0.019). Non-motor symptoms, particularly visual hallucinations and neuropsychiatric symptoms were more prevalent in DLB than in PD, while sleep and autonomic symptoms were similar. An abnormal orthostatic test was more frequent in DLB than in PD (45.5% vs. 11.5%, p &lt; 0.008). Compared to AD, all non-motor symptoms were significantly more frequent in DLB. Finally, DLB patients had lower functional independence and quality of life than both PD and AD (p &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Early-stage DLB closely resembles PD in motor symptoms but has more neuropsychiatric non-motor symptoms compared to PD and overall non-motor symptoms than AD.",Front Neurol,2025
39689077,Structure-based virtual screening of Trachyspermum ammi metabolites targeting acetylcholinesterase for Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"In recent decades, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered significant attention due to its rapid global prevalence. The cholinergic hypothesis posits that the degradation of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) contributes to AD development. Despite existing anti-AChE drugs, their adverse side effects necessitate new agents. This study analyzed 150 bioactive phytochemicals from Trachyspermum ammi using structure-based drug design and various in-silico tools to identify potent anti-AChE compounds. Compounds were screened for drug-likeness (QEDw ≥50%) and bioavailability (≥55%) and underwent toxicity profiling via the ProTox-II server. Selected compounds were prepared for molecular docking with the human AChE protein as the receptor. Viridifloral, 2-Methyl-3-glucosyloxy-5-isopropyl phenol, Alpha-Curcumene, and Sterol emerged as top candidates with high AChE affinity. These results were validated by molecular dynamics simulations, confirming stable interactions. The hit compounds were further evaluated for drug-likeness using Lipinski's rule and ADMET properties, confirming favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. DFT optimization analyzed frontier molecular orbitals and electrostatic potential, demonstrating favorable chemical reactivity and stability. This study suggests that these identified compounds could be novel nature-derived AChE inhibitors, potentially contributing to AD treatment. However, further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are necessary to confirm their efficacy in biological systems. Future research will focus on developing these compounds into safe and effective drugs to combat Alzheimer's disease.",PLoS One,2024

METHODS: In a sample of n = 201 participants (63.81 ± 6.04 years, 66.2% female, 65.7% family history of Alzheimer's disease [AD], 38% apolipoprotein E [APOE] ε4+) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, VLM was measured using trials 3 through 5 and delayed recall from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Plasma BDNF was measured using a Human BDNF Quantikine Immunoassay. Mediation analysis used bootstrapping, and stratified mediation models tested the conditional dependence of APOE ε4 carriage.
RESULTS: BDNF partially mediated the sex-VLM relationship (β = -0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.18, -0.01). Female APOE ε4 carriers had higher VLM scores (β = -0.53; p = 0.03), while female non-carriers had both higher BDNF levels (β = -0.68; p &lt; 0.01) and VLM scores (β = -1.06; p &lt; 0.01); BDNF was again a significant mediator (β = -0.18; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.05).
DISCUSSION: This study found that circulating BDNF mediates higher verbal memory scores in females-particularly in APOE ε4 non-carriers.
HIGHLIGHTS: Sex differences in verbal learning and memory (VLM) were mediated by plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.Women exhibited higher VLM scores and plasma BDNF levels compared to men.The protective effect of BDNF in women was attenuated by apolipoprotein E ε4 carriage.Findings suggest sex-specific mechanisms against verbal memory decline in aging.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39868495,Investing in equitable healthy aging: Why Africa must reform social pension schemes to improve Alzheimer's disease and dementia outcomes.,"The eligibility criteria for social pension schemes in Africa hinder equitable and healthy aging. In 2019, women in 14 sub-Saharan African countries had an average life expectancy of 67 years but a healthy life expectancy of only 57 years, leaving them 5 years in poor health before receiving a pension at age 62. Men had a similar situation-a life expectancy of 62 years and a healthy life expectancy of 53 years, spending 10 years in poor health before becoming eligible for pensions at age 63. Many men do not receive pensions due to early death. Delays and low pension payouts contribute to a 2.5% increase in the death rate from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Eligibility criteria for social pension schemes in Africa hinder equitable and healthy aging. Delays and low pension payouts are associated with worsening death rates from dementia. Average health life expectancy for both genders should serve as a basis for initiating pension payouts.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39949405,High-frequency oscillations in epileptic and non-epileptic Alzheimer's disease patients and the differential effect of levetiracetam on the oscillations.,"Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of developing epilepsy together with cognitive decline. Early diagnosis or prediction of parameters associated with epileptic activity can greatly help in managing disease outcomes. Network hyperexcitability is a candidate of interest as a neurophysiological biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. High-frequency oscillations are increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers of hyperexcitability and epileptic activity. However, they have not yet been identified in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we measured high-frequency oscillations via magnetoencephalography recordings in Alzheimer's disease patients with and without epileptic activity, as part of a Phase 2a randomized, double blind clinical trial of the efficacy of levetiracetam to improve cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease. To measure the high-frequency oscillations, we used 10-min magnetoencephalography recordings (275-channel and sampling rate 1200-4000 Hz) during awake resting periods in participants with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls. Recordings from 14 Alzheimer's disease participants, with six having non-epileptic Alzheimer's disease (median age: 60.8, 2 M/4 F), eight having sub-clinical epileptic activity (median age: 54.9, 5 M/3 F) and eight as control (median age: 71, 5 M/3 F), were analysed using two software scripts: Delphos and a custom-made script, for detecting high-frequency oscillations. Levetiracetam 125 mg twice-a-day or placebo was administered for 4 weeks in between two magnetoencephalography recordings, and 4 weeks of washout before switching levetiracetam/placebo phases for each participant. High-frequency oscillations were categorized into ripples (80 to 250 Hz) and fast ripples (250 to 500 Hz). At baseline, Alzheimer's disease participants, both epileptic and non-epileptic had higher rate of ripples and fast ripples than controls in several left/right hemispheric sensor regions (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, compared to epileptic, non-epileptic had higher rate of ripples in left-frontal, left-temporal and cerebral fissure regions and higher rate of fast ripples in left-frontal regions (P &lt; 0.05). In epileptic type, levetiracetam decreased ripples in bilateral-frontal, bilateral-occipital regions and cerebral fissure, whereas in non-epileptic type, levetiracetam increased both ripples and fast ripples in right central and left parietal regions, and ripples in the right parietal region (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, we found hemisphere asymmetry in epileptic type, with right temporal/occipital having more high-frequency oscillations than their counterpart region. Overall, Alzheimer's disease had a high level of high-frequency oscillations, with higher numbers observed in non-epileptic type. Levetiracetam decreased high-frequency oscillations in epileptic but increased high-frequency oscillations in non-epileptic. Thus, high-frequency oscillations can function as a biomarker of hyperexcitability in Alzheimer's disease and may be more pathological when asymmetric and coinciding with presence of epileptic activity. Levetiracetam has the potential for treating hyperactivity in patients with epileptic Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun,2025
39931854,Discovery of Selective β-Secretase (BACE-1) Inhibitors by the Solid-Phase Synthesis of Small Molecular-sized Peptides.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder for which no effective cure currently exists. Research has identified β-Secretase (BACE1) as a promising therapeutic target for the management of AD. BACE1 is involved in the rate-limiting step and produces toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides that lead to deposits in the form of amyloid plaques extracellularly, resulting in AD.
METHOD: In this connection, 60 small peptides were evaluated for their in-silico studies to predict the bonding orientation with BACE1. Next, 5 peptides (12, 20, 21, 51, and 52) were selected based on high scoring of Vander Waal interactions with the catalytic site of the enzyme.
RESULTS: The identified hit peptides were synthesized using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) elucidated their structures and 1 1 HNMR spectroscopy. According to their In-vitro BACE1 inhibitory study, peptides 21 having high Vander Waal forces showed significant BACE1 inhibition with IC50 = 4.64 ± 0.1μM). Moreover, the kinetic study revealed that peptide 21 is a mixed-type inhibitor and can interact at the active site and the allosteric site of BACE1.
CONCLUSION: According to the cytotoxicity study, peptide 21 was found to be noncytotoxic at 4.64 μM, 10 μM and 20 μM. The forthcoming target of this study is to evaluate further the effect of peptide 21 in an in-vivo mice model.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
40008330,Neurovascular phase coherence is altered in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia, but its cause still remains elusive. It is characterized by neurodegeneration, with amyloid-beta and tau aggregation. Recently, however, the roles of the vasculature and the neurovascular unit are being highlighted as important for disease progression. In particular, there is reduced microvascular density, and altered gene expression in vascular and glial cells. Structural changes naturally impact the functioning of the neurovascular unit, and the goal of the study was to quantify the corresponding changes in vivo, non-invasively. Our assessment is based on recordings of brain oxygenation, neuronal and cardiorespiratory activities, captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram and respiration effort, respectively. Two groups were compared: an Alzheimer's disease group (N = 19) and a control group (N = 20) of similar age. The time-series were analysed using methods that can capture multi-scale and time-varying oscillations such as the wavelet transform power and wavelet phase coherence. The Alzheimer's disease group shows a significant decrease in the power of brain oxygenation oscillations compared to the control group. There is also a significant global reduction in the phase coherence between brain oxygenation time-series. The neurovascular phase coherence around 0.1 Hz is also significantly reduced in the Alzheimer's disease group. In addition, the average respiration rate is increased in the Alzheimer's disease group compared to the control group. We show that the phase coherence between vascular and neuronal activities is reduced in Alzheimer's disease compared to the control group, indicating altered functioning of the neurovascular unit. The brain oxygenation dynamics reveals reduced power and coordination of oscillations, especially in frequency ranges that are associated with vasomotion. This could lead to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, which could affect ATP production, and potentially reduce amyloid-beta clearance. These changes in neurovascular dynamics have potential for early diagnosis, as a marker of disease progression, and for evaluating the effect of interventions.",Brain Commun,2025
40016812,"Identification and characterization of variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes in Chinese patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.","Variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP are major genetic causes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Our study aimed to identify the genotypic and phenotypic spectrums in a Chinese EOAD cohort and confirm their pathogenicity by functional analysis. This study included 304 unrelated clinically diagnosed EOAD participants of Chinese Han ancestry. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that 26 out of 304 individuals (8.6%) carried rare variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, including 16 in PSEN1 (5.3%), 6 in PSEN2 (2.0%), and 4 in APP (1.3%). Eight variants were novel, including PSEN1 p.Q56R, PSEN1 p.L174P, PSEN1 p.S289P, PSEN1 p.Y466C, PSEN2 p.R17W, PSEN2 p.F331Y, APP p.D197N, and APP p.D252V. Functional study revealed that the PS1 L174P, S289P, R377M, Y466C, PS2 V214L, and M239T mutants increased Aβ42 levels and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios. The PS1 L174P, R377M, and Y466C mutants decreased the maturation of presenilin-1. Our findings highlight the prevalence and pathogenic significance of APP /PSENs variants in a Chinese EOAD cohort and expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of EOAD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40175437,Loneliness and biomarkers of brain pathology in people with subjective cognitive decline.,"Loneliness is a neuropsychiatric symptom that has been associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. We aimed to investigate whether depressive symptomatology and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) are associated with loneliness. Secondly, we aimed to investigate whether loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and biomarkers of AD and CVD are associated with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). We included 215 cognitively unimpaired participants (70 y/o) with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging, and questionnaires for loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and SCD. For aim 1, our findings showed that CVD and depressive symptomatology were the most relevant measures to discriminate people with loneliness. For aim 2, a random forest classification model showed that loneliness contributed to discriminate individuals with SCD, but logistic regression showed that its partial predictive effect was non-significant when depressive symptomatology and AD biomarkers were included in the models. We conclude that loneliness is associated with SCD, CVD, and depressive symptomatology. Given the complex interplay between loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and SCD, more research is needed to fully clarify the unique role of each neuropsychiatric symptom in relation to biomarkers of brain pathology.",Sci Rep,2025
40018359,Research progress on brain network imaging biomarkers of subjective cognitive decline.,"PURPOSE: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an early manifestation of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, and accurately diagnosing SCD to differentiate it from neurotypical aging in older adults is a common challenge for researchers.
METHODS: This review examines and summarizes relevant studies regarding the neuroimaging of the AD continuum, and comprehensively summarizes and outlines the SCD clinical features characterizing along with the corresponding neuroimaging changes involving structural, functional, and metabolic networks.
RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of SCD include a subjective decline in self-perceived cognitive function, and there are significant imaging changes, such as reductions in gray matter volume in certain brain regions, abnormalities in the integrity of white matter tracts and diffusion metrics, alterations in functional connectivity between different sub-networks or within networks, as well as abnormalities in brain metabolic networks and cerebral blood flow perfusion.
CONCLUSION: The 147 referenced studies in this paper indicate that exploring the structural, functional, and metabolic network changes in the brain related to SCD through neuroimaging aims to enhance the goals and mission of brain science development programs: ""Understanding the Brain,"" ""Protecting the Brain,"" and ""Creating the Brain,"" thereby strengthening researchers' investigation into the mechanisms of brain function. Early diagnosis of SCD, along with prompt intervention, can reduce the incidence of AD spectrum while improving patients' quality of life, even integrating numerous scientific research achievements into unified and established standards and applying them in clinical practice by doctors, thus all encouraging researchers to further investigate SCD issues in older adults.",Front Neurosci,2025
40193741,Integrated Genomic and Proteomic Drug Target Discovery for Vascular Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (P3-3.015).,"OBJECTIVE: To utilize a comprehensive multi-omic approach to identify novel drug targets that mediate the genetic risk of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
BACKGROUND: VaD and AD are major detriments of brain health with significant genetic risk components. Current prevention strategies focus on risk factor control but integrating genomic and proteomic data could uncover key molecular targets for more effective treatments based on genetic insights.
DESIGN/METHODS: We analyzed genomic and proteomic data from 53,014 UK Biobank participants. Using genome-wide association data for both dementia forms, we deployed four analytical steps (all corrected for multiple testing): (1) linear regression between polygenic risk scores (PRS) and 2,923 standardized protein levels measured at baseline, adjusted for age, sex, and genetic principal components; (2) association between selected proteins and dementia; (3) Mendelian Randomization to assess causality for the proteins from (1+2); and (4) mediation to quantify the intermediary role of causal proteins in the PRS-dementia relationship.
RESULTS: Our analyses revealed several proteins that causally mediate the association between polygenic risk and dementia. In VaD, we discovered 3 mediating proteins involved in neuronal differentiation and signaling (PALM, NEFL, CEND1, 2-3% mediated effect). For AD, five proteins showed significant mediation, the strongest effect seen in APOE (lipid transport, 10% mediated effect) and MENT (chromatin regulation, 5% mediated effect) confirming their known roles in neurodegenerative processes. Other proteins (PVR, LGMN, ERBB3, MZB1) are involved in cell adhesion, immune response, protein degradation, and signal transduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-omic approach successfully identified several novel proteins and pathways involved in VaD and AD, revealing key pathways and therapeutic targets. While some proteins (APOE, ERBB3) are addressed by developing or existing drugs, others lack direct pharmacological targeting, highlighting opportunities for drug discovery and validation in prevention and treatment of dementia.

39732507,Longitudinal synaptic loss versus tau Braak staging in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: The longitudinal progression of synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how it is affected by tau pathology remains poorly understood.
METHODS: Thirty patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 26 healthy controls underwent cognitive evaluations and tau, synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), and amyloid positron emission tomography. Twenty-one aMCI underwent 2-year follow-up (FU) investigations.
RESULTS: Tau levels in aMCI increased longitudinally in Braak regions III through VI but not in Braak regions I and II. SV2A decreased longitudinally in all Braak regions in aMCI. Baseline tau was negatively associated with longitudinal SV2A loss in early Braak regions and with SV2A at FU across regions. Baseline tau and longitudinal change in SV2A were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: Tau accumulation reaches a plateau in early Braak regions already in the aMCI stage of AD. In early Braak regions, the association between baseline tau and longitudinal SV2A loss might reflect synaptic dysfunction caused by tau pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau accumulation reached a plateau in early Braak regions in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. aMCI patients show widespread longitudinal decrease in synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) over 2 years. Baseline tau was predictive for longitudinal SV2A loss. The tau-SV2A relation showed individual variability and was negative across patients. Baseline tau and longitudinal SV2A change were associated with change in cognition.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39920421,Searching for the cellular underpinnings of the selective vulnerability to tauopathic insults in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease exhibit pathological changes in the brain that proceed in a stereotyped and regionally specific fashion. However, the cellular underpinnings of regional vulnerability are poorly understood, in part because whole-brain maps of a comprehensive collection of cell types have been inaccessible. Here, we deployed a recent cell-type mapping pipeline, Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS), to determine the brain-wide distributions of pan-hippocampal and neocortical cells in the mouse, and then used these maps to identify general principles of cell-type-based selective vulnerability in PS19 mouse models. We found that hippocampal glutamatergic neurons as a whole were significantly positively associated with regional tau deposition, suggesting vulnerability, while cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were negatively associated. We also identified oligodendrocytes as the single-most strongly negatively associated cell type. Further, cell-type distributions were more predictive of end-time-point tau pathology than AD-risk-gene expression. Using gene ontology analysis, we found that the genes that are directly correlated to tau pathology are functionally distinct from those that constitutively embody the vulnerable cells. In short, we have elucidated cell-type correlates of tau deposition across mouse models of tauopathy, advancing our understanding of selective cellular vulnerability at a whole-brain level.",Commun Biol,2025
40193903,Perivascular Tau in Autopsy Cases with Definite Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (P10-3.007).,"OBJECTIVE: The main aims of this study were to quantify the burden of tau-pathology in an autopsy cohort of clinical cases with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and to characterize the presence of perivascular tau (PVT) accumulation and its relationship with CAA.
BACKGROUND: CAA and Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathological Changes, such as tau-tangles, often coexist. The role of tau pathology in the pathophysiology of CAA remains to be determined.
DESIGN/METHODS: Autopsy cases with a neuropathologically confirmed clinical diagnosis of CAA were evaluated. Samples were taken from cortical areas and underwent immunohistochemistry against amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (At8). Deep-learning based models were created and applied to the samples to quantify 1) density of intraneuronal tau-tangles; 2) percentage area of cortical CAA and Aβ-plaques using the Aiforia® platform; 3) percentage area of total cortical tau-burden, using QuPath. Linear-mixed effects models were applied to assess the association between tau and CAA burden. The presence of dyshoric CAA (flamelike Aβ deposits that radiate into the perivascular neuropil), and PVT (accentuated accumulation of tau around the vessel) were visually identified on Aβ vs. At8-stained sections respectively. Single-vessel analysis was performed to determine whether there was an association between PVT and CAA using Chi-square tests.
RESULTS: A total of 76 sections in 19 CAA cases (median age-at-death 76 years [64-88]; 7 females) were analyzed. Higher tau-tangles and total tau-burden were observed in the temporal cortex versus the occipital cortex (p=0.05). CAA burden was not associated with tau-tangles or total tau-burden. Dyshoric CAA was observed around at least one vessel in 71 (93.4%) of the sections and PVT in 32 (34%) of the sections. In single-vessel analysis, PVT was significantly associated with both dyshoric CAA (p=0.004) and any CAA (p=0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: Tau was not regionally associated with CAA in this autopsy-cohort. Accumulation of PVT was significantly associated with CAA in the single-vessel analysis.

39741000,Acute Communication Between Microglia and Nonparenchymal Immune Cells in the Anti-Aβ Antibody-Injected Cortex.,"Anti-Aβ immunotherapy use to treat Alzheimer's disease is on the rise. While anti-Aβ antibodies provide hope in targeting Aβ plaques in the brain, there still remains a lack of understanding regarding the cellular responses to these antibodies in the brain. In this study, we sought to identify the acute effects of anti-Aβ antibodies on immune responses. To determine cellular changes due to anti-Aβ antibody exposure, we intracranially injected 14 mo APP male and female mice with anti-Aβ IgG1 (6E10) or control IgG1 into the cortex. After 24 h or 3 d, we harvested the cortex and performed a glial cell-enriched preparation for single-cell sequencing. Cell types, proportions, and cell-to-cell signaling were evaluated between the two injection conditions and two acute timepoints. We identified 23 unique cell clusters including microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, oligos/OPCs, immune cells, and unknown. The anti-Aβ antibody-injected cortices revealed more ligand-receptor (L-R) communications between cell types, as well as stronger communications at only 24 h. At 3 d, while there were more L-R communications for the anti-Aβ antibody condition, the strength of these connections was stronger in the control IgG condition. We also found evidence of an initial and strong communication emphasis in microglia-to-nonparenchymal immune cells at 24 h, specifically in the TGFβ signaling pathway. We identify several pathways that are specific to anti-Aβ antibody exposure at acute timepoints. These data lay the groundwork for understanding the brain's unique response to anti-Aβ antibodies.",J Neurosci,2025
39865978,Dancing towards speech improvement: Repurposing dance for motor speech deficits in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Dance or rhythmic movement-based training has demonstrated significant efficacy in addressing a range of motor and cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Leveraging both human and non-human animal behavioral and neurobiological evidence, I hypothesize a possible untapped role of dance training in mitigating impairments in the motor control of speech, a complex sensorimotor behavior affected in these conditions. Here, this hypothesis is supported by an in-depth examination of motor speech deficits in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, at a behavioral, physiological, and neural level. Additionally, literature on the impact of dance training on behaviors and brain pathways possibly relevant to speech motor control in populations with neurodegenerative diseases is thoroughly reviewed. Synthesizing these findings, I propose repurposing dance as a novel treatment for motor speech deficits and outline specific experiments to test this hypothesis. By comprehensively investigating the full spectrum of the effects of a motor-based training, i.e., dance, on often overlooked motor-based behaviors, such as speech, we may uncover novel therapeutic avenues of a practice that has already shown promising implications.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39708240,Memantine/Rosuvastatin Therapy Abrogates Cognitive and Hippocampal Injury in an Experimental Model of Alzheimer's Disease in Rats: Role of TGF-β1/Smad Signaling Pathway and Amyloid-β Clearance.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder of complex pathogenesis and multiple interacting signaling pathways where amyloidal-β protein (Aβ) clearance plays a crucial role in cognitive decline. Herein, the current study investigated the possible modulatory effects of memantine/ rosuvastatin therapy on TGF-β1/p-Smad/p21 signaling pathway and their correlation to the blood brain barrier transporters involved in Aβ-clearance and microRNAs as a novel molecular mechanism in AD treatment. AD was induced by a single intracerebroventricular streptozotocin injection (ICV-STZ, 3 mg/kg) in rats and drug therapy was continued for 28 days after AD induction. Efficacy was monitored by applying a battery of behavioral assessments, as well as biochemical, histopathological, molecular and gene expression techniques. The upregulated TGF-β1-signaling in the untreated rats was found to be highly correlated to transporters and microRNAs governing Aβ-efflux; ABCA1/miRNA-26 and LRP1/miRNA-205 expressions, rather than RAGE/miRNA-185 controlling Aβ-influx; an effect that was opposed by the tested drugs and was found to be correlated with the abolished TGF-β1-signaling as well. Combined memantine/rosuvastatin therapy ameliorated the STZ evoked decreases in escape latency and number of crossovers in the Morris water maze test, % spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test, and discrimination and recognition indices in the object recognition test. The evoked behavioral responses were directly related to the β-amyloid accumulation and the alteration in its clearance. Additionally, drug treatment increased brain glutathione and decreased malondialdehyde levels. These findings were histopathologically confirmed by a marked reduction of gliosis and restoration of neuronal integrity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the AD rats. These findings implicated that the memantine/rosuvastatin combination could offer a new therapeutic potential for AD management by abrogating the TGF-β1/p-Smad2/p21 pathway and regulating Aβ-clearance.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2024
39688618,Amyloid-β oligomers increase the binding and internalization of tau oligomers in human synapses.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the propagation and spreading of CNS tau pathology closely correlates with cognitive decline, positioning tau as an attractive therapeutic target. Amyloid beta (Aβ) has been strongly implicated in driving tau spread, whereas primary tauopathies such as primary age-related tauopathy (PART)-which lack Aβ pathology-exhibit limited tau spread and minimal-to-no cognitive decline. Emerging evidence converges on a trans-synaptic mechanism of tau spread, facilitated by the transfer of misfolded tau aggregates (e.g. soluble oligomers). However, it is unclear whether Aβ oligomers modulate the binding and internalization of tau oligomers in human synapses. Our translationally focused paradigms utilize post-mortem brain specimens from Control, PART, and AD patients. Synaptosomes isolated from the temporal cortex of all three groups were incubated with preformed recombinant tauO (rtauO), ± preformed recombinant AβO (rAβO), and oligomer binding/internalization was quantified via flow cytometry following proteinase K (PK) digestion of surface-bound oligomers. TauO-synapse interactions were visualized using EM immunogold. Brain-derived tau oligomers (BDTO) from AD and PART PBS-soluble hippocampal fractions were co-immunoprecipitated and analyzed via mass spectrometry to compare synaptic tauO interactomes in primary and secondary tauopathies, thereby inferring the role of Aβ. AD synaptosomes, enriched in endogenous Aβ pathology, exhibited increased rtauO internalization compared to PART synaptosomes. This observation was mirrored in Control synaptosomes, where recombinant rAβO significantly increased rtauO binding and internalization. PK pre-treatment abolished this effect, implicating synaptic membrane proteins in AβO-mediated tauO internalization. While both PART and AD BDTO were broadly enriched in synaptic proteins, AD BDTO exhibited differential enrichment of endocytic proteins across pre- and post-synaptic compartments, whereas PART BDTO showed no significant synaptic enrichment. This study demonstrates that Aβ oligomers enhance tau oligomer binding and drive its internalization through synaptic membrane proteins. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights underlying pathological tau spreading directly within human synapses and emphasize the therapeutic potential of targeting Aβ-tau interactions.",Acta Neuropathol,2024
40179995,miRNA and piRNA differential expression profiles in Alzheimer's disease: A potential source of pathology and tool for diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and despite our best efforts and recent advancements, a treatment that stops or substantially slows its progression has remained elusive. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), hold the potential to alleviate some of the common issues in the field by serving to better differentiate AD and non-AD individuals. These vesicles could provide insights into therapeutic targets, and potentially an avenue towards early detection. We compared the sEV cargo profiles of AD and non-AD brains (n = 6) and identified significant differences in both the micro RNA (miRNA) and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) cargo through sEV isolation from temporal cortex tissue, followed by small RNA sequencing, and differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs targeting systems relevant to AD included miR-206, miR-4516, miR-219a-5p, and miR-486-5p. Significant piRNAs included piR-6,565,525, piR-2,947,194, piR-7,181,973, and piR-7,326,987. These targets warrant further study for their potential role in the progression of AD pathology by dysregulating cellular activity; additionally, future large-scale studies of neuronal sEV miRNA profiles may facilitate the development of diagnostic tools which can aid in clinical trial design and recruitment. Longitudinal analysis of sEV data, perhaps accessible through plasma surveyance, will help determine at what point these miRNA and/or piRNA profiles begin to diverge between AD and non-AD individuals.",Exp Gerontol,2025
39711458,A whole-brain functional connectivity model of Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two proteinopathies, amyloid and tau, which have a cascading effect on the functional and structural organization of the brain.
METHODS: In this study, we used a supervised machine learning technique to build a model of functional connections that predicts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> (the PATH-fc model). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 289 older adults in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were utilized for this model.
RESULTS: We successfully derived the PATH-fc model to predict the ratio of p-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> as well as cognitive functioning in older adults across the spectrum of healthy and pathological aging. However, the in-sample fit magnitude was low, indicating a need for further model development.
DISCUSSION: Our pathology-based model of functional connectivity included representation from multiple canonical networks of the brain with intra-network connectivity associated with low pathology and inter-network connectivity associated with higher levels of pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Whole-brain functional connectivity model (PATH-fc) is linked to AD pathophysiology. The PATH-fc model predicts performance in multiple domains of cognitive functioning. The PATH-fc model is a distributed model including representation from all canonical networks.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40000575,Role of Peripheral NLRP3 Inflammasome in Cognitive Impairments: Insights of Non-central Factors.,"Cognitive impairments are common clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases. Emerging evidence has suggested a strong correlation between peripheral chronic inflammation and cognitive impairments. For example, nearly 40% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease also suffer from cognitive impairments. In this condition, NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3-I) generating pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β serves as a significant effector, and its persistence exerts adverse effects to both periphery and the brain. Moreover, investigations on serum biomarkers of mild cognitive impairments have shown NLRP3-I components' upregulation, suggesting the involvement of peripheral inflammasome pathway in this disorder. Here, we systematically reviewed the current knowledge of NLRP3-I in inflammatory disease to uncover its potential role in bridging peripheral chronic inflammation and cognitive impairments. This review summarizes the molecular features and ignition process of NLRP3-I in inflammatory response. Meanwhile, various effects of NLRP3-I involved in peripheral inflammation-associated disease are also reviewed, especially its chronic disturbances to brain homeostasis and cognitive function through routes including gut-brain, liver-brain, and kidney-brain axes. In addition, current promising compounds and their targets relative to NLRP3-I are discussed in the context of cognitive impairments. Through the detailed investigation, this review highlights the critical role of peripheral NLRP3-I in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders, and offers novel perspectives for developing effective therapeutic interventions for diseases associated with cognitive impairments. The present review outlines the current knowledge on the ignition of NLRP3-I in inflammatory disease and more importantly, emphasizes the role of peripheral NLRP3-I as a causal pathway in the development of cognitive disorders. Although major efforts to restrain cognitive decline are mainly focused on the central nervous system, it has become clear that disturbances from peripheral immune are closely associated with the dysfunctional brain. Therefore, attenuation of these inflammatory changes through inhibiting the NLRP3-I pathway in early inflammatory disease may reduce future risk of cognitive impairments, and in the meantime, considerations on such pathogenesis for combined drug therapy will be required in the clinical evaluation of cognitive disorders.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39749010,Clearance of beta-amyloid and tau aggregates is size dependent and altered by an inflammatory challenge.,"Extracellular beta-amyloid aggregation and inflammation are in a complex and not fully understood interplay during hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our group has previously shown that an immune challenge with tumour necrosis factor alpha can alter extracellular beta-sheet containing aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons carrying familial Alzheimer's disease-related presenilin 1 mutations. Here, using single-molecule detection and super-resolution imaging techniques, we quantified and characterized the intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and AT8-positive tau aggregates. Our results indicate a pre-existing Alzheimer's disease-like pathology caused by the presenilin 1 mutation, with increased beta-amyloid aggregates in both the cell lysate and conditioned media compared to isogenic controls and also increased intracellular tau aggregates. The main effect of tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment on presenilin 1 neurons was the formation of larger intracellular beta-amyloid aggregates. In contrast, isogenic controls showed more significant changes with tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment with an increase in beta-amyloid aggregates in the media but not intracellularly and an increase in tau aggregates in both the media and cell lysate, suggesting a chronic inflammation-driven mechanism for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Remarkably, we also found significant morphological differences between intra- and extracellular beta-amyloid and tau aggregates in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons, suggesting these neurons can only clear aggregates when small, and that larger aggregates stay inside the neurons. While majority of the beta-amyloid aggregates were cleared into the media, a greater portion of the tau aggregates remained intracellular. This size-dependent aggregate clearance was also shown to be conserved in vivo, using soaked and homogenized mouse and human post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain samples. As such, our results are proposing a previously unknown, size-dependent aggregate clearance mechanism, which can possibly explain the intracellular aggregation of tau and extracellular aggregation of beta-amyloid.",Brain Commun,2025
40165251,Immune modulation to treat Alzheimer's disease.,"Immune mechanisms play a fundamental role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, suggesting that approaches which target immune cells and immunologically relevant molecules can offer therapeutic opportunities beyond the recently approved amyloid beta monoclonal therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of immunomodulatory therapeutics in development, including their preclinical evidence and clinical trial results. Along with detailing immune processes involved in AD pathogenesis and highlighting how these mechanisms can be therapeutically targeted to modify disease progression, we summarize knowledge gained from previous trials of immune-based interventions, and provide a series of recommendations for the development of future immunomodulatory therapeutics to treat AD.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40065918,Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.,"UNLABELLED: The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine treatment benefit in clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: MCID is a key measure of within-person change in cognition, function, or behavior when it is applied to metrics of Alzheimer's disease progression.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID or minimum within person change (MWPC) can function as useful means of determining if a patient has progressed to thresholds of detectable change.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID/MWPC can be used to determine the number or percent of individuals who have progressed to detectable levels of within-person change, with differences anticipated in active treatment and placebo groups.MCID/MWPC are not measures that are appropriately applied to group outcomes of clinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39766440,Assessing the Relationship of Brain Metabolites to Cortical Thickness and Dementia Symptoms in Adults with Down Syndrome: A Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Those with the genetic disorder Down syndrome are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Previous work shows group differences in magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite measures in adults with Down syndrome who have Alzheimer's disease-related dementia compared to those who do not. In this pilot study, we assess relationships between metabolites and measures related to dementia status in a sample of adults with Down syndrome.
METHODS: Seventeen adults with Down syndrome were scanned using a 3 tesla MRI scanner. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans focused on the hippocampus and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Metabolites of interest, including myo-inositol and N-acetyl-aspartate, were correlated with scores on the Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities, cortical thickness, and a measure of cognitive ability. In addition, cortical thickness was compared to an age- and sex-matched cohort of 17 previously scanned adults without Down syndrome.
RESULTS: Metabolite measures were not significantly related to cognitive/behavioral measures or to cortical thickness in this small cohort. Participants with Down syndrome showed widespread increases in cortical thickness compared to controls, even after accounting for potential differences in grey matter/white matter contrast.
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite values were not related to two continuous measures that have previously been associated with dementia status in those with Down syndrome.",Brain Sci,2024
39711266,"Differential associations of neighborhood disadvantage, race/ethnicity, and cognitive status with experiences of psychosocial distress in the HABS-HD cohort.","INTRODUCTION: Understanding how contextual socioeconomic factors are associated with psychosocial distress among different ethnoracial groups is important for addressing health disparities in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Using Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD) data collected between 2017 and 2023, we examined the association of neighborhood disadvantage with psychosocial distress using demographically adjusted linear regression models, stratified by ethnoracial group and cognitive status.
RESULTS: We included 630 non-Hispanic Black, 1109 Hispanic, and 1068 non-Hispanic White older adults deemed cognitively normal (CN) or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Residing in areas of greater neighborhood disadvantage was associated with increased chronic stress (CS) among CN White participants, but this relationship was attenuated among White participants with MCI. Regardless of cognitive status, severe levels of disadvantage were associated with increased CS and depression among Black participants.
DISCUSSION: Aging in more disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with greater CS and depression for Black and White participants.
HIGHLIGHTS: Greater neighborhood disadvantage was associated with increased depression and chronic stress for White and Black individuals. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment reported greater levels of psychosocial distress. These findings are relevant for addressing mental health inequity in aging populations.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39865689,Survival disparities among Alzheimer's disease patients in Hawaii.,"BackgroundSurvival after an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is vital for patients, their families, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Hawaii, known for its diverse ethnic population, exhibits significant racial health disparities.ObjectiveThis study examined racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in AD survival in Hawaii and developed machine learning models to predict overall survival using Hawaii Medicare data.MethodsNine years of Hawaii Medicare data were utilized to gather information on AD development after age 65, following patients to capture all-cause survival or until censoring. The study examined the effects of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) on mortality risk. Cox regression analysis was conducted on overall survival, accounting for covariates. A Survival Random Forest was employed to model survival, incorporating K years of longitudinal health profiles.ResultsThe study included 9393 AD subjects. Analysis revealed that Asian Americans (AA) had a later age at AD diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), with an average age of 85.9, compared to 82.7 and 83.3 years for whites and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI), respectively. Low SES showed a marginal increase in hazard (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.36, p &lt; 0.001). After covariate adjustment, compared to AAs with better SES, increased hazards were found for their white counterpart (HR = 1.18, p &lt; 0.001) and groups with low SES: AA (HR = 1.28, p &lt; 0.001), white (HR = 1.51, p &lt; 0.001), and NHPI (HR = 1.39, p &lt; 0.001). The predictive model had a Concordance-Index of 0.82, showing reasonable predictability.ConclusionsRacial/ethnic and SES disparities significantly influence AD onset and survival. Combined with longitudinal health status data, machine learning demonstrates reasonable predictability of survival.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39827337,Chitinase-3-like-1: a multifaceted player in neuroinflammation and degenerative pathologies with therapeutic implications.,"Chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein involved in key biological processes, including tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and neuroinflammation. It has emerged as a significant player in various neurodegenerative diseases and brain disorders. Elevated CHI3L1 levels have been observed in neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), HIV-associated dementia (HAD), Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS), and brain tumors. This review explores the role of CHI3L1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders, with a focus on its contributions to neuroinflammation, immune cell infiltration, and neuronal degeneration. As a key regulator of neuroinflammation, CHI3L1 modulates microglia and astrocyte activity, driving the release of proinflammatory cytokines that exacerbate disease progression. In addition to its role in disease pathology, CHI3L1 has emerged as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of brain disorders. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CHI3L1 have been linked to disease severity and cognitive decline, particularly in AD and MS, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies targeting CHI3L1, such as small-molecule inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies, have shown promise in preclinical studies, demonstrating reduced neuroinflammation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and improved neuronal survival. Despite its therapeutic potential, challenges remain in developing selective and safe CHI3L1-targeted therapies, particularly in ensuring effective delivery across the blood-brain barrier and mitigating off-target effects. This review addresses the complexities of targeting CHI3L1, highlights its potential in precision medicine, and outlines future research directions aimed at unlocking its full therapeutic potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases and brain pathologies.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39753773,Analysis of multi-condition single-cell data with latent embedding multivariate regression.,"Identifying gene expression differences in heterogeneous tissues across conditions is a fundamental biological task, enabled by multi-condition single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Current data analysis approaches divide the constituent cells into clusters meant to represent cell types, but such discrete categorization tends to be an unsatisfactory model of the underlying biology. Here, we introduce latent embedding multivariate regression (LEMUR), a model that operates without, or before, commitment to discrete categorization. LEMUR (1) integrates data from different conditions, (2) predicts each cell's gene expression changes as a function of the conditions and its position in latent space and (3) for each gene, identifies a compact neighborhood of cells with consistent differential expression. We apply LEMUR to cancer, zebrafish development and spatial gradients in Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating its broad applicability.",Nat Genet,2025
39999809,Deciphering Perspectives: A European Survey on Clinical Decision Support Tools for Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Technological advancements like digital monitoring tools, disease-modifying therapies, and artificial intelligence have been shown to improve the clinical management of neurocognitive diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enhance implementation in daily practice, users' input is essential in the technology development process. This study aimed to determine clinician's perspective of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in the management of dementia and AD.
METHOD: A survey was conducted targeting clinicians practicing in the field of dementia across Europe. A sixty-five-item digital questionnaire was administered, and opinions were inquired across the domains of diagnosis, disease-modifying therapy, and prognosis, including factors that affect tool implementation and utilization.
RESULTS: Eighty-four clinicians (including specialist physicians, psychologists, and nurses) responded to this survey, and more than 50% had no knowledge or experience with CDSS. Most of the respondents reported the ability to predict the likelihood of AD as the most important diagnostic function. It was surprising to find the middling responses for the ability to predict amyloid positivity. The majority indicated assessment of treatment eligibility for disease-modifying therapy as vital, and the ability to predict cognitive and functional decline as the most important prognostic functions. Data accuracy and ease of use were noted as most necessary to facilitate CDSS adoption and implementation.
CONCLUSION: Findings from this study contribute to the future development of CDSS in this field, especially regarding the approval and imminent use of disease-modifying therapies, a comprehensive tool that is precise and user friendly would improve clinical decisions and efficiency.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,2025
40134937,Elevated TDP-43 serum levels associated with postoperative delirium following major cardiac surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a recurring complication among vulnerable patients undergoing major cardiac surgery. While delirium has been associated with prodromal dementia, there is minimal evidence to support the causality of this nuanced relationship. Clarification as to how postoperative delirium might lead to neurodegenerative dementias, perhaps through evidence of contemporaneous biomarkers, would heighten the plausibility of a causal correlation. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a nuclear protein essential for transcriptional events, has been linked to pathological aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).
METHODS: Circulating TDP-43 levels in cardiac surgical patients aged 60 years and older were evaluated in a biobank derived from the Minimizing ICU Neurological Dysfunction with Dexmedetomidine-induced Sleep (MINDDS) clinical trial. Serum total TDP-43 levels, measured with a single molecule array (Simoa), were compared across preoperative and postoperative day one timepoints according to delirium status assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). To investigate the temporal changes in serum TDP-43, an independent validation cohort of 25 patients aged 60 years and older undergoing major cardiac surgery was analyzed.
RESULTS: Total serum TDP-43 levels increased by 16.5% (95% CI: 5.9%-27.9%, p = 0.0021) on postoperative day one compared to baseline levels. This increase was more pronounced in patients who experienced delirium (median increase of 55.1%, 95% CI: 22.9%-96.4%, p = 0.0002). Further, these findings were conserved in multiple logistic regression models adjusting for treatment, age, sex, and baseline cognitive scores. In the validation cohort, TDP-43 levels were found to be significantly elevated immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass from the baseline, with a gradual decrease by postoperative day one.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that post-cardiac surgery delirium among vulnerable patients is associated with significant elevations in circulating TDP-43. This relationship suggests that TDP-43 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for acute neurological insults and blood-brain barrier integrity following cardiac surgery. Overall, our results provide mechanistic insights into the inter-relationship between postoperative delirium and subsequent cognitive impairment, potentially offering new avenues for early intervention in at-risk surgical patients.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2025
40138406,Activity-dependent regulation of Cdc42 by Ephexin5 drives synapse growth and stabilization.,"Synaptic Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) play vital roles in regulating the activity-dependent neuronal plasticity that is critical for learning. Ephexin5, a RhoGEF implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and Angelman syndrome, was originally reported in neurons as a RhoA-specific GEF that negatively regulates spine synapse density. Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5's role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning.",Sci Adv,2025
39813771,Brain mechanical properties predict longitudinal cognitive change in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Age-related cognitive decline is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various neurobiological processes at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. The extent of this decline varies between individuals and the underlying determinants of these differences are not fully understood. Two of the most prominent signs of cognitive decline in aging are the deterioration of episodic memory, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the nearly always accompanying atrophy of the medial temporal lobe. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have consistently demonstrated the strong relationship between these two, however, recent advanced imaging techniques have shown promise for predicting cognitive decline earlier than atrophy measures. In this study, we investigate the value of brain biomechanical properties, specifically in the medial temporal lobe, for predicting global cognitive decline along the normal aging and AD spectrum. Our results indicate that the medial temporal stiffness significantly predicts future cognitive decline beyond that achieved by measures of atrophy and amyloidosis. Measures of brain biomechanical properties may provide valuable prognostic information to enable more efficient study design and evaluation of potential interventions.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
40029915,Prevalence and correlation of sarcopenia with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, which is defined by a decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength associated with aging, is common among older individuals and presents considerable health dangers. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent degenerative brain condition linked to a decrease in cognitive function. The intersection of these conditions remains underexplored. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to establish the frequency of sarcopenia in individuals with AD and investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and AD.
METHODS: We performed an extensive review of literature databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, through April 2024. The inclusion criteria included studies that provided data on the frequency of sarcopenia in patients with AD or that examined the odds ratios (ORs) associated with these comorbidities. R Studio (4.3.1) was utilized for conducting the statistical analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 27 studies, comprising 3902 AD patients were included. In patients with AD, the combined occurrence of sarcopenia was 33.9%, with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, ranging from 27.6% to 40.2%. Sarcopenia was found in 31.2% (95% CI: 0.223-0.402) and 41.9% (95% CI: 0.321-0.516) of patients with mild and moderate AD, respectively. The OR for the association between AD and sarcopenia was 2.670 (95% CI: 1.566-4.555), suggesting a robust correlation.
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in AD patients, highlighting the need for integrated care approaches to address both cognitive and physical health issues. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological links between AD and sarcopenia.",PLoS One,2025

39824235,"Associations of blood-based biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases with mortality, cardio- and cerebrovascular events in persons with chronic coronary syndrome.","BACKGROUND: In light of growing evidence highlighting interactions between cardiac and brain health, we investigated associations of biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases with adverse outcomes (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, and stroke) in persons with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS).
METHODS: We used data from a cohort of persons with CCS for whom major adverse events were recorded over a follow-up of 20 years. We measured biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in baseline blood samples, using the Single-Molecule Array Technology on a HD-1 Analyzer. These include biomarkers of neuronal (neurofilament light chain (NfL) (n = 379)) and glial neurodegeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (n = 379)), and Alzheimer's disease pathology (phosphorylated tau181 (n = 379), total tau (n = 377), and amyloid β (Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>) (n = 377)). We applied Cox-proportional hazards models to evaluate associations of these biomarkers with adverse outcomes, adjusting for covariates and exploring interactions with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 genotype.
RESULTS: Participants with higher NfL levels had increased rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Hazard ratio per increase by one standard deviation (95 % confidence interval): all-cause mortality: 1.36 (1.10-1.68); cardiovascular mortality: 1.42 (1.05-1.93)). The Aβ<sub>40</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub>-ratio was linked to incident stroke (0.72 (0.52-1.00)). Associations of GFAP with all-cause mortality and incident stroke were depending on ApoE ε4 genotype. The other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the studied outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In persons with CSS, NfL and the Aβ<sub>40</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub>-ratio were related to mortality and incident stroke, respectively, whereas associations of GFAP with adverse outcomes varied by ApoE genotype. These biomarkers might play a role in linking aging, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.",Exp Gerontol,2025
40065151,UK Biobank data demonstrate long-term exposure to floods is a risk factor for incident dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Flooding has emerged as the most prevalent natural disaster, impacting billions of individuals worldwide. However, the long-term effects of flooding exposure on dementia remain unclear.
METHODS: With a nested case-control design, a risk-set sampling method was used to match cases and controls. Annual cumulative flooding exposure was calculated for each participant. The associations between flooding exposure and incident dementia were assessed using conditional logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Here we show that the risk of flood-related incident dementia is the strongest in the current year and diminished over a span of 6 years. In the fully adjusted model, the cumulative odds ratios (OR) are 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.31) for any dementia, 1.44 (95% CI: 1.36-1.53) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.48-1.83) for vascular dementia, associated with per unit increase in annual cumulative flooding exposure over lag 0-6 years. Participants under the age of 65 years (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.33-1.46) and female participants (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.33-1.49) exhibit a higher risk of incident dementia compared to those aged 65 years and older (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.21-1.28) and male participants (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.23-1.30), respectively. Similar effect estimates are observed in the stratified analyses of Alzheimer's disease according to genetic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides robust epidemiological evidence supporting the link between floods and an increased risk of dementia. These findings enhance the understanding of the long-term consequences of flood exposure.",Commun Med (Lond),2025
39736793,Blood-based biomarkers and plasma Aβ assays in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: The differentiation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) can be complicated in the initial phase by shared symptoms and pathophysiological traits. Nevertheless, advancements in understanding AD's diverse pathobiology suggest the potential for establishing blood-based methods for differential diagnosis.
METHODS: We devised a novel assay combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to quantify Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in plasma. We then assessed its performance against existing assays (Shimadzu and Simoa) and evaluated a range of other blood-based biomarkers, including GFAP, NfL, and pTau-181, for differentiating between AD and bvFTD.
RESULTS: The novel IP-MS assay measuring the Aβ42/40 ratio demonstrated an AUC of 0.82 for differentiating AD from control subjects. While it did not significantly outperform the composite biomarker score from the Shimadzu assay (AUC = 0.79, P = 0.67), it significantly outperformed the Shimadzu Aβ42/40 ratio (AUC = 0.65, P = 0.037) and the Simoa Aβ42/40 assay (AUC = 0.57, P = 0.023). Aβ biomarkers provided limited utility in distinguishing AD from bvFTD. In contrast, pTau181 and GFAP exhibited strong discriminatory power for differentiating AD from bvFTD, with AUCs of 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. Combining pTau181 and GFAP enhanced diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.94.
CONCLUSION: We introduced a novel IP-MS assay that demonstrated comparable precision to the Shimadzu composite score in differentiating AD from non-neurodegenerative control groups. However, Aβ levels did not enhance the discrimination between AD and bvFTD. Furthermore, our findings support the utility of combining pTau181 and GFAP as a robust strategy for the blood-based differentiation of AD and bvFTD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024

39828895,Potential role of formononetin as a novel natural agent in Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis comorbidity.,"BACKGROUND: The growing aging population has led to an increase in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis (OP), both of which significantly impair quality of life. The comorbid nature of these conditions suggests a shared genetic etiology, the understanding of which is crucial for developing targeted therapies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the shared genetic etiology underlying AD and OP, using a system biology approach to identify potential therapeutic targets and natural compounds for treatment.
METHODS: We employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) with molecular docking strategies to uncover the genetic links between AD and OP. MT2A and CACNA1C were identified as key pleiotropic hub genes potentially linking AD and OP. Molecular docking was utilized to screen for compounds with therapeutic potential, leading to the identification of formononetin as a compound with significant binding affinity to these hub genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation was conducted to confirm the gene expression changes in disease models.
RESULTS: Our study indicate that formononetin exhibits strong binding affinity to the identified hub genes, MT2A and CACNA1C. qRT-PCR validation confirmed the upregulation of these genes in disease models, which was mitigated upon treatment with formononetin, suggesting a reversal of disease markers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study advances our understanding of the genetic intersections between AD and OP and positions formononetin as a promising natural agent for further translational research. Formononetin's multi-target potential makes it a valuable candidate for managing these comorbid conditions, meriting further investigation and development as a therapeutic strategy.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39849276,Ursonic Acid Ameliorates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-Induced Oxidative Damage in PC12 Cells and Prolonged the Lifespan in C. elegans by Activating MAPKs/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway.,"Growing evidence suggests that plant compounds are emerging as a tremendous source for slowing the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ursonic acid (UNA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid with some hypoglycemic, anticancer, and antiinflammatory activities. However, the pharmacological effects of UNA on AD are still unknown. In the present experiments, the effects and mechanisms of UNA on AD were firstly explored by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PC12 cells and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced AD model of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The results showed that UNA increased the cell viability and the level of mitochondrial membrane potential and reversed apoptosis in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PC12 cells, and Nrf2 and HO-1 were involved in this process. UNA also decreased the phosphorylation of related proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, we found that UNA upregulated cellular catalase levels and decreased ROS production. Besides, UNA could activate the Nrf2 /HO-1 signaling pathway and upregulate its protein expression under oxidative stress conditions, whereas Nrf2 and HO-1 inhibitors partially eliminated the protective ability of UNA. The results of in vivo experiments showed that UNA prolonged the lifespan and enhanced the health parameters of AD C. elegans and reduced Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neurotoxicity and ROS levels. Moreover, UNA increased GFP-tagged LGG-1 puncta in DA2123 C. elegans. Further mechanistic studies suggested that the protection of UNA on AD C. elegans may be through modulation of the MAPKs/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. These results highlight the neuroprotective potential of UNA and suggest that UNA may be an effective therapeutic agent for alleviating AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39891246,Glymphatic system clearance and Alzheimer's disease risk: a CSF proteome-wide study.,"BACKGROUND: The emerging evidence of the role of the glymphatic system (GS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides new opportunities for intervention from the earliest stages of the disease. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of GS in AD to identify new disease biomarkers.
METHODS: We performed a two-stage proteomic study to evaluate the GS health using intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) with serial T1 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). In Stage 1 (evaluated in the Cohort 1 of aMCI participants (n = 11)), we correlated the levels of 7K cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins (estimated by SOMAscan) with GS health in 78 Freesurfer-segmented brain regions of interest (ROIs).
RESULTS: A total of seven different proteins were significantly associated with GS health (p-value &lt; 6.4 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). The stronger correlations were identified for NSUN6, GRAAK, OLFML3, ACTN2, RUXF, SHPS1 and TIM-4. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the proteins associated with GS health were mainly implicated in neurodegenerative processes, immunity and inflammation. In Stage 2, we validated these proteomic results in a new cohort of aMCI participants (with and without evidence of AD pathology in CSF (aMCI(-) and aMCI/AD( +); n = 22 and 7, respectively) and healthy controls (n = 10). Proteomic prediction models were generated in each ROI. These were compared with demographic-only models for identifying participants with aMCI(-) and aMCI/AD( +) vs controls. This analysis was repeated to determine if the models could identify those with aMCI/AD( +) from both aMCI(-) and controls. The proteomic models were found to outperform the demographic-only models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies proteins linked with GS health and involved the immune system in aMCI participants.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40169354,Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and risk of incident dementia: a distributed network analysis using common data models.,"BACKGROUND: The link between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and dementia risk is poorly understood, with conflicting evidence on the role of LDL-C and the impact of statin therapy on cognitive outcomes. Thus, we aimed to examine the association between low-density LDL-C levels and the risk of dementia and assess the influence of statin therapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 11 university hospitals participating in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). Participants with a prior diagnosis of dementia or those with <180 days of observation before cohort inclusion, and those included in both cohorts were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause dementia, with the secondary outcome being Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD). The study utilised 1:1 propensity score matching to compare individuals with LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) against those with levels above 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L), resulting in a primary analysis cohort of 108 980 matched patients. Secondary analyses further examined LDL-C thresholds below 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) and the influence of statin use.
RESULTS: The LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) were associated with a 26% reduction in the risk of all-cause dementia and a 28% reduction in the risk of ADRD, compared with levels above 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L). For LDL-C levels below 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), there was an 18% risk reduction for both outcomes. Among those with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L), statin use was associated with a 13% reduction in all-cause dementia risk and a 12% decrease in ADRD risk compared with non-users.
CONCLUSION: Low LDL-C levels (<70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L)) are significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia, including ADRD, with statin therapy providing additional protective effects. These findings support the necessity of targeted lipid management as a preventive strategy against dementia, indicating the importance of personalised treatment approaches.",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,2025
39686618,Associations between antidiabetic medications and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance is pivotal in mediating amyloid and tau dysregulations in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of different antidiabetic agents, their daily dosage intake, and treatment duration on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers among patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study selected patients between 50 and 80 years with diabetes and CSF AD biomarkers screened between 2017 and 2023 in the VALCODIS Cohort. CSF biomarkers were total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau), and amyloid-β 42 (Aβ<sub>42</sub>). Analytical variables were obtained. Antidiabetic prescriptions were recorded in defined daily doses (DDD), according to the ATC/DDD 2021 system, and years of drug exposure duration before lumbar puncture. Logistic regressions were performed to establish the correlations between drug usage and AD biomarker alteration.
RESULTS: Among patients with diabetes, Insulin consumption was associated with lower odds of abnormal Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels (OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.15, 0.76]) and tau pathology (OR 0.49 [95% CI 0.24-0.98]). Metformin was related to lower odds of pathological p-tau when diabetes was uncontrolled, acting on t-tau and t-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio when it was concomitant with insulin, and patients had controlled diabetes. Lower odds of pathological levels of tau were observed when additional oral antidiabetic drugs were added among metformin users. iSGLT2 was associated with tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of antidiabetics on AD-related pathological biomarkers may depend on diabetes management.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40083151,Connectomics and neurotransmitter receptor profile explain regional tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease tau pathology spreads through neuronal pathways and synaptic connections. Alteration in synaptic activity facilitates tau spreading. Multiple neurotransmitter systems are shown to be implicated in Alzheimer's disease, but their influence on the trans-synaptic spread of tau is not well understood. I aimed to combine resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomics, neurotransmitter receptor profiles, and tau-PET data to explain the regional susceptibility to tau accumulation. The tau-PET imaging data of 161 amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired participants as control and 259 amyloid-beta-positive subjects were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Linear regression analysis revealed that a higher tau-PET z-score is associated with a lower density of nine receptors in the serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, and glutamate systems. Furthermore, adding four neurotransmitter receptor density z-scores significantly increased the proportion of explained variance by 3% to 7% compared to the epicenter-connectivity distance model in the group-level analysis. Also, adding nine neurotransmitter receptor density z-scores to the epicenter-connectivity distance model increased the explanatory power of variability in individual levels of tau-PET z-score by 3% to 8%. The current study demonstrated the additive value of atlas-based neurotransmitter receptor mapping and individual-level amyloid-beta-PET scans to enhance the connectivity-based explanation of tau accumulation.",Cereb Cortex,2025
39805990,Deficits in reaching movements under visual interference as a novel diagnostic marker for mild cognitive impairment.,"Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may exhibit poorer performance in visuomotor tasks than healthy individuals, particularly under conditions with high cognitive load. Few studies have examined reaching movements in MCI and did so without assessing susceptibility to distractor interference. This proof-of-concept study analyzed the kinematics of visually guided reaching movements towards a target dot placed along the participants' midsagittal/reaching axis. Movements were performed with and without a visual distractor (flanker) at various distances from the reaching axis. Participants were instructed to avoid ""touching"" the flanker during movement execution. The whole sample included 11 patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease, 10 healthy older adults, and 12 healthy young adults, all right-handed. Patients with MCI performed reaching movements whose trajectories deviated significantly away from the flanker, especially when it was 1 mm away, with less consistent trajectories than controls. Also, our results suggest that trajectory curvature may discriminate between patients with MCI and healthy older adults. The analysis of reaching movements under conditions of visual interference may enhance the diagnosis of MCI, underscoring the need for multidimensional assessments incorporating both cognitive and motor domains.",Sci Rep,2025
39838434,Machine learning models for dementia screening to classify brain amyloid positivity on positron emission tomography using blood markers and demographic characteristics: a retrospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Intracerebral amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is considered the initial observable event in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Efficient screening for amyloid pathology is critical for identifying patients for early treatment. This study developed machine learning models to classify positron emission tomography (PET) Aβ-positivity in participants with preclinical and prodromal AD using data accessible to primary care physicians.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study assessed the classification performance of combinations of demographic characteristics, routine blood test results, and cognitive test scores to classify PET Aβ-positivity using machine learning. Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal cognitive function who visited Oita University Hospital or had participated in the USUKI study and met the study eligibility criteria were included. The primary endpoint was assessment of the classification performance of the presence or absence of intracerebral Aβ accumulation using five machine learning models (i.e., five combinations of variables), each constructed with three classification algorithms, resulting in a total of 15 patterns. L2-regularized logistic regression, and kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Elastic Net algorithms were used to construct the classification models using 34 pre-selected variables (12 demographic characteristics, 11 blood test results, 11 cognitive test results).
RESULTS: Data from 262 records (260 unique participants) were analyzed. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) participant age was 73.8 (7.8) years. Using L2-regularized logistic regression, the mean receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (SD) in Model 0 (basic demographic characteristics) was 0.67 (0.01). Classification performance was similar in Model 1 (basic demographic characteristics and Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] subscores) and Model 2 (demographic characteristics and blood test results) with a cross-validated mean ROC AUC (SD) of 0.70 (0.01) for both. Model 3 (demographic characteristics, blood test results, MMSE subscores) and Model 4 (Model 3 and ApoE4 phenotype) showed improved performance with a mean ROC AUC (SD) of 0.73 (0.01) and 0.76 (0.01), respectively. In models using blood test results, thyroid-stimulating hormone and mean corpuscular volume tended to be the largest contributors to classification. Classification performances were similar using the SVM and Elastic Net algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning models used in this study were useful for classifying PET Aβ-positivity using data from routine physician visits.

39914061,Differences in cholinergic terminal density in adults with Down syndrome compared to neurotypical controls measured by [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol positron emission tomography imaging.,"Adults with Down syndrome are genetically predisposed to developing Alzheimer's disease after the age of 40. The cholinergic system, which is critical for cognitive functioning, is known to decline in Alzheimer's disease and although first investigated in individuals with Down syndrome 40 years ago, remains relatively understudied. Existing studies suggest individuals with Down syndrome have an intact cholinergic system at birth that declines through adulthood alongside the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The present study provides the first description of cholinergic terminals in vivo in non-demented adults with Down syndrome utilizing [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol PET imaging. In addition, we investigated age-associated decline in cholinergic terminal density. Sixteen (16) non-demented adults with Down syndrome (mean age 35.5, 8 females) and 20 neurotypically developed individuals (mean age 35.5, 10 females) were studied, comparing radiotracer uptake groupwise and associations with age utilizing a voxel-based approach. Adults with Down syndrome displayed significantly increased [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol uptake in the cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, and numerous cortical regions compared to age-matched controls following an unpaired t-test thresholded at p &lt; 0.001 and minimum cluster size 50. Cholinergic terminal density in numerous cortical regions showed a steeper decline associated with older age in adults with Down syndrome than observed in neurotypically developed adults in the age range tested following a generalized linear model testing the interaction between age and group, thresholded at p &lt; 0.005 and minimum cluster size 50. These data suggest higher cholinergic terminal density in early adulthood in individuals with Down syndrome, with a greater age-related difference than is observed in neurotypically developed individuals.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39919076,Characterization of gene expression profiles in Alzheimer's disease and osteoarthritis: A bioinformatics study.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Osteoarthritis (OA) have been shown to have a close association in previous studies, but the pathogenesis of both diseases are unclear. This study explores the potential common molecular mechanisms between AD and OA through bioinformatics analysis, providing new insights for clinical treatment strategies.
METHODS: The AD and OA-related datasets were downloaded from the gene expression database GEO. The datasets were analyzed to obtain differentially expressed gene (DEG) datasets for OA and AD, respectively. The intersection of these DEGs was analyzed to identify common DEGs (Co-DEGs). Subsequently, the Co-DEGs were enriched, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify core genes. The expression of these genes was validated in a separate dataset, and their diagnostic value for the diseases was analyzed. In addition, the core genes were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis and single-gene genome variation analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis of DEGs on gene chips from OA and AD patients revealed significant changes in gene expression patterns. Notably, EFEMP2 and TSPO, genes associated with inflammatory responses, showed lower expression levels in both AD and OA patients, suggesting a downregulation in the pathological backgrounds of these diseases. Additionally, GABARAPL1, which is crucial for the maturation of autophagosomes, was found to be upregulated in both conditions. These findings suggest the potential of these genes as diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, to confirm the effectiveness of these genes as therapeutic targets, more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed in the future, particularly to explore the feasibility and specific mechanisms of combating disease progression by regulating the expression of these genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that AD and OA shares common molecular mechanisms. The identification of EFEMP2, GABARAPL1, and TSPO as key target genes highlights potential common factors in both diseases. Further investigation into these findings could lead to new candidate targets and treatment directions for AD and OA, offering promising avenues for developing more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions.",PLoS One,2025
39959571,Learning disentangled representations to harmonize connectome network measures.,"PURPOSE: Connectome network metrics are commonly regarded as fundamental properties of the brain, and their alterations have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. However, these metrics are actually estimated properties through a multistage propagation from local voxel diffusion estimations, regional tractography, and region of interest mapping. These estimation processes are significantly influenced by choices specific to imaging protocols and software, producing site-wise effects.
APPROACH: Recent advances in disentanglement techniques offer opportunities to learn representational spaces that separate factors that cause domain shifts from intrinsic biological factors. Although these techniques have been applied in unsupervised brain anomaly detection and image-level features, their application to the unique manifold structures of connectome adjacency matrices remains unexplored. Here, we explore the conditional variational autoencoder structure for generating site-invariant representations of the connectome, allowing the harmonization of brain network measures.
RESULTS: Focusing on the context of aging, we conducted a study involving 823 patients across two sites. This approach effectively segregates site-specific influences from biological features, aligns network measures across different domains (Cohen's D &lt; 0.2  and Mann-Whitney U - test &lt; 0.05  ), and maintains associations with age ( 2.71 × 10 - 02  ± 2.86 × 10 - 03    error in years) and sex ( 0.92 ± 0.02  accuracy).

39996035,Amyloid is associated with accelerated atrophy in cognitively unimpaired individuals.,"INTRODUCTION: This study examined the association of longitudinal atrophy with baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ, A) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau, T) biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181) in 406 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals (6.670 years of follow-up on average, up to 13 imaging visits) to assess whether A+ is associated with Alzheimer's disease-like atrophy and whether this depends on p-tau181 levels.
METHODS: An A-T- CU group free from abnormal neurodegeneration (N) was identified using a robust normative approach and used to model normal age-related atrophy via z-scoring. Linear mixed-effects models tested differences in longitudinal atrophy between A+ and A-T-N- individuals and between A/T subgroups.
RESULTS: A+ was associated with worse atrophy within and beyond the medial temporal lobe, even at low levels of p-tau181.
DISCUSSION: Neurodegeneration likely begins soon after the onset of abnormal Aβ pathology. Clinical intervention at the earliest signs of Aβ pathology may be needed to mitigate further neurodegeneration.

39935870,"Hypertension moderates the relationship between plasma beta-amyloid and cognitive impairment: a cross-sectional study in Xi'an, China.","BACKGROUND: Plasma beta-amyloid (Aβ) are important biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment (CI), but results are controversial. It remains unclear whether hypertension modulates their relationship. This cross-sectional study investigates whether hypertension moderates the relationship between plasma Aβ and cognitive impairment (CI).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1488 subjects ≥ 40 years from rural areas of northwestern China. CI was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score lower than the cutoff. Firstly, plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> were analyzed as restricted cubic spline. Then, categories of combined plasma Aβ were created by making bisection of plasma Aβ according to average and combining them as L-Aβ<sub>40</sub> and L-Aβ<sub>42</sub>, H-Aβ<sub>40</sub> and L-Aβ<sub>42</sub>, L-Aβ<sub>40</sub> and H-Aβ<sub>42</sub>, H-Aβ<sub>40</sub> and H-Aβ<sub>42</sub>. Decreased plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> was defined as &lt; 25th percentile. Multivariate logistic regression examined the relationship between plasma Aβ and CI in total population, the hypertension subgroup and the non-hypertension subgroup.
RESULTS: 737 participants (49.5%) had hypertension and 189 participants (12.7%) had CI. Simultaneously elevated plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> was associated with CI in hypertension (H-Aβ<sub>40</sub> and H-Aβ<sub>42</sub> vs. L-Aβ<sub>40</sub> and L-Aβ<sub>42</sub>, 21.1% vs.10.7%, P = 0.033; OR = 1.984 [95% CI, 1.067-3.691], P = 0.030) but not in the non-hypertension. Decreased plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> was associated with CI in the non-hypertension (14.9% vs. 9.2%, P = 0.026; OR = 1.728 [95% CI, 1.018-2.931], P = 0.043) but not in the hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension is an important modulator in the relationship between plasma Aβ and CI. Simultaneously elevated plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the hypertension, and decreased plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> in the non-hypertension, may be risk factors for CI.

METHODS: Thirty-three different p-tau assays measured paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 40 participants (25 with ""AD pathology"" and 15 with ""non-AD pathology"" by CSF amyloid beta [Aβ]42/Aβ40 and p-tau181 criteria). Four CRMs were assessed.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 demonstrated higher fold-changes between AD and non-AD than other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 provided the highest fold-changes. Plasma p-tau217 showed the strongest correlations between plasma assays (rho = 0.81-0.97). The CRMs were not commutable across assays.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 showed larger fold-changes and better accuracy for detecting AD pathology in symptomatic individuals, with greater cross-platform agreement than other p-tau variants. Further work is needed to develop suitable CRMs facilitating cross-assay standardization.
HIGHLIGHTS: Paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from twenty-five Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 15 non-AD patients were measured blind.

METHODS: One hundred and seventy plasma samples from the University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimer's (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.
RESULTS: Fujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy findings, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath area under the curve [AUC] = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC = 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.
DISCUSSION: Our study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay-specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.
HIGHLIGHTS: Two commercially available p-tau217 immunoassays (ALZpath and Fujirebio) showed equal performance based on CSF testing.ALZpath p-tau217 showed higher performance compared to Fujirebio p-tau217 based on AD diagnosis by neuropathology confirmation.Specific plasma p-tau217 assays may require distinct decision points for AD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression monitoring.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39804890,Sex-specific associations of serum testosterone with gray matter volume and cerebral blood flow in midlife individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Testosterone, an essential sex steroid hormone, influences brain health by impacting neurophysiology and neuropathology throughout the lifespan in both genders. However, human research in this area is limited, particularly in women. This study examines the associations between testosterone levels, gray matter volume (GMV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in midlife individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), according to sex and menopausal status. A cohort of 294 cognitively normal midlife participants, 83% female, ages 35-65 years, with an AD family history and/or Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE-4) genotype, underwent volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to measure GMV and MR-Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) for measurement of CBF. We used voxel-based analysis and volumes of interest to test for associations between testosterone (both total and free testosterone) and brain imaging outcomes, stratified by sex and menopausal status. Higher total and free testosterone levels were associated with larger GMV in men, with peak effects in frontal and temporal regions. Conversely, in women, higher testosterone levels correlated with higher CBF, with peak effects in frontal and limbic regions, subcortical areas and hypothalamus. Among women, associations between testosterone and GMV were observed at the premenopausal and perimenopausal stages, but not postmenopause, whereas associations of testosterone with CBF were significant starting at the perimenopausal stage and were more pronounced among hormone therapy non-users. Results were independent of age, APOE-4 status, midlife health indicators, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels. These findings indicate sex-specific neurophysiological effects of testosterone in AD-vulnerable regions in midlife individuals at risk for AD, with variations observed across sex and menopausal status. This underscores the need for further research focusing on the neuroprotective potential of testosterone in both sexes.",PLoS One,2025
40007082,Linguistic cues for automatic assessment of Alzheimer's disease across languages.,"BACKGROUND: Most common forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, are associated with alterations in spoken language.

40052563,Visual-somatosensory integration as a novel behavioral marker of amyloid pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: The ability to integrate information across sensory modalities is a vital aspect of everyday functioning and is linked to cognition. Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology manifests in sensory association areas before appearing in higher-order cognitive areas. We examined the role of visual-somatosensory integration (VSI) as a novel behavioral marker of AD-associated amyloid pathology.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 243 adults (77 ± 6.5 years; 52% female) who completed the VSI test and AD biomarker assays. The magnitude of VSI was the independent variable and amyloid-beta probability scores (APS; PrecivityAD<sup>TM</sup>) were the dependent variable. Cognitive status (normal, mild cognitive impairment, or AD) was assigned during case conferences.
RESULTS: Linear regression revealed an inverse association between the magnitude of VSI and APS (β = -0.16; p ≤ 0.01). As cognitive impairment increased from normal to dementia, the magnitude of VSI decreased (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Findings provide support for VSI impairment as a new behavioral marker of AD-associated amyloid pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Here we provide support for the magnitude of VSI as a novel behavioral marker of AD-associated amyloid pathology given its significant association with an established, accurate, and reliable biomarker of AD pathology. Adults with normal cognition maintained the highest magnitude of VSI and brain amyloid negative scores. As cognitive impairment increased, the mean magnitude of VSI significantly decreased while amyloid probability scores (APS) increased. In fact, individuals with dementia revealed the lowest magnitude of VSI and the highest APS. Our research continues to emphasize the importance of successful multisensory integration in aging, where the establishment of future novel multisensory-based interventions aimed at preventing disability and optimizing independence could prove valuable.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

By employing mass spectrometry imaging and stable isotope labeling, we timestamped Aβ plaques from their initial deposition, enabling the spatial tracking of plaque aging. Correlating single-plaque spatial transcriptomics with time since seeding, allowed us to track gene-expression changes specifically associated with plaque age, independent of chronological age of the mouse or disease severity. We found that plaque age, within sections from individual mice aged from 10 to 18 months, negatively correlates with synaptic gene expression. Further, correlation with hyperspectral confocal microscopy using structure-specific dyes revealed a positive link between plaque age and structural maturity, with older plaques identified as more compact and associated with significantly greater synapse loss and toxicity.",Res Sq,2025
40100818,Potential multiple disease progression pathways in female patients with Alzheimer's disease inferred from transcriptome and epigenome data of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical type of dementia for which therapeutic strategies have not yet been established. The database of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease study by the ENCODE consortium contains transcriptome and various epigenome data. Although the Rush AD database may contain a satisfactory amount of data for women, the amount of data for men remains insufficient. Here, based on an analysis of publicly available data from female patients, this study found that AD pathology appears to be nonuniform; AD patients were divided into several groups with differential gene expression patterns, including those related to cognitive function. First, cluster analysis was performed on individuals diagnosed with ""No Cognitive Impairment (NCI),"" ""Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease (AD)"" stages in clinical trials using gene expression, and multiple substages were identified across AD progression. The epigenome data, in particular genome-wide H3k4me3 distribution data, also supported the existence of multiple AD substages. However, APOE gene polymorphisms of individuals seemed to not correlate with disease stage. An inference of adjacency networks among substages, evaluated via partition-based graph abstraction using the gene expression profiles of individuals, suggested the possibility of multiple typical disease progression pathways from NCI to different AD substages through various MCI substages. These findings could refine biomarker discovery or inform personalized therapeutic approaches.",PLoS One,2025
40078479,Investigation of the role of miRNA variants in neurodegenerative brain diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: miRNAs are small noncoding elements known to regulate different molecular processes, including developmental and executive functions in the brain. Dysregulation of miRNAs could contribute to brain neurodegeneration, as suggested by miRNA profiling studies of individuals suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases (NBDs). Here, we report rare miRNA variants in patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: We initially used whole exome sequencing data in a subset of FTD patients (n = 209) from Flanders-Belgium. We then performed targeted resequencing of variant-harboring miRNAs in an additional subset of FTD patients (n = 126) and control individuals (n = 426). Lastly, we sequenced the MIR885 locus in a Flanders-Belgian AD cohort (n = 947) and a total number of n = 755 controls.
RESULTS: WES identified rare seed variants in MIR656, MIR423, MIR122 and MIR885 in FTD patients. Most of these miRNAs bind to FTD-associated genes, implicated in different biological pathways. Additionally, some miRNA variants create novel binding sites for genes associated with FTD. Sequencing of the MIR885 locus in the AD cohort initially showed a significant enrichment of MIR885 variants in AD patients compared to controls (SKAT-O, p-value = 0.026). Genetic association was not maintained when we included sex and APOE status as covariates. Using the miRVaS prediction tool, variants rs897551430 and rs993255773 appeared to evoke significant structural changes in the primary miRNA. These variants are also predicted to strongly downregulate mature miR885 levels, in line with what is reported for MIR885 in the context of AD.
DISCUSSION: Functional investigation of miRNAs/variants described in this study could propose novel miRNA-mediated molecular cascades in FTD and AD pathogenicity. Furthermore, we believe that the genetic evidence presented here suggests a role for MIR885 in molecular mechanisms involved in AD and warrants genetic follow-up in larger cohorts to explore this hypothesis.",Front Genet,2025
39962097,Stacked CNN-based multichannel attention networks for Alzheimer disease detection.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive condition of a neurological brain disorder recognized by symptoms such as dementia, memory loss, alterations in behaviour, and impaired reasoning abilities. Recently, many researchers have been working to develop an effective AD recognition system using deep learning (DL) based convolutional neural network (CNN) model aiming to deploy the automatic medical image diagnosis system. The existing system is still facing difficulties in achieving satisfactory performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency because of the lack of feature ineffectiveness. This study proposes a lightweight Stacked Convolutional Neural Network with a Channel Attention Network (SCCAN) for MRI based on AD classification to overcome the challenges. In the procedure, we sequentially integrate 5 CNN modules, which form a stack CNN aiming to generate a hierarchical understanding of features through multi-level extraction, effectively reducing noise and enhancing the weight's efficacy. This feature is then fed into a channel attention module to select the practical features based on the channel dimension, facilitating the selection of influential features. . Consequently, the model exhibits reduced parameters, making it suitable for training on smaller datasets. Addressing the class imbalance in the Kaggle MRI dataset, a balanced distribution of samples among classes is emphasized. Extensive experiments of the proposed model with the ADNI1 Complete 1Yr 1.5T, Kaggle, and OASIS-1 datasets showed 99.58%, 99.22%, and 99.70% accuracy, respectively. The proposed model's high performance surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and proved its excellence as a significant advancement in AD classification using MRI images.",Sci Rep,2025
39708761,Modeling functional loss in Alzheimer's Disease through cognitive reserve and cognitive state: A panel data longitudinal study.,"Cognitive Reserve (CR) refers to the brain's ability, supported by active and modifiable forms of lifestyle compensation, to cope with neural changes due to age or disease, delaying the onset of cognitive deficits. In CR studies, neuropsychological performances and functional autonomy are considered alternative outcomes. While decreased functional independence gains importance in dementia diagnosis and monitoring, cognitive functioning may play a role in staging its severity. The main aim of the present study was to test a longitudinal model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), in which CR (years of education) and current cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE, score) would predict clinical progression in terms of loss of functional independence at a later time. From the ADNI database, we considered 308 AD participants, and for 180 of them, we could extract CSF Aβ1-42 baseline levels as an index of amyloid burden. Functional decline (one-year delta score at the Functional Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire) was explained by the CR and MMSE score interaction net of age; a trend was found also when controlling for amyloid burden. Functional decline at one year was increased for patients with high CR levels and low MMSE and with low CR and high cognitive state, compared to the opposite. The present investigation demonstrated the mutual role of past acquired CR and current cognitive status in predicting functional progression in AD. The study suggests a way to predictively interpret available demographic and clinical data, defining differential longitudinal trajectories that might be useful for clinical management.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39713242,Deep learning-based patient stratification for prognostic enrichment of clinical dementia trials.,"Dementia probably due to Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that manifests in cognitive decline and impairs patients' daily life. Affected patients show great heterogeneity in their symptomatic progression, which hampers the identification of efficacious treatments in clinical trials. Using artificial intelligence approaches to enable clinical enrichment trials serves a promising avenue to identify treatments. In this work, we used a deep learning method to cluster the multivariate disease trajectories of 283 early dementia patients along cognitive and functional scores. Two distinct subgroups were identified that separated patients into 'slow' and 'fast' progressing individuals. These subgroups were externally validated and independently replicated in a dementia cohort comprising 2779 patients. We trained a machine learning model to predict the progression subgroup of a patient from cross-sectional data at their time of dementia diagnosis. The classifier achieved a prediction performance of 0.70 ± 0.01 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in external validation. By emulating a hypothetical clinical trial conducting patient enrichment using the proposed classifier, we estimate its potential to decrease the required sample size. Furthermore, we balance the achieved enrichment of the trial cohort against the accompanied demand for increased patient screening. Our results show that enrichment trials targeting cognitive outcomes offer improved chances of trial success and are more than 13% cheaper compared with conventional clinical trials. The resources saved could be redirected to accelerate drug development and expand the search for remedies for cognitive impairment.",Brain Commun,2024

39695988,Exploring the gut-brain axis in alzheimer's disease treatment via probiotics: evidence from animal studies-a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, causing cognitive impairment. Its pathogenesis is characterized by amyloid beta deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Recent research has identified the link between gut dysbiosis, an imbalance of intestinal microorganisms, to this pathogenesis via the gut-brain axis. This study aims to review the probiotics' therapeutic effect, targeting the gut-brain axis, for AD treatment in animals.
METHODS: The method utilized in this study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Three reviewers searched articles through PubMed, Scopus, and Embase using advanced search strategy. Articles published between 2010 and 2023 that met the criteria were included.
RESULTS: Of 2,273 articles, 21 animal studies measuring the effects of probiotics genera Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium on AD via at least one of these four outcomes: AD pathology, cognitive function, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota composition. The results demonstrated that probiotics could repair gut dysbiosis by decreasing pro-inflammatory bacteria and increasing anti-inflammatory bacteria. Repaired dysbiosis was found to be associated with less neuroinflammation as significant reductions in neuroinflammatory markers related to the pathogenesis of AD such as TNF-α (SMD = -2.08, P = 0.005), IL-6 (SMD = -2.98, P < 0.0005), and IL-1β (SMD = -2.49, P = 0.003) were observed. Reduced amyloid beta deposition (SMD = -1.17, P = 0.009) was reported, but reduction in tau hyperphosphorylation was found to be insignificant. For cognitive function, positive results were demonstrated for all three aspects of cognitive function including long-term memory (SMD = 2.55, P < 0.00001), short-term memory (SMD = 1.32, P = 0.003), and spatial recognition (SMD = -1.13, P < 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Particular formulas of probiotics showed potential effectiveness in AD therapies with demonstrated association with the gut-brain axis. Future studies are required to investigate strain-specific results and optimal dosages and regimens.",BMC Neurol,2024
39865328,Association of Alzheimer's and Lewy body disease pathology with basal forebrain volume and cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is a hallmark feature shared by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) whereas hippocampus atrophy is more specifically related to AD. We aimed to investigate the relationship between basal forebrain and hippocampus atrophy, cognitive decline, and neuropathology in a large autopsy sample.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Basal forebrain and hippocampus volumes were extracted using an established automated MRI volumetry approach. Associations of regional volumes with pathological markers (Braak stage, CERAD score, and McKeith criteria for LB pathology) and cognitive performance were assessed using Bayesian statistical methods.
RESULTS: We included people with autopsy-confirmed pure AD (N = 248), pure LBD (N = 22), and mixed AD/LBD (N = 185). Posterior basal forebrain atrophy was most severe in mixed AD/LB pathology compared to pure AD (Bayes factor against the null hypothesis BF<sub>10</sub> = 16.2) or pure LBD (BF<sub>10</sub> = 4.5). In contrast, hippocampal atrophy was primarily associated with AD pathology, independent of LB pathology (pure AD vs. pure LBD: BF<sub>10</sub> = 166, pure AD vs. mixed AD/LBD: BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.11, pure LBD vs. mixed AD/LBD: BF<sub>10</sub> = 350). Cognitive performance was more impaired in AD pathology groups, with Braak stage being the strongest predictor. Hippocampal volume partially mediated this relationship between tau pathology and cognitive impairment, while basal forebrain volume had a limited role in mediating the relationship between pathological burden and cognitive outcomes.
CONCLUSION: In a heterogeneous autopsy sample, AD and LB pathology both contribute to cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration whereas hippocampus atrophy is more specifically related to AD pathology. Cognitive deficits are primarily associated with tau pathology which is partly mediated by hippocampus, but not basal forebrain atrophy.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39975973,The role of sleep in Alzheimer's disease: a mini review.,Sleep is a stereotyped and well-preserved series of neurophysiological states that are essential for overall health and brain functioning. Emerging research suggests that sleep disturbances are not only associated with but also causally contribute to neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. This mini-review examines some of the current knowledge and evidence for relationships between sleep abnormalities and Alzheimer's disease within context of possible uses and limitations of sleep biomarkers for evaluation of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding these relationships could lead to readily accessible and easily quantifiable biomarkers of Alzheimer's dementia.,Front Neurosci,2025
40129408,Interactive effects of APOE ɛ4 status and vascular burden on white matter microstructural integrity in aging with and without neurocognitive decline.,"BackgroundCarrying the Apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 allele lowers age of onset and increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Neuropathological findings suggest a mixed etiology in many AD patients, and vascular pathology is common.ObjectiveThis study tested the interactive effect of APOE status and multiple vascular comorbidities on white matter (WM) microstructure in aging and early AD.Methods195 participants from the VPH-DARE@IT dataset were stratified in low/high vascular burden based on the Framingham Risk Score (BMI version). Tract-based spatial statistics was used for WM analyses.ResultsThere was a main effect of APOE, with APOE ɛ4 carriers having higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower axial diffusivity (AxD), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) than non-carriers. There was a main effect of vascular burden with lower FA and higher AxD, MD, and RD in the high-burden than the low-burden group. A significant interaction between APOE genotype and vascular burden was also found for all diffusion indices. Post-hoc comparisons revealed lower left hemisphere WM integrity when comparing the low risk group (i.e., non-carriers low burden) to intermediate risk groups (i.e., non-carriers high burden or ɛ4 carriers low burden). The contrasts between the two intermediate risk groups showed altered WM integrity bilaterally. Only the non-carriers high burden showed greater alterations in WM integrity when compared with the high risk group (i.e., ɛ4 carriers high burden) mainly in right hemisphere tracts.ConclusionsThese findings indicate an interactive effect of a risk gene and vascular comorbidities on WM integrity in aging and early AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39976261,Implementing a tridimensional diagnostic framework for personalized medicine in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose a significant challenge in modern medicine due to their clinical heterogeneity, multifactorial etiologies, and frequent co-pathologies. Traditional diagnostic systems, based on clinical symptoms and post mortem findings, are limited in capturing the complex interactions among genetic, molecular, and neuroanatomical factors. This manuscript introduces a novel tridimensional diagnostic framework that integrates these factors across three key axes: etiology (genetic and environmental influences), molecular markers (primary and secondary biomarkers), and neuroanatomoclinical correlations. Through case studies, we demonstrate the framework's ability to synthesize incomplete datasets, stratify patients, and guide precision medicine. By incorporating omics technologies, neuroimaging, and AI-driven probabilistic modeling, the framework enhances diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. This approach may contribute to overcoming the limitations of traditional nosologies, offering a scalable and adaptable tool for both clinical practice and research and advancing the field of precision medicine in NDD management. HIGHLIGHTS: Tridimensional diagnostic system: We propose a new framework that incorporates three axes - etiology, molecular markers, and neuroanatomical-clinical correlations - to enhance diagnostic accuracy for NDDs. Personalized medicine: The tridimensional system enables the integration of genetic, molecular, and clinical data, allowing for highly personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patients. Proteinopathies as key biomarkers: This diagnostic system emphasizes the use of primary proteinopathies (amyloid, tau, synuclein) and secondary biomarkers (eg, NfL, GFAP) to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Addressing clinical heterogeneity: The framework accommodates the complexity and heterogeneity of NDDs, offering an adaptable diagnostic approach for classical conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS. Case studies and real-world application: Practical case studies illustrate how this system can be implemented in clinical practice, enabling the combination of DMTs with symptomatic treatments.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40128538,Caregiver burden of Alzheimer's disease among informal caregivers: a cross-sectional study in Malaysia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) not only impacts the patients but substantially informal caregivers in terms of physical and psychological burden. This study aims to determine the burden level of informal caregivers of patients with different stages of AD and use of special accommodation (SpA) along with its predictors. A cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing AD patients and informal caregivers recruited from 4 tertiary hospitals. Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) was used to estimate caregivers' burden. The analysis categorized informal caregivers of AD patients into two groups based on the use of SpA. Multivariable linear regression was employed to identify potential determinants of subjective caregiver burden. As a result, caregivers' burden experienced by informal caregivers of severe community-dwelling AD patients was significantly higher (p = 0.024) than those with special accommodation. As AD advanced, caregivers' burden was elevated significantly (p = 0.021) from mild to severe AD among community-dwelling patients. In multivariable analysis, severe AD (standardised β = 0.187, p = 0.047 vs. mild AD) and spousal relationship (standardised β = 0.241, p = 0.026 vs. other relationships) were found to be significant factors in predicting caregivers' burden. Hence, the physical and social needs of informal caregivers must not be overlooked. Severe AD significantly increased caregiver burden in community dwelling patients. Spousal caregivers report a higher perceived burden compared to caregivers with other relationships. Policymakers need to recognize and address the substantial demands placed on informal caregivers by providing essential social support. Special accommodation could alleviate the burden on informal caregivers, particularly those caring for patients with severe AD.",Sci Rep,2025
39829171,KIF9 Ameliorates Neuropathology and Cognitive Dysfunction by Promoting Macroautophagy in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly. The imbalance of protein production and degradation processes leads to the accumulation of misfolded and abnormally aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the extracellular space and forms senile plaques, which constitute one of the most critical pathological hallmarks of AD. KIF9, a member of the kinesin protein superfamily, mediates the anterograde transport of intracellular cargo along microtubules. However, the exact role of KIF9 in AD pathogenesis remains largely elusive. In this study, we reported that the expression of kinesin family member 9 (KIF9) in the hippocampus of APP23/PS45 double-transgenic AD model mice declined in an age-dependent manner, concurrent with macroautophagy dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that KIF9 mediated the transport of lysosomes through kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), thereby participating in the degradation of amyloidogenic pathway-related proteins of Aβ precursor protein (APP) in AD model cells through promoting the macroautophagy pathway. Importantly, genetic upregulation of KIF9 via adeno-associated virus (AAV) diminished Aβ deposition and alleviated cognitive impairments in AD model mice by enhancing macroautophagy function. Collectively, our findings underscore the ability of KIF9 to promote macroautophagy through KLC1-mediated anterograde transport of lysosomes, effectively ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. These discoveries suggest that KIF9 may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",Aging Cell,2025
39748853,The association of dementia risk symptoms and functional activity in adults with Down syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, often showing neuropathological indicators by age 40. Physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) are understudied areas of function that may inform dementia risk. We investigated associations among age, physical function (gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity strength), ADLs, and dementia risk symptoms in adults with DS. We hypothesized that compromised physical function and lower independence with ADLs would be associated with an informant/caregiver-reported measure of dementia risk symptoms.
METHODS: A secondary analysis for this cross-sectional study was completed using data from two academic research centers with 43 adults with DS (age 30 ± 12 years). We examined the association of dementia risk symptoms, captured through the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID), with physical function (timed up and go [TUG], sit-to-stand [STS], grip strength) and ADLs (Waisman Activities of Daily Living Scale). A linear regression model for the continuous dementia risk measure in the DSQIID used a log transformation of (1 + log(Y + 1)) to account for a high zero count. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess differences in the physical function measures, DSQIID questionnaire, and Waisman ADL by dividing mean age categories.
RESULTS: Higher DSQIID scores were associated with lower independence with ADLs (β = -0.103, p = 0.008), slower gait times (TUG; β = 0.112, p = 0.034), and impaired lower extremity strength (STS; β = 0.112, p = 0.017) and grip strength (β = -0.039, p = 0.034). DSQIID scores differed significantly between the ≥30 and &lt;30 age groups. Participants ≥30 years of age scored 5 points higher on the DSQIID than participants &lt;30, suggesting that age was associated with greater dementia risk.
DISCUSSION: Greater dementia risk symptoms were associated with age, lower physical function scores, and independence with ADLs, suggesting that declines in physical function and ADLs may be early indicators of subsequent dementia risk in adults with DS.
HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the association of physical function and activities of daily living (ADLs) in aging adults with DS and their relationship with informant/caregiver report of dementia risk symptoms.Our findings demonstrated a significant relationship between a higher number of dementia risk symptoms observed and lower independence with ADLs, and impaired gait/balance, grip strength, and lower extremity strength.Further research with larger longitudinal studies is necessary to investigate any causative relationships among physical function, ADL function, and dementia risk symptoms.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39826774,Adapting to evolving MRI data: A transfer learning approach for Alzheimer's disease prediction.,"Integrating 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with machine learning has shown promising results in healthcare, especially in detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, changes in MRI technologies and acquisition protocols often yield limited data, leading to potential overfitting. This study explores Transfer Learning (TL) approaches to enhance AD diagnosis using a Baseline model consisting of a 3D-Convolutional Neural Network trained on 80 3T MRI scans. Two scenarios are explored: (A) utilizing historical data to address changes in MRI acquisitions (from 1.5T to 3T MRI), and (B) adapting 2D models pre-trained on ImageNet (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101) for 3D image processing when historical data is unavailable. In both scenarios, two modeling approaches are tested. The General Approach involves distinct feature extraction and classification steps, using Radiomic features and TL-based features evaluated with six classifiers. The Deep Approach integrates these steps by fine-tuning the pre-trained models for AD diagnosis. In scenario (A), TL significantly boosts the Baseline's accuracy from 63% to 99%. In scenario (B), Radiomic features better represents 3D MRI than TL-features in the General Approach. Nonetheless, fine-tuning models pre-trained on natural images can increase the Baseline's accuracy by up to 12 percentage points, achieving an overall accuracy of 83%.",Neuroimage,2025
40188044,Photobiomodulation modulates mitochondrial energy metabolism and ameliorates neurological damage in an APP/PS1 mousmodel of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is one of the key pathological features of AD, which is cytotoxic and can damage neurons, thereby causing cognitive dysfunction. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive physical therapy that induces changes in the intrinsic mechanisms of cells and tissues through low-power light exposure. Although PBM has been employed in the treatment of AD, the effect and precise mechanism of PBM on AD-induced neurological damage are still unclear.
METHODS: In vivo experiments, PBM (808 nm, 20 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used to continuously interfere with APP/PS1 mice for 6 weeks, and then their cognitive function and AD pathological changes were evaluated. In vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce microglia to model inflammation, and the effect of PBM treatment on microglia polarization status and phagocytic Aβ ability was evaluated. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) was used to study the effect of PBM treatment on mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia.
RESULTS: PBM further ameliorates AD-induced cognitive impairment by alleviating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, thereby attenuating nerve damage. In addition, PBM can also reduce neuroinflammation by promoting microglial anti-inflammatory phenotypic polarization; Promotes Aβ clearance by enhancing the ability of microglia to engulf Aβ. Among them, PBM regulates microglial polarization and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, which may be related to its regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, promotion of oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibition of glycolysis.
CONCLUSION: PBM regulates neuroinflammatory response and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, thereby repairing Aβ-induced neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction. Mitochondrial energy metabolism plays an important role in PBM in improving nerve injury in AD mice. This study provides theoretical support for the subsequent application of PBM in the treatment of AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39703926,Action observation treatment may improve daily living activities and verb recovery in Parkinson's disease-dementia: findings from a preliminary randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Action observation treatment (AOT) is a novel rehabilitation approach aimed to the recovery of both motor and linguistic deficits in subjects with brain lesions. The aim of the present randomized controlled study was to assess the benefits of AOT treatment in the activities of daily living (ADLs) and in the linguistic abilities of the patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) at mild-moderate stage (Hoehn & Yahr's stage scale: 2-3).
METHODS: Twenty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to an experimental group (submitted to AOT) or to a control group. The experimental group (AOT-group) underwent the vision of a video containing 6 complex ADLs, while the control group (C-group) was subjected to a video-clip regarding semantic information of a geographical-naturalistic type without motor content. The treatment duration was 4 weeks. All patients underwent assessment before and after the treatment by the following tools: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-Part III), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) and subtest Verb Naming of Analysis of Aphasic Deficit Battery (BADA). Paired samples t test was performed to compare all the variables of interest in the time, dividing by groups. p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant in all analyses.
RESULTS: AOT-group showed an improvement from baseline to the end of study in ADCS-ADL (p = 0.001), BADA (p = 0.011) and DAFS (p = 0.005), while C-group did not change significantly in the time.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest the potential efficacy of AOT in rehabilitation of ADLs and verb retrieval in people with PD. Further studies will be necessary to verify these findings.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39885359,Plasma proteomic evidence for increased β-amyloid pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Previous studies have suggested that systemic viral infections may increase risks of dementia. Whether this holds true for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infections is unknown. Determining this is important for anticipating the potential future incidence of dementia. To begin to do this, we measured plasma biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology in the UK Biobank before and after serology-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with biomarkers associated with β-amyloid pathology: reduced plasma Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and, in more vulnerable participants, lower plasma Aβ42 and higher plasma pTau-181. The plasma biomarker changes were greater in participants who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 or had reported hypertension previously. We showed that the changes in biomarkers were linked to brain structural imaging patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease, lower cognitive test scores and poorer overall health evaluations. Our data from this post hoc case-control matched study thus provide observational biomarker evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with greater brain β-amyloid pathology in older adults. While these results do not establish causality, they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 (and possibly other systemic inflammatory diseases) may increase the risk of future Alzheimer's disease.",Nat Med,2025
40185739,Pitolisant alleviates brain network dysfunction and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor (H<sub>3</sub>R) antagonists regulate histamine release that modulates neuronal activity and cognitive function. Although H<sub>3</sub>R is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, whether H<sub>3</sub>R antagonists can rescue AD-associated neural impairments and cognitive deficits remains unknown. Pitolisant is a clinically approved H<sub>3</sub>R antagonist/inverse agonist that treats narcolepsy. Here, we find that pitolisant reverses AD-like pathophysiology and cognitive impairments in an AD mouse model. Behavioral assays and in vivo wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed that recognition memory, learning flexibility, and slow-wave impairment were all improved following the 15-day pitolisant treatment. Improved recognition memory was tightly correlated with slow-wave coherence, suggesting slow waves serve as a biomarker for treatment response and for AD drug screening. Furthermore, pitolisant reduced amyloid-β deposition and dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques, and enhanced neuronal lysosomal activity, inhibiting which blocked cognitive and slow-wave restoration. Our findings identify pitolisant as a potential therapeutic agent for AD treatments.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
39879633,Plasma phosphorylated tau217 strongly associates with memory deficits in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.,"Plasma phosphorylated tau biomarkers open unprecedented opportunities for identifying carriers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in early disease stages using minimally invasive techniques. Plasma p-tau biomarkers are believed to reflect tau phosphorylation and secretion. However, it remains unclear to what extent the magnitude of plasma p-tau abnormalities reflects neuronal network disturbance in the form of cognitive impairment. To address this question, we included 103 cognitively unimpaired elderly and 40 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive individuals from the TRIAD cohort, as well as 336 cognitively unimpaired and 216 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive older adults from the BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants had tau PET scans, amyloid PET scans or amyloid CSF, p-tau217, p-tau181 and p-tau231 blood measures, structural T1-MRI and cognitive assessments. In this cross-sectional study, we used regression models and correlation analyses to assess the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores. Furthermore, we applied receiver operating characteristic curves to assess cognitive impairment across plasma biomarkers. Finally, we categorized participants into amyloid (A), p-tau (T1), and tau PET (T2) positive (+) or negative (-) profiles and ran nonparametric comparisons to assess differences across cognitive domains. We found that plasma p-tau217 was more associated with cognitive performance than p-tau181 and p-tau231, and that this relationship was particularly strong for memory scores (TRIAD: βp-tau217=-0.53; βp-tau181=-0.35; βp-tau231=-0.24; BioFINDER-2: βp-tau217=-0.52; βp-tau181=-0.24; βp-tau231=-0.29). Associations in amyloid-β positive participants resembled these results, but other cognitive scores also showed strong associations in cognitively impaired individuals. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 and plasma p-tau231 in identifying memory impairment (Area Under the Curve values for TRIAD: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.77, p-tau231=0.75; Area Under the Curve values for BioFINDER-2: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.81), and in identifying executive function impairment only in the BioFINDER-2 cohort (p-tau217=0.82, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.76). Lastly, we showed that subtle memory deficits were present in A+T1+T2- participants for plasma p-tau217 (p=0.007) and plasma p-tau181 (p=0.01) in the TRIAD cohort, and for all biomarkers across cognitive domains in A+T1-T2- and A+T1+T2- individuals (p<0.001 in all) in the BioFINDER-2 cohort. A+T1+T2+ individuals showed cognitive deficits in both cohorts (p<0.001 in all). Together, our results suggest that plasma p-tau217 stands out as a biomarker capable of identifying memory deficits due to Alzheimer's disease and that memory impairment certainly occurs in amyloid and plasma p-tau positive individuals that have no significant amounts of tau in the neocortex.",Brain,2025
40161268,Targeting necroptosis in Alzheimer's disease: can exercise modulate neuronal death?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal degeneration. Emerging evidence implicates necroptosis in AD pathogenesis, driven by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL pathway, which promotes neuronal damage, inflammation, and disease progression. Exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, can modulate key inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, HMGB1, and IL-1β, thereby inhibiting necroptotic signaling. Additionally, exercise enhances O-GlcNAc glycosylation, preventing Tau hyperphosphorylation and stabilizing neuronal integrity. This review explores how exercise mitigates necroptosis and neuroinflammation, offering novel therapeutic perspectives for AD prevention and management.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39814937,DeepDrug as an expert guided and AI driven drug repurposing methodology for selecting the lead combination of drugs for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) significantly aggravates human dignity and quality of life. While newly approved amyloid immunotherapy has been reported, effective AD drugs remain to be identified. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven drug-repurposing method, DeepDrug, to identify a lead combination of approved drugs to treat AD patients. DeepDrug advances drug-repurposing methodology in four aspects. Firstly, it incorporates expert knowledge to extend candidate targets to include long genes, immunological and aging pathways, and somatic mutation markers that are associated with AD. Secondly, it incorporates a signed directed heterogeneous biomedical graph encompassing a rich set of nodes and edges, and node/edge weighting to capture crucial pathways associated with AD. Thirdly, it encodes the weighted biomedical graph through a Graph Neural Network into a new embedding space to capture the granular relationships across different nodes. Fourthly, it systematically selects the high-order drug combinations via diminishing return-based thresholds. A five-drug lead combination, consisting of Tofacitinib, Niraparib, Baricitinib, Empagliflozin, and Doxercalciferol, has been selected from the top drug candidates based on DeepDrug scores to achieve the maximum synergistic effect. These five drugs target neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glucose metabolism, which are all related to AD pathology. DeepDrug offers a novel AI-and-big-data, expert-guided mechanism for new drug combination discovery and drug-repurposing across AD and other neuro-degenerative diseases, with immediate clinical applications.",Sci Rep,2025
39931229,Untargeted urine metabolomics reveals dynamic metabolic differences and key biomarkers across different stages of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often serving as its precursor stage. Early intervention at the MCI stage can significantly delay AD onset.
METHODS: This study employed untargeted urine metabolomics, with data obtained from the MetaboLights database (MTBLS8662), combined with orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to examine metabolic differences across different stages of AD progression. A decision tree approach was used to identify key metabolites within significantly enriched pathways. These key metabolites were then utilized to construct and validate an AD progression prediction model.
RESULTS: The OPLS-DA model effectively distinguished the metabolic characteristics at different stages. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that Drug metabolism was significantly enriched across all stages, while Retinol metabolism was particularly prominent during the transition stages. Key metabolites such as Theophylline, Vanillylmandelic Acid (VMA), and Adenosine showed significant differencesdifferencesin the early stages of the disease, whereas 1,7-Dimethyluric Acid, Cystathionine, and Indole exhibited strong predictive value during the MCI to AD transition. These metabolites play a crucial role in monitoring AD progression. Predictive models based on these metabolites demonstrated excellent classification and prediction capabilities.
CONCLUSION: This study systematically analyzed the dynamic metabolic differences during the progression of AD and identified key metabolites and pathways as potential biomarkers for early prediction and intervention. Utilizing urinary metabolomics, the findings provide a theoretical basis for monitoring AD progression and contribute to improving prevention and intervention strategies, thereby potentially delaying disease progression.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39711543,Single-Nucleus Atlas of Cell-Type Specific Genetic Regulation in the Human Brain.,"Genetic risk variants for common diseases are predominantly located in non-coding regulatory regions and modulate gene expression. Although bulk tissue studies have elucidated shared mechanisms of regulatory and disease-associated genetics, the cellular specificity of these mechanisms remains largely unexplored. This study presents a comprehensive single-nucleus multi-ancestry atlas of genetic regulation of gene expression in the human prefrontal cortex, comprising 5.6 million nuclei from 1,384 donors of diverse ancestries. Through multi-resolution analyses spanning eight major cell classes and 27 subclasses, we identify genetic regulation for 14,258 genes, with 857 showing cell type-specific regulatory effects at the class level and 981 at the subclass level. Colocalization of genetic variants associated with gene regulation and disease traits uncovers novel cell type-specific genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders, which were not detectable in bulk tissue analyses. Analysis of dynamic genetic regulation at the single nucleus level identifies 2,073 genes with regulatory effects that vary across developmental trajectories, inferred from a broad age range of donors. We also uncover 1,655 genes with trans-regulatory effects, revealing distal regulation of gene expression. This high-resolution atlas provides unprecedented insight into the cell type-specific regulatory architecture of the human brain, and offers novel mechanistic targets for understanding the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.",Res Sq,2024
40122980,Generalizability of trial criteria on amyloid-lowering therapy against Alzheimer's disease to individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease in the general population.,"Treatment with anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies slowed cognitive decline in recent RCTs in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, stringent trial eligibility criteria may affect generalisability to clinical practice. We extracted eligibility criteria for trials of aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab, and applied these to participants with MCI and early clinical AD dementia from the population-based Rotterdam Study. Participants underwent questionnaires, genotyping, brain-MRI, cognitive testing, and cardiovascular assessment. We determined amyloid status using a validated prediction model based on age and APOE-genotype. Of 968 participants (mean age: 75 years, 56% women), 779 had MCI and 189 dementia. Across trials, around 40% of participants would be ineligible because of predicted amyloid negativity. At least one clinical exclusion criterion was present in 76.3% of participants for aducanumab, 75.8% for lecanemab, and 59.8% for donanemab. Common criteria were cardiovascular disease (35.2%), anticoagulant (31.2%), psychotropic or immunological medication use (20.4%), anxiety or depression (15.9%), or lack of social support (15.6%). One-third were ineligible based on brain-MRI findings alone, similar across trials and predominantly due to cerebral small-vessel disease. Combining amyloid, clinical, and imaging criteria, eligibility ranged from 9% (95% CI:7.0-11.1) for aducanumab, 8% (6.2-9.9) lecanemab to 15% (12.4-17.5) for donanemab. Findings from recent RCTs reporting protective effects of monoclonal antibodies against amyloid-β are applicable to less than 15% of community-dwelling individuals with MCI or early AD. These findings underline that evidence for drug efficacy and safety is lacking for the vast majority of patients with MCI/AD in routine clinical practice.",Eur J Epidemiol,2025
39699026,Cognitive function and its longitudinal predictability by intensity of physical activity in Chinese middle-aged and older adults.,"BACKGROUND: The aging population faces several health problems, including cognitive decline that can progress to Alzheimer's disease. Regular physical activity is widely recognized for its extensive benefits, including physical and mental health improvements especially for older adults.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the prediction of physical activity intensities on cognitive function of older adults.
METHODS: Data from 8 years prospective survey among Chinese population aged 45 years and older is used. Cognitive function was measured by word recall, orientation, numeric subtraction, and copying a picture. Physical activity was assessed with three intensity levels. General estimating equations (GEE) with unstructured correlation matrix is used to test the prediction of physical activity intensity on cognitive function.
RESULTS: Cognitive function of participants significantly declined from 9.81 at baseline to 8.81 after 8 years. Moderate-intensity physical activity for 3 days/week was strongest positive predictor of cognitive function with a betta coefficient of 0.64. Light-intensity physical activity also positively predicted cognitive function, however vigorous physical activity for more than 3 days/week negatively predicted cognitive function.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function of the Chinese population is found to continuously decline after 60 years old age. Fortunately, this decline can be delayed with age-tolerable light to moderate-intensity physical activities.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40193924,Infratentorial Cerebral Microbleeds and Incident Dementia: The ARIC-Neurocognitive Study (P11-13.015).,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of infratentorial cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and incident dementia.
BACKGROUND: Subcortical CMBs are common in older adults and linked to hypertensive small vessel disease. Infratentorial CMBs are similarly associated with hypertension, but their importance regarding dementia risk is less clear. This study investigates the impact of infratentorial CMBs on incident dementia in the community-based, longitudinal Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS).
DESIGN/METHODS: Participants (aged 67-90) without intracerebral hemorrhage or dementia (in 2011-13) were included. CMBs were identified and categorized by location from T2*GRE sequences as follows: subcortical, infratentorial, and lobar CMBs, and superficial siderosis. Incident dementia diagnoses were determined through in-person cognitive testing, informant interviews, and hospital records. Cox proportional-hazards models assessed the association between infratentorial CMB presence (vs absence) and frequency (regardless of other concurrent CMB type), each with incident dementia through 2021. Models adjusted for demographics, vascular risk factors, and other imaging markers of small vessel disease.
RESULTS: Among 1574 participants, 303 had CMBs. 69 of these had at least one infratentorial CMB. The presence of infratentorial compared to no infratentorial CMBs was associated with incident dementia in demographic- and vascular risk factor-adjusted models (HR 1.72 [95% CI 1.16-2.55]) but was attenuated after additional adjustment for white matter hyperintensities (HR 1.45 [95% CI 0.97-2.17]). Compared to those with no infratentorial CMBs, the risk of dementia was nonsignificantly elevated in participants with 1 infratentorial CMB (adjusted HR 1.34 (0.83, 2.14) but significantly elevated in those with ≥2 infratentorial CMBs (HR 2.13 [95% CI 1.10-4.11]), compared to individuals with no infratentorial CMBs .
CONCLUSIONS: A greater number of infratentorial CMBs is associated with an increased risk of incident dementia in this community-based cohort. Future studies should evaluate the potential etiology of this association and how infratentorial CMBs in combination with other CMB patterns may alter dementia risk.

A subset of cognitively normal individuals have amyloid deposition (Preclinical AD) but no current assessment can identify these individuals in the absence of expensive biomarkers.ObjectiveWe examined differences in Cognivue Clarity performance between amyloid positive and amyloid negative individuals and whether Cognivue Clarity could differentiate True Controls (cognitively normal/amyloid negative), Preclinical AD (cognitively normal/amyloid positive), and MCI due to AD (MCI-AD, cognitively impaired/amyloid positive).MethodsCognivue Clarity was administered to all participants in the Bio-Hermes Study who also had amyloid PET and blood-based biomarkers. Performance was compared between biomarker-defined groups: True Controls (n = 297), Preclinical AD (n = 95), and MCI-AD (n = 113).ResultsCognivue Clarity global scores distinguished amyloid positive individuals from amyloid negative individuals (p &lt; 0.001) and differentiated True Controls versus Preclinical AD (p = 0.014) and Preclinical AD versus MCI-AD (p &lt; 0.001). Three subtests [Shape Discrimination (p = 0.004), Visual Salience (p = 0.008), Adaptive Motor Control (p = 0.004)] and the 3-test mean (p &lt; 0.001) differentiated True Controls from Preclinical AD. The 3-test composite correlated with Amyloid PET (r = -0.433) and pTau217 (r = -0.400). The 3-test mean identified Preclinical AD in both White and Black participants.ConclusionsCognivue Clarity, a 10-min computerized battery, screens for individuals with cognitive impairment, characterizes amyloid positive individuals, and identifies Preclinical AD. This has great potential as a cost- and time-effective strategy to screen and enroll in AD prevention trials.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39948603,Plasma Hepcidin as a potential informative biomarker of Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Blood-based assays are expected to be integrated into clinical routines across various contexts, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular dementia (VaD), which is the second most common cause leading to dementia after AD, could also significantly benefit from this advancement. However, no informative fluid biomarker has been identified for VaD. Given the disruption of iron homeostasis in both AD and VaD, this study aims to characterize the potential of the iron-related hormone Hepcidin as a biomarker for these two conditions. We will compare its added value to established AT(N) blood biomarkers.
METHODS: Blood biomarkers (amyloid-composite, p-Tau<sub>181</sub>, Neurofilament Light Chain [NfL] and Hepcidin) levels in blood were analyzed in two independent cohorts and compared between AD patients and non-AD individuals. Additionally, blood Hepcidin and NfL were evaluated in the contexts of VaD and CADASIL, with their relative diagnostic value assessed.
RESULTS: Blood Hepcidin and NfL do not significantly increase the AUC obtained with both p-Tau<sub>181</sub> and amyloid composite in the context of AD. In contrast, AUC for VaD diagnosis is significantly higher when combining these two blood biomarkers compared to NfL alone. Hepcidin was not significantly modified in CADASIL patients compared to control subjects.
CONCLUSION: Blood Hepcidin and NfL have limited interest in the clinical context of AD but determination of these biomarkers shows to be highly informative for the diagnosis of VaD. This result could have important implications for diagnosis and implementation of clinical trials.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40110691,"Fibrillar tau alters cerebral endothelial cell metabolism, vascular inflammatory activation, and barrier function in vitro and in vivo.","INTRODUCTION: The presence of tau aggregates in and around the brain vasculature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies suggests its possible pathogenicity to cerebral endothelial cells (ECs).
METHODS: We used an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to understand the mechanisms of fibrillar tau-mediated cerebral EC and BBB pathology, confirming our findings in 3-month-old P301S mice brains and extracted microvessels.
RESULTS: Protofibrillar and fibrillar tau species induce endothelial barrier permeability through an increase in glycolysis, which activates ECs toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, inducing loss of junction protein expression and localization. The Warburg-like metabolic shift toward glycolysis and increased vascular pathological phenotypes are also present in young P301S mice.
DISCUSSION: In sum, our work reveals that fibrillar tau species, by enhancing endothelial glycolytic metabolism, promote vascular inflammatory phenotypes and loss of BBB function, highlighting the importance of addressing and targeting early tau-mediated neurovascular damage in AD and tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: We improve the understanding of the mechanisms of vascular pathology in tauopathies. Fibrillar tau mediates vascular metabolic changes, inflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. These events are replicated at early stages in a tauopathy mouse model. Inhibiting altered glycolysis reduces BBB permeability and endothelial activation.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

The mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (mcSUVR) was derived from amyloid positron emission tomography, while the percentage of WML area relative to brain parenchymal area was determined using magnetic resonance imaging.

40194132,Safety and Efficacy of Monoclonal Anti-Tau Antibody in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (P12-3.002).,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies in treating Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
BACKGROUND: AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, leading to cognitive and behavioral impairment. Although no cure exists, monoclonal antibodies have been developed as potential therapies. Initially, treatments targeted beta-amyloid, but more recent approaches focus on tau pathology.
DESIGN/METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing anti-tau monoclonal antibodies to placebo in AD patients. The efficacy outcomes were the change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) in the overall population and early-stage AD, and the reduction of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Safety outcomes included adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and discontinuation rates.
RESULTS: After screening 528 articles, 6 RCTs comprising 2145 participants (56.1% female) were included. No significant difference was observed in CDR-SB changes for all AD patients (Mean Difference [MD] 0.121; 95% CI -0.10-0.33; p=0.28; I<sup>2</sup>=0%) or early-stage AD (MD 0.095; 95% CI -0.14-0.33; p=0.42; I<sup>2</sup>=0%). CSF tau levels were significantly reduced in the intervention group. Anti-tau therapies did not increase the risk of any AE (Relative Risk [RR] 1.01; 95% CI 0.96-1.05; p=0.77; I<sup>2</sup>=46%), serious AEs, nor did they lead to higher discontinuation rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not demonstrate a therapeutic benefit of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies in slowing disease progression as measured by CDR-SB, although they showed no increased risk of adverse events and are a safe therapy.

40194440,Tau Protein Mediates the Association of Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease with Cognitive Decline (P6-14.010).,"OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the interrelationships among ICVD, AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cognition.
BACKGROUND: Patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke demonstrate an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) may interact with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology to promote dementia onset. However, the precise pathological mechanisms through which ICVD impacts cognition remain to be fully characterized.
DESIGN/METHODS: A total of 2524 participants were recruited from the CABLE study. ICVD group referred to those with TIA or ischemic stroke. Cognitive performance was assessed by the China Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (CM-MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-b (MoCA-b). Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of ICVD with CSF AD biomarkers and cognition. Causal mediation analyses were used to identify whether the association was mediated by AD pathology.
RESULTS: TIA/ischemic stroke was associated with higher CSF total-tau (t-tau) (β = 0.205, p = 2.828×10<sup>-2</sup>) and poorer cognition (CM-MMSE: β = -0.299, p = 1.539×10<sup>-5</sup>; MoCA-b: β = -0.324, p = 4.552×10<sup>-6</sup>). The influence of TIA/ischemic stroke on cognitive function was partially mediated by CSF t-tau (CM-MMSE: p = 0.030, proportion: 2.74%; MoCA-b: p = 0.037, proportion: 2.51%). Subgroup analyses revealed the influences of CSF t-tau were especially evident in the male (CM-MMSE: p = 0.006, proportion: 5.45%; MoCA-b: p = 0.015, proportion: 5.38%) and mid-life group (CM-MMSE: p = 0.006, proportion: 9.83%; MoCA-b: p = 0.051, proportion: 5.31%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results delineated tau pathology as a pivotal mediator for the influence of ICVD on cognition. Our findings indicate that the influence may be mediated through neuronal injury rather than classic AD pathological changes. Targeting brain ischemia and alleviating neuronal injury induced by ischemia may be a promising approach for preventing or slowing cognitive decline.

39730822,Structural inequality linked to brain volume and network dynamics in aging and dementia across the Americas.,"Structural inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities, influences health outcomes. However, the biological embedding of structural inequality in aging and dementia, especially among underrepresented populations, is unclear. We examined the association between structural inequality (country-level and state-level Gini indices) and brain volume and connectivity in 2,135 healthy controls, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobe degeneration from Latin America and the United States. Greater structural inequality was linked to reduced brain volume and connectivity, with stronger effects in Latin America, especially in the temporo-cerebellar, fronto-thalamic and hippocampal regions. In the United States, milder effects were observed in the insular-cingular and temporal areas. Results were more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease and were independent of age, sex, education, cognition and other confounding factors. The findings highlight the critical role of structural inequality in aging and dementia, emphasizing the biological embedding of macrosocial factors and the need for targeted interventions in underserved populations.",Nat Aging,2025
40001102,"Increased risk of chronic diseases and multimorbidity in middle-aged and elderly individuals with early vision, hearing, or dual sensory impairments: insights from prospective cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis.","BACKGROUND: Sensory impairments (SI), including vision (VI), hearing (HI), and dual sensory impairments (DSI), are prevalent with aging, but their impact on disease risk remains unclear. This study investigates the epidemiological and genetic associations between SIs and 10 chronic disease categories and multimorbidity.
METHODS: Using the CHARLS study, participants were classified by their self-reported VI/HI/DSI status in 2011 and 2013 into groups: ""new onset, remission, persistent, and no SI."" Their chronic disease incidence was tracked until 2018 in sub-cohorts respectively. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses used genetic instruments from UK Biobank GWAS data on 88,250/504,307 individuals for vision/hearing loss, with outcome datasets from consortia including FinnGen, DIAMANTE, CKDGen, PGC, GWAS Catalog, and International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium.
RESULTS: The cohort study revealed that persistent HI significantly increased the risk of heart disease (P < 0.001, HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.31-2.03), stroke (P 0.004, HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.16-2.18), chronic lung disease (P 0.002, HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.17-1.99), and emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problems (P 0.016, HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.14-3.60). Persistent VI was significantly associated with diabetes or high blood sugar (DM/Hglu) (P 0.012, HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.11-2.38) and chronic lung disease (P 0.042, HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.02-2.31). MR confirmed these strong or suggestive associations, indicating that HI significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events by 61-170%, bronchitis by 160%, and schizophrenia by 36%. In addition, VI significantly raised the risk of hyperglycemia or diabetes by 2-4% and the risk of lung function decline. Additionally, cohort studies confirmed that early DSI significantly raised the risk of multiple diseases, while MR identified genetic links between VI and hepatic failure, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease, and between HI and hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence from epidemiological or genetic perspectives demonstrates that early exposure to HI/VI/DSI increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. These findings underscore the need for continuous monitoring and timely intervention for SI to manage chronic disease risks in aging populations.",BMC Med,2025
39938492,Structural Neuroimaging Correlates of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Literature Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as increased apathy, affective symptoms, psychosis and hyperactivity are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with increased disease severity and caregiver burden. In contrast to well-characterized associations between AD-related cognitive deficits and focal neuropathology (e.g., memory and hippocampal atrophy), fewer studies have focused on associations between NPS-brain associations in AD. Furthermore, studies focusing on magnetic resonance imaging measures of gray matter (GM) abnormalities associated with NPS in AD have not been systematically reviewed.
METHODS: To address this gap, a systematic literature review was undertaken to identify articles that assessed structural brain differences associated with NPS in AD. This review identified 29 such articles that tested associations between NPS and gray matter loss (GML: reduced GM density, reduced GM volume, decreased cortical thickness, etc.).
RESULTS: Across all NPS, most symptoms were associated with GML in the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe, highlighting key limbic/limbic adjacent structures including orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal regions. Other regions exhibiting associations included the superior and middle temporal gyri as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortex.
CONCLUSION: Understanding how GM changes in the brain relate to NPS in AD may not only improve our understanding of NPS and AD but may also provide help identify homologies/correspondence with brain changes in psychiatric diseases.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,2025
39860306,Analysis of Preventive Effect of Bisphosphonate for Osteoporotic Fracture in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Patient Mortality.,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the older adult population and is often associated with reduced physical activity. Reduced activity and mechanical loading subsequently reduce bone mineral density and increase risk of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates (BPs) offer preventative effects on osteoporotic fractures in the general population, but their effects on patients with AD are less known. This study aimed to assess the impact of BPs on osteoporotic fractures and survival in patients with AD. Methods: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, 43,469 patients from the Korea National Health Insurance Service database between 2004 and 2018 were included. All patients were diagnosed with AD and subsequently diagnosed with osteoporosis. Continuous use of BPs was defined as having prescriptions for BP medications one year after the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Propensity score matching paired 12,519 BP users with 12,518 non-users for post-fracture survival analysis. Results: Continuous use of BPs showed a significant preventative effect on the Cox regression model [hazard ratio (HR), 0.890-0.895; p &lt; 0.001] but not on the logistic regression model. The occurrence of osteoporotic fractures in the hip or spine significantly increased the risk of death [hip, HR, 2.036; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.789-2.316; p &lt; 0.001; spine, HR, 1.465; CI, 1.305-1.644; p &lt; 0.001]. Conclusions: Continuous use of BPs was associated with reduced occurrence of osteoporotic fractures in patients with AD.

39823141,Long-range inputome of prefrontal GABAergic interneurons in the Alzheimer's disease mouse.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by damage to cortical circuits. However, the mechanisms underlying AD-associated changes in long-range circuits remain poorly understood.
METHODS: In this study, we used viral tracing and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) imaging to investigate whole-brain changes in the input circuit of the frontal cortex of 5×FAD mice.
RESULTS: Pathological axonal degeneration was widely observed in upstream regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, across all AD brains examined. The proportion of input neurons projecting to parvalbumin-expressing neurons, compared to those projecting to somatostatin-expressing neurons, decreased in the hippocampus and basal forebrain. This decline was closely related to mouse age and the cell type of the presynaptic input neurons.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the selective vulnerability of long-range circuits in the prelimbic area in AD at the mesoscopic level, thereby enhancing our understanding of circuit architecture degeneration across the brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: We used whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution to generate brain-wide input maps of the Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The pathological changes in the input proportions showed relevance with the mouse age, distribution, and cell type of the presynaptic input neurons. Compared to the cell body and dendrites of the medial prefrontal cortex input neurons, the pathological changes in the axonal structure are more extensive.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40084664,Frequency of variants in Mendelian Alzheimer's disease genes within the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.,"BackgroundPrior studies examined variants within presenilin-2 (PSEN2), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. However, previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and other predicted damaging missense (DM) variants have not been characterized in a newer release of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).ObjectiveTo characterize previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and DM variants in PSEN2, PSEN1, APP within the participants from the ADSP.MethodsWe identified rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) in PSEN2, PSEN1, and APP in 14,641 individuals with whole genome sequencing and 16,849 individuals with whole exome sequencing available (N<sub>total </sub>= 31,490). We additionally curated variants from ClinVar, OMIM, and Alzforum and report carriers of variants in clinical databases as well as predicted DM variants in these genes.ResultsWe detected 31 previously-reported clinically-relevant variants with alternate alleles observed within the ADSP: 4 variants in PSEN2, 25 in PSEN1, and 2 in APP. The overall variant carrier rate for the 31 clinically-relevant variants in the ADSP was 0.3%. We observed that 79.5% of the variant carriers were cases compared to 3.9% were controls. In those with AD, the mean age of onset of AD among carriers of these clinically-relevant variants was 19.6 ± 1.4 years earlier compared with noncarriers (p = 7.8 × 10<sup>-57</sup>). Additionally, we identified 197 rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) within ADSP participants not reported in known clinical databases.ConclusionsA small proportion of individuals in the ADSP are carriers of a previously-reported clinically-relevant variant allele for AD and these participants have significantly earlier age of AD onset compared to noncarriers.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39777972,Pathological angiogenesis was associated with cerebrovascular lesion and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the specific factors driving abnormal angiogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its role in cerebrovascular lesions and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We assessed cerebrovascular pathologies, amyloid-beta (Aβ), and tau pathologies in post mortem human brains and detected 12 angiogenic factors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (CANDI) cohort.
RESULTS: We observed severe blood-brain barrier damage and elevated levels of the vascular marker CD31 in human AD brains, which had a stronger correlation with tau pathology than Aβ pathology. Consistently, only CSF pTau181 showed positive associations with CSF angiogenesis factors (soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [sVEGFR2], VEGF-C, VEGF-D, placental growth factor [PLGF], Angiopoietin2, and Serpin E1), but not CSF Aβ42/40. Additionally, higher levels of CSF sVEGFR1, soluble Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor 2 [sTIE2], PLGF, and interleukin 8 [IL8], as well as lower levels of CSF urokinase-type plasminogen activator [uPA], were associated with worsen cerebrovascular pathologies and neurodegeneration.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that tau pathology may play a critical role in pathological angiogenesis, contributing to cerebrovascular lesions and neurodegeneration in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: BBB damage and elevated vascular marker CD31 in human AD brains had a stronger correlation with tau pathology than Aβ pathology. CSF pTau181 mediated the effect of CSF Aβ42/40 on CSF sVEGFR1 and sTIE2. Only CSF pTau181 showed positive associations with sVEGFR2, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, PLGF, Angiopoietin2, and Serpin E1. Higher sVEGFR1, sTIE2, PLGF, and IL8, and lower uPA in CSF, were associated with cerebrovascular pathologies and neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39939138,Smoking-attributable neurological health loss: age-specific burden and health disparities.,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is a significant risk factor for neurological disorders, yet its global impact on these conditions remains underexplored.
METHODS: Using Global Burden of Diseases 2021 data, we analysed trends in age-standardised disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and deaths attributable to smoking from 1990 to 2021 for three neurological disorders: stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and Multiple Sclerosis. Socioeconomic disparities were assessed using the lope index of inequality and the relative concentration index. Bayesian age-period-cohort models were employed to forecast smoking-attributable burden through 2050.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2021, annual smoking-attributable DALYs and death rates slightly declined by -1.93% and -1.92%, respectively, but absolute numbers continued to rise, from 26.10 million to 30.18 million DALYs and from 0.93 million to 1.15 million deaths. Older adults (aged 60 and above) experienced the greatest burden, contributing 58.15% of DALYs and 75.57% of deaths in 2021. Smoking-attributable stroke was increasingly concentrated in low sociodemographic index regions, whereas disparities in dementias and multiple sclerosis were more pronounced in socioeconomically advantaged regions, particularly for multiple sclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified an age-specific burden and widening disparities for neurological disorders attributable to smoking, with older adults disproportionately experiencing an escalating impact. Targeted prevention and equitable healthcare access tailored for older adults are critical to mitigating smoking-attributable neurological health loss.",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,2025
39845736,Identify biological Alzheimer's disease using a novel nucleic acid-linked protein immunoassay.,"Blood-based biomarkers have been revolutionizing the detection, diagnosis and screening of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, phosphorylated-tau variants (p-tau<sub>181</sub>, p-tau<sub>217</sub> and p-tau<sub>231</sub>) are promising biomarkers for identifying Alzheimer's disease pathology. Antibody-based assays such as single molecule arrays immunoassays are powerful tools to investigate pathological changes indicated by blood-based biomarkers and have been studied extensively in the Alzheimer's disease research field. A novel proteomic technology-NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA)-was developed to improve the sensitivity of traditional proximity ligation assays and offer a comprehensive outlook for 120 protein biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the relative novelty of the NULISA technology in quantifying Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, validation through comparisons with more established methods is required. The main objective of the current study was to determine the capability of p-tau variants quantified using NULISA for identifying abnormal amyloid-β and tau pathology. We assessed 397 participants [mean (standard deviation) age, 64.8 (15.7) years; 244 females (61.5%) and 153 males (38.5%)] from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort where participants had plasma measurements of p-tau<sub>181</sub>, p-tau<sub>217</sub> and p-tau<sub>231</sub> from NULISA and single molecule arrays immunoassays. Participants also underwent neuroimaging assessments, including structural MRI, amyloid-PET and tau-PET. Our findings suggest an excellent agreement between plasma p-tau variants quantified using NULISA and single molecule arrays immunoassays. Plasma p-tau<sub>217</sub> measured with NULISA shows excellent discriminative accuracy for abnormal amyloid-PET (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.918, 95% confidence interval = 0.883 to 0.953, P &lt; 0.0001) and tau-PET (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.939; 95% confidence interval = 0.909 to 0.969, P &lt; 0.0001). It also presents the capability for differentiating tau-PET staging. Validation of the NULISA-measured plasma biomarkers adds to the current analytical methods for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, screening and staging and could potentially expedite the development of a blood-based biomarker panel.",Brain Commun,2025
40063315,Biomarker Profile in Peripheral Blood Cells Related to Alzheimer's Disease.,"In a healthy brain, neuroinflammation, controlled by the main intermediary for the immune response microglia and astrocytes, contributes to maintain physiological functions such as secretion of neurotrophic factors, removal of cell tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) debris, and local homeostasis. When the immune response becomes chronic, it can become pathological and fuel neuroinflammation, causing glial cells to malfunction and not perform their function of clearing debris, resulting in further damage to neurons. Multiple studies highlight that an intense crosstalk is activated between peripheral blood white cells (PBWCs) and central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, how PBWC can be carriers of biomarkers of the CNS neuropathological states it is still far to be completely known. In this work, we aimed to observe how PBWC content could be related to moderate-severity of DAT in order to have early signals from of pathological neurodegeneration brain initiate. Protein analysis have been performed in PBWC of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and DAT patients in respect to those of healthy controls and differently expressed proteins have been investigated. Our data showed a deregulation of pathways involved in neurodegeneration since from MCI level and deregulated proteins that can be considered markers for DAT onset and progression.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39685498,The Association Between Major Depression and Alzheimer's Disease Risk: Evidence from a 12-Year Longitudinal Study.,"Background: The relationship between depression, particularly major depression (MD), as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established; however, its precise role remains contested. Findings from the fourth wave of the ZARADEMP longitudinal study provide further insights into the association between MD and AD risk. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the association between MD and incident AD, controlling for established risk factors. Methods: The study analyzed 4803 participants, of whom 4057 were followed over a 12-year period as part of the ZARADEMP longitudinal study. Depression was assessed using the GMS-AGECAT, and dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. The association between MD and incident AD was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: The incidence of AD was approximately twice as high in participants with MD compared to those without (relative risk = 2.07; 95% CI: 0.85-5.03; p = 0.123). This risk was nearly threefold higher in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions: These findings underscore a significant association between MD and an increased risk of AD, emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring and potential early intervention among individuals diagnosed with MD.",J Clin Med,2024
39809899,Multi-omic quantitative trait loci link tandem repeat size variation to gene regulation in human brain.,"Tandem repeat (TR) size variation is implicated in ~50 neurological disorders, yet its impact on gene regulation in the human brain remains largely unknown. In the present study, we quantified the impact of TR size variation on brain gene regulation across distinct molecular phenotypes, based on 4,412 multi-omics samples from 1,597 donors, including 1,586 newly sequenced ones. We identified ~2.2 million TR molecular quantitative trait loci (TR-xQTLs), linking ~139,000 unique TRs to nearby molecular phenotypes, including many known disease-risk TRs, such as the G<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub> expansion in C9orf72 associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Fine-mapping revealed ~18,700 TRs as potential causal variants. Our in vitro experiments further confirmed the causal and independent regulatory effects of three TRs. Additional colocalization analysis indicated the potential causal role of TR variation in brain-related phenotypes, highlighted by a 3'-UTR TR in NUDT14 linked to cortical surface area and a TG repeat in PLEKHA1, associated with Alzheimer's disease.",Nat Genet,2025
40151913,Semaglutide improves cognitive function and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by activating AMPK and inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) causes cognitive function disorder and has become the preeminent cause of dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, semaglutide, have shown positive effects on promoting the cognitive function. However, research about the mechanism of semaglutide as a therapeutic intervention in AD is sparse.ObjectiveThis study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of semaglutide in a transgenic mouse model of AD pathology and explored the detailed mechanism by semaglutide modulated neuroinflammatory processes.MethodsMale amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were treated with semaglutide or vehicle for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test was used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of semaglutide on recognition function. Pathology analysis was performed to detect the deposition of amyloid plaques. High-throughput sequencing analysis was applied to specify the mechanism. Microglia and astrocyte activation were assessed with immunofluorescent staining. Inflammation cytokine levels were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Related proteins and pathway were evaluated with western blot.ResultsSemaglutide treatment attenuated Aβ accumulation and enhanced cognitive function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Through transcriptomic profiling, immunohistochemical staining, and ELISA, semaglutide was substantiated to inhibit the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, as well as to curtail the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, semaglutide robustly activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling cascade, thus reducing the Aβ deposition and dampening the inflammatory cascade.ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that semaglutide mitigated neuroinflammation and decelerated the advance of AD in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39703326,Evaluating clinical meaningfulness of anti-β-amyloid therapies amidst amyloid-related imaging abnormalities concern in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly, which is clinically characterized by a gradual and progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. The central and early role of β-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is supported by a plethora of studies including genetic analyses, biomarker research and genome-wide association studies in both familial (early-onset) and sporadic (late-onset) forms of Alzheimer's. Monoclonal antibodies directed against β-amyloid demonstrate slowing of the clinical deterioration of patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab clinical trials showed slowing of Alzheimer's disease progression on composite scores by 25-40% based on the measure used. Anti-β-amyloid antibodies can cause side effects of bleeding and swelling in the brain, called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities typically occur early in treatment and are often asymptomatic, and though in rare cases, they can lead to serious or life-threatening events. The aim of this review is to evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of anti-β-amyloid therapies amidst amyloid-related imaging abnormalities concern in Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun,2024
40043125,Associations between hormone therapy use and tau accumulation in brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease.,"Elucidating the downstream impact of exogenous hormones on the aging brain will have far-reaching consequences for understanding why Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominates in women almost twofold over men. We tested the extent to which menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use is associated with later-life amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau accumulation using PET on N = 146 baseline clinically normal women, aged 51 to 89 years. Women were scanned over a 4.5-year (SD, 2.1; range, 1.3 to 10.4) and 3.5-year (SD, 1.5; range, 1.2 to 8.1) period for Aβ and tau, respectively, ~14 years after the initiation of HT. In older women (aged &gt;70 years), HT users exhibited faster regional tau accumulation relative to non-users, localized to the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, with an indirect effect of HT on cognitive decline through regional tau accumulation. In younger women (aged &lt;70 years), HT associations with tau accumulation were negligible. Findings are relevant for optimizing menopausal treatment guidelines.",Sci Adv,2025
39870615,"Splicing accuracy varies across human introns, tissues, age and disease.","Alternative splicing impacts most multi-exonic human genes. Inaccuracies during this process may have an important role in ageing and disease. Here, we investigate splicing accuracy using RNA-sequencing data from >14k control samples and 40 human body sites, focusing on split reads partially mapping to known transcripts in annotation. We show that splicing inaccuracies occur at different rates across introns and tissues and are affected by the abundance of core components of the spliceosome assembly and its regulators. We find that age is positively correlated with a global decline in splicing fidelity, mostly affecting genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We find support for the latter by observing a genome-wide increase in splicing inaccuracies in samples affected with Alzheimer's disease as compared to neurologically normal individuals. In this work, we provide an in-depth characterisation of splicing accuracy, with implications for our understanding of the role of inaccuracies in ageing and neurodegenerative disorders.",Nat Commun,2025
39686610,Factors influencing rates of unsupervised assessment of short-term learning in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"BACKGROUND: In older adults with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), learning curves derived from validated psychological learning paradigms are reduced to an extent greater than impairment, or decline, on neuropsychological memory tests.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine how age, sex, education, mood, and general dementia risk, which also increases risk for preclinical AD, could influence learning curves.
METHODS: 1050 adults enrolled in the BetterBrains trial completed 10 blocks of ORCA-LLT learning trials over 5 days. Learning curves were derived from improvement in accuracy over trials. Participants also completed questionnaires of demography and mood, and the CAIDE risk score was computed for each participant.
RESULTS: Most participants (67%) completed ≥6 blocks of ORCA-LLT. Older age (d = 0.75), lower education (d = 0.50), and higher dementia risk (d = 0.36) were associated significantly with slower learning rates.
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, learning curves are influenced subtly by age, education, and dementia risk but not by sex or mood.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39767824,Safety Concerns in Neurological Clinical Trials: A Challenge That the FDA Must Resolve.,"Background: Monoclonal antibodies approved by the FDA, lecanemab, donanemab, and aducanumab, are failing to meet the expected efficacy to treat early Alzheimer's disease, and aducanumab has been recalled. Methods: Recently, it was reported that the clinical trials of these antibodies may have violated patient's rights and subjected them to high, likely lethal risk. The challenge with developing antibodies to treat neurological disorders is their poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration if the antibody must enter the brain, resulting in almost negligible brain bioavailability, requiring high dosing that can be toxic. Results: The reported efficacy of these drugs should also be reviewed, considering the placebo effects, since all antibodies have shown severe side effects that are not prevented by the placebo responses. In this critical and urgent advice to the FDA, I am suggesting a guideline amendment to all clinical trials requiring proof of sufficient brain bioavailability at the site of action, where it is known. Conclusions: For antibodies to cross the blood-brain barrier, there are proven options such as conjugating with transferrin protein, making clinical trials in its absence more questionable.",Biomedicines,2024
40065072,Subcellular proteomics and iPSC modeling uncover reversible mechanisms of axonal pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Dystrophic neurites (also termed axonal spheroids) are found around amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where they impair axonal electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits and correlate with AD severity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids correlated with AD severity in humans. Notably, mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.",Nat Aging,2025
39761259,The MIR-NAT MAPT-AS1 does not regulate Tau expression in human neurons.,"The MAPT gene encodes Tau protein, a member of the large family of microtubule-associated proteins. Tau forms large insoluble aggregates that are toxic to neurons in several neurological disorders, and neurofibrillary Tau tangles represent a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Lowering Tau expression levels constitutes a potential treatment for AD but the mechanisms that regulate Tau expression at the transcriptional or translational level are not well understood. Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are a particular class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can regulate expression of their overlapping protein-coding genes at the epigenetic, transcriptional, or translational level. We and others identified a long non-coding RNA associated with the MAPT gene, named MAPT antisense 1 (MAPT-AS1). We confirmed that MAPT-AS1 is expressed in neurons in human post mortem brain tissue. To study the role of MAPT-AS1 on MAPT expression regulation, we modulated the expression of this lncRNA in human neuroblastoma cell lines and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons. In contrast to previous reports, we observed no changes on MAPT mRNA or Tau protein levels upon modulation of MAPT-AS1 levels in these cellular models. Our data suggest that MAPT-AS1 does not regulate Tau expression levels in human neurons in vitro. Thus, MAPT-AS1 does not represent a valuable therapeutic target to lower Tau expression in patients affected by tauopathies including AD.",PLoS One,2025
40019008,The tau isoform 1N4R confers vulnerability of MAPT knockout human iPSC-derived neurons to amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau-induced neuronal dysfunction.,"INTRODUCTION: Human tau protein, composed of six brain-specific isoforms, is a major driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of its isoforms however remains unclear and human AD models are scarce.
METHODS: We generated human MAPT- (tau-) knockout (KO) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using CRISPR/Cas9, differentiated these into glutamatergic neurons, and assessed isoform-specific functions of tau in these neurons. We used omic- approaches, live-cell imaging, subcompartmental analysis, and lentivirus-based reintroduction of specific tau isoforms to investigate isoform-mediated neuronal dysfunction in an AD model.
RESULTS: Tau KO human iPSC-derived neurons showed decreased neurite outgrowth and axon initial segment length and, notably, resisted amyloid beta oligomer (AβO)-induced neuronal activity reduction. Introducing the 1N4R-tau isoform, but not other isoforms, confers AβO vulnerability and increases KxGS phosphorylation of tau, without altering neuronal activity or microtubule modifications.
DISCUSSION: While tau KO impacts neuronal development and activity, tau-KO also confers resistance against AβO insult. 1N4R-tau likely mediates AβO-induced and phosphorylated tau toxicity, representing a novel prime therapeutic target for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau knockout alters neurite growth and axon initial segment formation in human neurons. Tau isoforms show differential axonal localization in human neurons. Tau depletion protects against amyloid beta oligomer (AβO)-mediated neurotoxicity. 1N4R tau mediates AβO-induced toxicity in human neurons.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40110659,Connectome-based predictive modeling of brain pathology and cognition in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) through genetic mutations can result in near complete expression of the disease. Tracking AD pathology development in an ADAD cohort of Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) E280A carriers' mutation has allowed us to observe incipient tau tangles accumulation as early as 6 years prior to symptom onset.
METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans were acquired in a group of PSEN1 carriers (n = 32) and non-carrier family members (n = 35). We applied connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to examine the relationship between the participant's functional connectome and their respective tau/amyloid-β levels and cognitive scores (word list recall).
RESULTS: CPM models strongly predicted tau concentrations and cognitive scores within the carrier group. The connectivity patterns between the temporal cortex, default mode network, and other memory networks were the most informative of tau burden.
DISCUSSION: These results indicate that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods can complement PET methods in early detection and monitoring of disease progression in ADAD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Connectivity-based predictive modeling of tau and amyloid-β in ADAD carriers. Strong predictions for tau deposition; weaker predictions for amyloid-β. Cognitive scores for memory and mental state are predicted strongly. Connectivity between IPL, DAN, DMN, temporal cortex most predictive.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39911310,Tablet-based self assessment memory scale-revised (SAMS-R) evaluates memory functions for older adults.,"BACKGROUND: The demand for more accurate and early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased after disease-modifying drugs were launched. Among these needs, there is a requirement for tools that can easily assess the ability to recall memories, which changes early in the disease.
OBJECTIVES: We established Self Assessment Memory Scale (SAMS) method before, which includes 8-picture recall test and 16-word recognition test. We adopted this method to software that can be operated on a tablet computer so that participants can perform the method independently. The purpose of this study was to validate this method.
DESIGN: Cross sectional research.
SETTING: Some of the participants were recruited from hospitals for patients diagnosed with AD or MCI. The others were recruited from three regional cohorts of healthy older adults.
PARTICIPANTS: The total number of participants was 304 (20 of whom had AD or MCI), and the mean age was 71.2 years. 64% of the participants were women.
MEASUREMENTS: We used the logical memory subtest of the WMS-R as the standard for memory evaluation and assessed the relationship between this score and the SAMS score calculated by the software.
RESULTS: The 2nd SAMS score were higher than the 1st SAMS score in some participants, on the other hand, the intraclass correlation coefficient was good. Since the number of false recognition in the 16-word recognition test was higher in participants with lower LM II scores, we developed a new score to reflect the ratio of false recognition, SAMS-R, and we observed it has good correlation with LM II. The mean SAMS-R score decreased gradually after the age of 65 years, indicating that age-related changes in memory recall can be detected. The ROC curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the detectability to determine whether if the WMS-R LM II score is above or below 10, showing that the AUC was greater than 0.9.
CONCLUSION: SAMS-R, which can be performed on a tablet literally by himself/herself independently, shows a high correlation with the WMS-R Logical Memory II score, and has the advantage of being performed in a short time without the need for a clinical psychologist or other personnel.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40016780,HCN2 deficiency correlates with memory deficits and hyperexcitability of dCA1 pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal excitability of hippocampal neurons may lead to dysfunction of neural circuits and then causes cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
METHODS: Electrophysiology was performed to examine the intrinsic excitability of CA1 neurons and the activity of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCNs) of CA1 neurons in wild type (WT) and hAPP-J20 mice. The activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) was modulated with chemogenetics. The activity of HCNs was regulated with nonselective facilitator (cAMP) or inhibitor (ZD7288) of HCNs. Immunohistochemical staining or western blotting were performed to examine the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 in the hippocampus of WT and hAPP-J20 mice, or AD patients and non-AD controls. AAVs were injected to specifically modulate the expression of HCN2 in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) PNs. Cognitive performance of mice was assessed with behavioral tests.
RESULTS: dCA1 PNs were more excitable in hAPP-J20 mice, but the excitability of PNs in the ventral CA1 (vCA1) or PV neurons was comparable between WT and hAPP-J20 mice. The activity of the HCNs was reduced in dCA1 PNs of hAPP-J20 mice, and pharmacologically increasing the activity of HCNs attenuated the hyperexcitability of dCA1 PNs in hAPP-J20 mice, suggesting that the reduced activity of HCNs is associated with the hyperexcitability of dCA1 PNs in hAPP-J20 mice. The expression of HCN2 but not HCN1 was reduced in the hippocampus of hAPP-J20 mice, and the expression of HCN2 was also reduced in the hippocampus of AD patients, suggesting that dysregulation of HCN2 is associated with the reduced activity of HCNs in AD. Overexpressing HCN2 rescued the activity of HCNs, attenuated the hyperexcitability of dCA1 PNs and improved memory of hAPP-J20 mice, and knocking down HCN2 impaired the function of HCNs, increased the excitability of dCA1 PNs and led to memory deficits in WT mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dysregulation of HCNs, particularly HCN2, contributes to the abnormal excitability of CA1 PNs in AD mice and probably in AD patients as well, and thus provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the aberrant activity or excitability of hippocampal neurons in AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40145464,Heterogeneous brain abnormalities in subjective cognitive decline converge on a common network and their transcriptional signature.,"INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is increasingly recognized as closely related to future Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous neuroimaging findings in SCD are inconsistent. We tested whether the various findings localize to a common brain network.
METHODS: Using a novel coordinate network mapping approach, we delineated common brain damage networks that were functionally connected to reported neuroimaging findings. We then decoded these common networks using microscale transcriptomic and chemo-architectures and psychological processes.
RESULTS: We enrolled 45 studies comprising 2453 SCD patients and 3017 healthy controls. The identified SCD networks were largely localized in the somatosensory network (SMN) and default mode network (DMN). Both were robust to perturbations of analyzed parameters and in an independent validation dataset. Neurobiology correlation analyses identified some key biological pathways and neurotransmitters linked to these networks.
DISCUSSION: Our findings reconcile heterogeneous neuroimaging abnormalities in SCD and provide a richer neurobiological underpinning, which has implications for understanding patients with SCD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The heterogeneous neuroimaging findings on SCD were reconciled in a coordinate network mapping framework. The SCD-related functional network involves changes in the DMN, while the SCD-related structural network has changes mainly in primary sensory areas.

39994806,<sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 tau PET in patients at-risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Molecular biomarkers of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are lacking. We evaluated <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 tau PET as a biomarker for CTE. Two studies were done: (1) <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 autoradiography and an in-vitro brain homogenate binding studies on postmortem CTE tissue, (2) an in-vivo <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 tau PET study in former American football players.
METHODS: Autoradiography and in-vitro binding studies were done using <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 on frozen temporal and frontal cortex tissue from six autopsy cases with stage III CTE compared to Alzheimer's disease. Thirty male former National Football League (NFL) players with cognitive concerns (mean age = 58.9, SD = 7.8) completed tau (<sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240) and Aβ (<sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir) PET. Controls included 39 Aβ-PET negative, cognitively normal males (mean age = 65.7, SD = 6.3). <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 SUVr images were created using 70-90 min post-injection data with inferior cerebellar gray matter as the reference. We compared SUVr between players and controls using voxelwise and region-of-interest approaches. Correlations between <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 SUVr and cognitive scores were tested.
RESULTS: All six CTE stage III cases had Braak NFT stage III but no neuritic plaques. Two had Thal Phase 1 for Aβ; one showed a laminar pattern of <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 autoradiography binding in the superior temporal cortex and less so in the dorsolateral frontal cortex, corresponding to tau-immunoreactive lesions detected using the AT8 antibody (pSer202/pThr205 tau) in adjacent tissue sections. The other CTE cases had low frequencies of cortical tau-immunoreactive deposits and no well-defined autoradiography binding. In-vitro <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 binding studies to CTE brain homogenates in the case with autoradiography signal indicated high binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.0 ± 0.9 nM, B<sub>max</sub> = 97 ± 24 nM, n = 3). All NFL players had negative Aβ-PET. There was variable, low-to-intermediate intensity <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 uptake across participants: 16 had no cortical signal, 7 had medial temporal lobe (MTL) uptake, 2 had frontal uptake, and 4 had MTL and frontal uptake. NFL players had higher SUVr in the entorhinal cortex (d = 0.86, p = 0.001), and the parahippocampal gyrus (d = 0.39, p = 0.08). Voxelwise regressions showed increased uptake in NFL players in two bilateral anterior MTL clusters (p &lt; 0.05 FWE). Higher parahippocampal and frontal-temporal SUVrs correlated with worse memory (r = -0.38, r = -0.40) and semantic fluency (r = -0.38, r = -0.48), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We present evidence of <sup>3</sup>H-MK-6240 in-vitro binding to post-mortem CTE tissue homogenates and in vivo <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 PET binding in the MTL among a subset of participants. Additional studies in larger samples and PET-to-autopsy correlations are required to further elucidate the potential of <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 to detect tau pathology in CTE.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40188075,Dietary diversity and cognitive performance in older adults: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Promoting dietary diversity (DD), which refers to the variety or the number of different food groups that people eat over the time given, is important for brain health maintenance and may be beneficial for inhibiting neurodegenerative diseases. This research aimed to review the literature and summarize research evidence for achieving an inclusive estimate concerning the relationship between DD and cognitive function in adults.
METHODS: We systematically queried the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, without imposing any date restrictions, up to June 2024 to identify original literature that sheds light on the intricate relationship between DD and cognitive function. Employing rigorous criteria, we meticulously screened studies, eliminating duplicates or those unrelated to our focus. Subsequently, we critically evaluated the findings from the selected studies, descriptively summarizing them. Additionally, we engaged in an in-depth exploration of potential mechanistic pathways linking DD to cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Of the 388 citations obtained, 23 articles were included in the final review. All the studies reported a positive association between DD score and cognitive functioning and indicated that higher DD was accompanied by good memory (n = 3) and lower risk of cognitive decline (n = 19), dementia (n = 3), and Alzheimer's disease (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that sustaining a diverse diet among older people may help maintain cognitive functioning. Dietary diversity represents a promising clinical avenue for mitigating cognitive decline associated with diverse brain disorders, potentially preventing or attenuating deterioration.",BMC Neurol,2025
39703925,The neural basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as depression, anxiety, apathy and aggression affect up to 90% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These symptoms significantly increase caregiver stress and institutionalization rates, and more importantly they are correlated with faster cognitive decline. However, the neuronal basis of NPS in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we review current understanding of NPS and related pathology in studies of AD patients and AD mouse models. Clinical studies indicate that NPS prevalence and severity vary across different AD stages and types. Neuroimaging and postmortem studies have suggested that pathological changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala are linked to NPS, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Studies of AD mouse models have indicated that amyloid-beta and tau-related neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex are correlated with NPS-like behavioral deficits. A better understanding of the NPS phenotypes and related pathological changes will pave the way for developing a better management strategy for NPS in AD patients.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39702834,Therapeutic Potential of MCC950 in Restoring Autophagy and Cognitive Function in STZ-Induced Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, we explored the critical role of autophagy in AD pathology using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD model in Wistar rats. The experimental groups included sham, STZ-induced AD, and STZ + MCC950-treated animals. Our findings revealed that administering two doses of STZ (3 mg/kg) intracerebroventricular at the interval of 48 h (on days 0 and 2), triggered autophagy, as evidenced by elevated levels of autophagy markers such as LC3II, ULK1, Beclin1, Ambra1, Cathepsin B, and a reduction in p62 levels. Behavioral assessments, including the water maze and novel object recognition tests, confirmed cognitive deficits and memory impairment, while the open-field test indicated increased anxiety in STZ-induced AD rats. In particular, treating the STZ-induced AD group with MCC950 (50 mg/kg) decreased the overexpression of autophagy-related proteins, which was consistent with better behavioral outcomes and lower anxiety. Overall, this study highlights new insights into AD pathophysiology and suggests potential therapeutic avenues.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39944545,From pixels to prognosis: radiomics and AI in Alzheimer's disease management.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, poses a growing global health challenge due to an aging population. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for optimizing treatment and management, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fall short in addressing the complexity of AD pathology. Recent advancements in radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) offer novel solutions by integrating quantitative imaging features and machine learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic and prognostic precision. This review explores the application of radiomics and AI in AD, focusing on key imaging modalities such as PET and MRI, as well as multimodal approaches combining structural and functional data. We discuss the potential of these technologies to identify disease-specific biomarkers, predict disease progression, and guide personalized interventions. Additionally, the review addresses critical challenges, including data standardization, model interpretability, and the integration of AI into clinical workflows. By highlighting current achievements and identifying future directions, this article underscores the transformative potential of AI-driven radiomics in reshaping AD diagnostics and care.",Front Neurol,2025
40002497,Effect of N-Acetyl Cysteine as an Adjuvant Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Oxidative stress levels are exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This phenomenon feeds back into the overactivation of oxidase enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), with the stimulation of their receptors (RAGE). These factors stimulate Aβ peptide aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation through multiple pathways, which are addressed in this paper. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on oxidant/antioxidant balance as an adjuvant treatment in patients with AD. The results obtained showed that NAC supplementation produced improved cognitive performance, decreased levels of oxidative stress markers, lowered activities of oxidase enzymes, increased antioxidant responses, and attenuated inflammatory and apoptotic markers. Moreover, NAC reversed mitochondrial dysfunction, lowered AGEs-RAGE formation, attenuated Aβ peptide oligomerization, and reduced phosphorylation of tau, thereby halting the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and the progression of AD.",Brain Sci,2025
40132145,A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer Disease Clinical Trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Among the participants of Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment trials, 40% do not show cognitive decline over 80 weeks of follow-up. Identifying and excluding these individuals can increase power to detect treatment effects. We aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models to identify persons unlikely to show decline on placebo treatment over 80 weeks.
METHODS: We used the data from the placebo arm of EXPEDITION3 AD clinical trial and a subpopulation from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants in the EXPEDITION3 trial were patients with mild dementia and biomarker evidence of amyloid burden. For this study, participants were identified as those who demonstrated clinically meaningful cognitive decline (CMCD) or cognitively stable (CS) at final visit of the trial (week 80). Machine learning-based classifiers were trained to classify participants into CMCD vs CS groups using combinations of demographics, APOE genotype, neuropsychological tests, and biomarkers (volumetric MRI). The results were developed in 70% of the EXPEDITION3 placebo sample using 5-fold cross-validation. Trained models were then used to classify the participants in an internal validation sample and an external matched sample ADNI<sub>AD</sub>.
RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-four of the 1,072 participants in the placebo arm of the EXPEDITION3 trial had necessary follow-up data, who were on average aged 72.7 (±7.7) years and 59% female. 55.8% of those participants showed CMCD (∼2 years younger than those without) at the final visit. In the independent validation sample within the EXPEDITION3 data, all the models showed high sensitivity and modest specificity. Positive predictive values (PPVs) of models were at least 11% higher than base prevalence of CMCD observed at the end of the trial. The subset of matched ADNI participants (ADNI<sub>AD</sub>, N = 105) were aged 74.5 (±6.4) years and 46% female. The models that were validated in ADNI<sub>AD</sub> also showed high sensitivity, modest specificity, and PPVs of at least 15% higher than the base prevalence in ADNI<sub>AD</sub>.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that predictive models have the potential to improve the design of AD trials through selective inclusion and exclusion criteria based on expected cognitive decline. Such predictive models need further validation across data from different AD clinical trials.",Neurology,2025
40151398,Optimized 5-HT<sub>2b</sub> inhibitors for neuropsychiatric syndromes with cognitive dysfunction.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric syndromes such as anxiety and agitation are clinical presentations common to diverse neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury sequelae. They are a concern due to the impact on cognition, social interactions, and non-pharmacological treatments. Cognitive or behavioral disturbances occur at early disease stages and increase with disease progression. Coincident pathologies include the loss of serotonin (5-HT) neurons and appearance of neurofibrillary tangles in the raphe nucleus. Brain 5-HT<sub>2b</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R) levels are increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and post-stroke morbidity. HTR2B gene variants are implicated in psychiatric disorders. 5-HTRs are associated with atypical neurotropic drug mechanisms and behavioral dysfunction in drug abuse. The accumulating body of evidence suggests that selective 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R inhibition might mitigate neuropsychiatric syndromes and the associated cognitive dysfunction. Atypical neurotropic drugs interact with a variety of monoamine receptors and outcomes are viewed as a combination of 5-HT and dopamine D2 receptor mediated actions. Clearly, there is a need for insight into precision 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R inhibition as a potential pharmacological mechanism for treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes and cognitive dysfunction associated with dementia.
METHODS: Strategic optimization of an atypical neurotropic drug was used to develop MW073, a highly selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity and β-arrestin-1 recruitment that is devoid of dopamine receptor recognition and risk of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R agonist activity.
RESULTS: MW073 ameliorates amyloid and tau induction of behavioral dysfunction in preventive or disease stage intervention paradigms. Using MW073 as a standard of comparison, risperidone was shown to be a dose-dependent inhibitor 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity and β-arrestin-1 recruitment.
DISCUSSION: Selective inhibition of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity is a viable mechanism for the treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes with synaptic dysfunction as a root cause and is a previously unrealized pharmacodynamic mechanism potentially embedded in current neurotherapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: A new highly selective 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist, MW073, is described and used as a reference standard.MW073 attenuates synaptic and behavioral dysfunctions an animal models of neuropsychatric syndromes.Risperidone is a dose dependent inhibitor of 5-HT<sub>2b</sub>R activity and arrestin recruitment.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40057942,Temporal Changes in Alzheimer's Disease-Related Biomarkers in the CSF of Cognitively Normal Subjects at Different Ages: The Chongqing Ageing and Dementia Study.,"Revealing the temporal evolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers during aging is critical to understanding disease pathogenesis and developing early diagnoses and interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD). CSF was obtained from 549 cognitively normal subjects between 18 and 93 years of age. 12 AD-related biomarkers were evaluated, including amyloid β (Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau), neuronal injury/degeneration (T-tau, NFL, NSE, H-FABP, VILIP-1), neuroinflammation biomarkers (YKL-40, TREM2), and α-synuclein (α-synuclein). Associations between these biomarkers and age as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status were evaluated, and the associations among biomarkers were assessed. CSF Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau levels exhibited nonlinear associations with age, among which Aβ42 was significantly modulated by APOE ε4 status. Specifically, an accelerated decline in Aβ42 levels occurred at 45.69 years of age in the APOE ε4+ group, which was almost 23 years earlier than that in the APOE ε4- group (68.02 years). The age-related change pattern of CSF P-tau is similar to that of T-tau, with both increasing slightly with age but showing an accelerated change at ≈60 years of age in the APOE ε4+ group. All the other biomarkers except for α-synuclein were linearly associated with age, and APOE ε4 status had no effect on these associations. Most biomarkers were positively correlated with each other except for Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The evolution of AD-related biomarkers in CSF varies throughout the adult lifespan, with the APOE ε4 allele modifying the temporal changes in CSF Aβ42 levels, as well as potentially influencing P-tau and T-tau levels.",Aging Cell,2025
39886320,Impact of sleep disruptions on gray matter structural covariance networks across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"BACKGROUND: This study explores the impact of sleep disturbances on gray matter structural covariance networks (SCNs) across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum.
METHODS: Amyloid-negative participants served as controls, whereas amyloid positive (A+) individuals were categorized into six groups based on cognitive status and sleep quality. SCNs for the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) were derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images.
RESULTS: In the DMN, increased structural associations were observed in cognitive unimpaired (CU) A+ and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups regardless of sleep quality, whereas AD with poor sleep (PS) showed a decrease and AD with normal sleep (NS) an increase. For the ECN, AD-NS showed increased and AD-PS showed reduced associations. In the SN, reduced associations were observed in CU A+ NS and MCI-NS, whereas AD-NS displayed increased associations; only AD-PS had decreased associations.
CONCLUSION: Distinct SCN damage patterns between normal and poor sleepers provide insights into sleep disturbances in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We delineated distinct patterns of structural covariance networks (SCN) impairment across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, uncovering significant disparities between individuals with normal sleep architecture and those afflicted by sleep disturbances.These observations underscore the pivotal importance of addressing sleep disruptions in AD therapeutics, providing a refined understanding of their detrimental impact on brain networks implicated in the disease.Our investigation epitomizes methodological precision by constructing an AD continuum using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to minimize diagnostic heterogeneity, further enhanced by a substantial cohort size that bolsters the robustness and generalizability of our findings.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39868793,Linking higher amyloid beta 1-38 (Aβ(1-38)) levels to reduced Alzheimer's disease progression risk.,"INTRODUCTION: The beneficial effects of amyloid beta 1-38, or Aβ(1-38), on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in humans in vivo remain controversial. We investigated AD patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ(1-38) and AD progression.
METHODS: Cognitive function and diagnostic change were assessed annually for 3 years in 177 Aβ-positive participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) longitudinal cognitive impairment and dementia study (DELCODE) cohort using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. Mixed linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted. CSF was collected at baseline.
RESULTS: Higher Aβ(1-38) levels were associated with slower PACC (p = 0.001) and slower CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (p = 0.002) but not MMSE decline. Including Aβ(1-40) beyond Aβ(1-38) in the model confirmed an association of Aβ(1-38) with slower PACC decline (p = 0.005), but not with CDR-SB or MMSE decline. In addition, higher Aβ(1-38) baseline levels were associated with a reduced dementia conversion risk.
DISCUSSION: Further research is needed to understand the role of Aβ(1-38) in AD and its potential for future therapeutic strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study not only replicates but also extends the existing findings on the role of Aβ(1-38) (amyloid beta 1-38) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans in vivo. Higher baseline Aβ(1-38) levels were associated with a decreased risk of conversion to AD dementia in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Different linear-mixed regression models suggest an association between higher Aβ(1-38) baseline levels and slower Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) decline. Including Aβ(1-40) beyond Aβ(1-38) in the model confirmed a link between Aβ(1-38) and PACC decline, but showed no association of Aβ(1-38) on CDR-SB and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) decline. The impact of short Aβ isoforms in AD progression might have been under-investigated These findings underscore the urgent need for additional research on the role of these shorter Aβ peptides in AD, as they may hold key insights for future therapeutic strategies.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39780249,"evoke and evoke+: design of two large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies evaluating efficacy, safety, and tolerability of semaglutide in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying therapies targeting the diverse pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including neuroinflammation, represent potentially important and novel approaches. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity and has an established safety profile. Semaglutide may have a disease-modifying, neuroprotective effect in AD through multimodal mechanisms including neuroinflammatory, vascular, and other AD-related processes. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in early-stage symptomatic AD.
METHODS: evoke and evoke+ are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic AD. Eligible participants were men or women aged 55-85 years with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD with confirmed amyloid abnormalities (assessed by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] analysis). After a maximum 12-week screening phase, an anticipated 1840 patients in each trial are randomized (1:1) to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension). Randomized participants follow an 8-week dose escalation regimen (3 mg [weeks 0-4], 7 mg [weeks 4-8], and 14 mg [weeks 8-156]). The primary endpoint is the semaglutide-placebo difference on change from baseline to week 104 in the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes score. Analyses of plasma biomarkers, collected from all participants, and a CSF sub-study (planned n = 210) will explore semaglutide effects on AD biomarkers and neuroinflammation.
RESULTS: Enrollment was undertaken between May 18, 2021, and September 8, 2023. Completion of the trials' main phase is expected in September 2025, and the 52-week extension (in which participants and investigators remain blinded to treatment assignment) will continue to October 2026.
CONCLUSION: evoke and evoke+ are the first large-scale trials to investigate the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in participants with early-stage symptomatic AD, including exploration of effects on AD biomarkers and neuroinflammation. The trials will provide data on the potential disease-modifying effects of semaglutide and will be important in evaluating its utility in the treatment of early-stage symptomatic AD.

39705191,WDR49-Positive Astrocytes Mark Severity of Neurodegeneration in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease.,"A subpopulation of astrocytes expressing WD Repeat Domain 49 (WDR49) was recently identified in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with GRN pathogenic variants. This is the first study to investigate their expression and relation to pathology in other FTLD subtypes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a postmortem cohort of TDP-43 proteinopathies (12 GRN, 11 C9orf72, 9 sporadic TDP-43), tauopathies (13 MAPT, 8 sporadic tau), 10 AD, and four controls, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed for WDR49 and pathological inclusions on frontal, temporal, and occipital cortical sections. WDR49-positive cell counts (adjusted per mm<sup>2</sup>) were examined and related to digitally quantified percentage areas of TDP-43/tau pathology and semiquantitative scores of neurodegeneration. Quantitative colocalization analysis of WDR49 and pathological inclusions was done. WDR49-positive astrocytes were present across FTLD subtypes and AD in the brain parenchyma and (peri-)vascular space, with distinct morphological patterns, and were particularly enriched in gray matter. In controls, sporadic WDR49-positive cells were found enveloping vessels. WDR49-positive astrocytes were most abundant in the frontal cortex (FC) of GRN cases and temporal cortex in GRN, AD, and sporadic primary tauopathy. In the occipital cortex, only a few cells were found across groups. WDR49-positive astrocyte counts positively correlated with the severity of neurodegeneration and TDP-43 pathology but not tauopathy. Furthermore, in frontotemporal cortices, WDR49 partly colocalized with TDP-43 (14%-21%) and tau (31%-45%). In conclusion, WDR49 is a marker for a subset of astrocytes with different morphologies across FTLD and AD, reflecting the severity of neurodegeneration. These astrocytes may become activated in neurodegeneration in response to pathological damage and migrate from the vessel wall to the parenchyma.",Glia,2025
40046342,Biological signatures in the Alzheimer's continuum discriminate between diagnosis-related and -unrelated associations to ATN categories.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias have a multifactorial aetiology and heterogeneous biology. The current study aims to identify different biological signatures in a deeply phenotyped memory clinic patient population. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed 49 pre-specified proteins using a multiplex antibody-based suspension bead array in 278 CSF samples from the real-world research database and biobank at the Karolinska University Hospital Memory Clinic, Solna, Sweden. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of subjective cognitive decline (N = 151), mild cognitive impairment (N = 61), Alzheimer's disease (N = 47), or other diagnoses (N = 19; vascular dementias, alcohol-related dementia, unspecified dementias, or other amnesias) were included. Principal component analyses were performed, and resulting principal components (PCs) were tested for associations with clinical variables and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (CSF biomarkers beta-amyloid 42, beta-amyloid 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181, phosphorylated tau 181/beta-amyloid 42). PC 1 (explaining 52% of the variance between patients) was associated with the clinical Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers beta-amyloid 42, phosphorylated tau 181, and total tau but not with Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration imaging markers, cognitive performance, or clinical diagnosis. PC 2 (explaining 9% of the variance) displayed an inflammatory profile with high contributions of chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and significant correlation to CSF free light chain kappa. In contrast to PC 1, PC 3 (explaining 5% of the variance) showed associations with all the clinical Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers, the imaging markers, cognitive impairment and clinical diagnosis. Serpin family A member 3 (SERPINA3), chitinase 1 (CHIT1), and neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) contributed most to PC 3. PC 4 (explaining 4% of the variance) exhibited an inflammatory profile distinct from PC 2, with the largest contributions from TREM2, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) and complement C9. The component was associated with peripheral inflammation. We found that CSF protein profiles in a memory clinic cohort reflect molecular differences across diagnostic groups. Our results emphasize that real-world memory clinic patients can have different ongoing biological processes despite receiving the same diagnosis. In the future, this information could be utilized to identify patient endotypes and uncover precision biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.",Brain Commun,2025
40149595,"Genomic Characterisation of the Relationship and Causal Links Between Vascular Calcification, Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Traits.","Background/Objectives: Observational studies suggest a link between vascular calcification and dementia or cognitive decline, but the evidence is conflicting, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigate the shared genetic and causal relationships of vascular calcification-coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC)-with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and five cognitive traits. Methods: We analyse large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, using well-regarded methods, including linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), Mendelian randomisation (MR), pairwise GWAS (GWAS-PW), and gene-based association analysis. Results: Our findings reveal a nominally significant positive genome-wide genetic correlation between CAC and AD, which becomes non-significant after excluding the APOE region. CAC and AAC demonstrate significant negative correlations with cognitive performance and educational attainment. MR found no causal association between CAC or AAC and AD or cognitive traits, except for a bidirectional borderline-significant association between AAC and fluid intelligence scores. Pairwise-GWAS analysis identifies no shared causal SNPs (posterior probability of association [PPA]3 &lt; 0.5). However, we find pleiotropic loci (PPA4 &gt; 0.9), particularly on chromosome 19, with gene association analyses revealing significant genes in shared regions, including APOE, TOMM40, NECTIN2, and APOC1. Moreover, we identify suggestively significant loci (PPA4 &gt; 0.5) on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9 and 19, implicating pleiotropic genes, including NAV1, IPO9, PHACTR1, UFL1, FHL5, and FOCAD. Conclusions: Current findings reveal limited genetic correlation and no significant causal associations of CAC and AAC with AD or cognitive traits. However, significant pleiotropic loci, particularly at the APOE region, highlight the complex interplay between vascular calcification and neurodegenerative processes. Given APOE's roles in lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and vascular integrity, its involvement may link vascular and neurodegenerative disorders, pointing to potential targets for further investigation.",Biomedicines,2025
39767690,The Promising Potency of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in the Prevention of and as Treatment for Cognitive Impairment Among Type 2 Diabetes Patients.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), accounting for the majority of diabetes mellitus prevalence, is associated with an increased risk of cognition decline and deterioration of cognition function in diabetic patients. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the renal proximal tubule, plays a role in urine glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shown potential benefits beyond cardiac and renal improvement in preventing and treating cognitive impairment (CI), including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in T2DM patients. Studies suggest that SGLT2i may ameliorate diabetic CI through metabolism pathways, inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotrophic factors and AChE inhibition. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have reported significant and insignificant results. Given their vascular effects, SGLT2i may offer unique protection against vascular CI. This review compiles mechanisms and clinical evidence, emphasizing the need for future analysis, evaluation, trials and meta-analyses to verify and recommend optimal SGLT2i selection and dosage for specific patients.",Biomedicines,2024
39814270,Fine social discrimination of siblings in mice: Implications for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.,"The ability to distinguish between individuals is crucial for social species and supports behaviors such as reproduction, hierarchy formation, and cooperation. In rodents, social discrimination relies on memory and the recognition of individual-specific cues, known as ""individual signatures"". While olfactory signals are central, other sensory cues - such as auditory, visual, and tactile inputs - also play a role. However, little research has explored the fine discrimination of individuals with overlapping cues, such as siblings or cohabitating mice. This study investigates whether mice can discriminate between two closely related individuals: siblings from the same litter and cage. We tested the hypothesis that it would be more challenging for mice to distinguish between siblings than between unrelated mice due to shared cues. Moreover, social cognitive impairments are common in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), where difficulties in recognizing faces and voices progressively disrupt social interactions in patients. Using a mouse model of AD (Tg2576), known for the progressive onset of cognitive deficits, we assessed whether the ability to discriminate between siblings is preserved in ""pre-symptomatic"" animals. Thus, we first demonstrated that male and female C57BL6/J mice can discriminate siblings, regardless of sex. Next, we revealed that ""pre-symptomatic"" 3-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibit impairments in fine social memory, while their general social memory remains unaffected. Thus, we demonstrate that the inability to perform fine social discrimination is an early cognitive impairment that arises before other well-documented memory abnormalities in this AD mouse model.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39814544,Validation of Spatial Orientation Screening questionnaire for use in memory clinic patients.,"BACKGROUND: Spatial orientation is required for independent mobility in society. Deficits in spatial orientation can be an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and there is a need for brief assessment tools to identify impairments.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the construct and known-group validity of our newly developed Spatial Orientation Screening (SOS) questionnaire.
METHODS: We included 132 patients with subjective cognitive decline (n = 16), mild cognitive impairment (n = 32), or all-cause dementia (n = 84) from a memory clinic and a reference group of cognitively unimpaired older adults (n = 108). The patients and their next-of-kin answered the self- and proxy-rated versions of the 4-item SOS (0-8 points) and the 10-item Questionnaire of Everyday Navigational Ability (QuENA, 0-30 points). The patients also performed the Floor Maze Test (FMT) for performance-based spatial abilities.
RESULTS: Mean ages (SD) of the patient and reference groups were 68.6 (±7.6) years and 73.7 (±6.7) years, respectively. Construct validity between self-rated versions of the SOS and QuENA was satisfactory with r<sub>s </sub>= 0.66, between the proxy-rated versions r<sub>s </sub>= 0.61, and between the proxy-reported SOS and FMT r<sub>s </sub>= 0.49 (all p &lt; 0.001). Known-group validity was also acceptable, with significantly higher median (IQR) SOS self-reported scores in patients 1.0 (2.0) compared to the reference group 0.2 (0.5) points, (p &lt; 0.001). Informants reported more severe impairments compared to the patients' self-reports on both SOS and QuENA (both p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The SOS had satisfactory validity for use as a screening instrument for assessment of spatial orientation in memory clinic patients.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40071123,The role of protein phosphorylation modifications mediated by iron metabolism regulatory networks in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized mainly by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and abnormal phosphorylation of tau. In recent years, an imbalance in iron homeostasis has been recognized to play a key role in the pathological process of AD. Abnormal iron accumulation can activate various kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to abnormal phosphorylation of tau and amyloid precursor protein, and accelerating the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, iron-mediated oxidative stress not only triggers neuronal damage, but also exacerbates neuronal dysfunction by altering the phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Iron accumulation also affects the phosphorylation status of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, interfering with the dopamine signaling pathway. On the other hand, iron affects iron transport and metabolism in the brain by regulating the phosphorylation of transferrin, further disrupting iron homeostasis. Therapeutic strategies targeting iron metabolism show promise by reducing iron accumulation, inhibiting oxidative stress, and reducing abnormal phosphorylation of key proteins. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of phosphorylation modifications mediated by iron homeostasis imbalance in AD, and discusses the potential of interventions that regulate iron metabolism and related signaling pathways, providing a new theoretical basis for the treatment of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40025904,Enhancing Lateral Resolution Using Two-Colour Direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy to Unravel Synaptic Tau Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease.,"AIMS: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological accumulation of tau in synapses contributes to synapse dysfunction and loss. However, the small and complex structure of synapses limits the investigation when using conventional techniques. In this work, we describe the combination of array tomography (AT) with two-colour direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to enhance lateral resolution for resolving synaptic terminals in human postmortem brain.
METHODS: We applied this combination to study synapses in brain samples (from biopsy and postmortem) from healthy subjects and pathological synaptic tau (aggregates and oligomers) in samples from AD patients.
RESULTS: AT combined with dSTORM allowed the characterisation of the orientation and shape of the synaptic terminals and the synaptic cleft. In addition, this combination confirmed the presence of oligomeric tau in synaptic terminals in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that the combination of AT and two-colour dSTORM provides optimal resolution to detect pathological synaptic tau and its spatial relationship with presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,2025
39807706,Multimodal imaging of murine cerebrovascular dynamics induced by transcranial pulse stimulation.,"INTRODUCTION: Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is increasingly being investigated as a promising potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of TPS short pulses have been supported by neuropsychological scores in treated AD patients, its fundamental mechanisms are uncharted.
METHODS: Herein, we used a multi-modal preclinical imaging platform combining real-time volumetric optoacoustic tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and ex vivo immunofluorescence to comprehensively analyze structural and hemodynamic effects induced by TPS. Cohorts of healthy and AD transgenic mice were imaged during and after TPS exposure at various per-pulse energy levels.
RESULTS: TPS enhanced the microvascular network, whereas the blood-brain barrier remained intact following the procedure. Notably, higher pulse energies were necessary to induce hemodynamic changes in AD mice, arguably due to their impacted vessels.
DISCUSSION: These findings shed light on cerebrovascular dynamics induced by TPS treatment, and hence are expected to assist improving safety and therapeutic outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: ·Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) facilitates transcranial wave propagation using short pulses to avoid tissue heating. ·Preclinical multi-modal imaging combines real-time volumetric optoacoustic (OA) tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI), and ex vivo immunofluorescence to comprehensively analyze structural and hemodynamic effects induced by TPS. ·Blood volume enhancement in microvascular networks was reproducibly observed with real-time OA imaging during TPS stimulation. ·CE-MRI and gross pathology further confirmed that the brain architecture was maintained intact without blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening after TPS exposure, thus validating the safety of the procedure. ·Higher pulse energies were necessary to induce hemodynamic changes in AD compared to wild-type animals, arguably due to their pathological vessels.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39789805,The novel T107I Inherited prion disease can present as a clinical and biomarker mimic of familial Alzheimer's disease.,"Inherited prion diseases (IPD) secondary to mutations of the prion protein gene, PRNP, exhibit diverse clinical phenotypes, capable of mimicking numerous primary neurodegenerative conditions. We describe the clinical phenotype and neuropathological findings in a family from County Limerick in Ireland presenting with Alzheimer's disease-like cognitive decline and motor symptoms caused by a novel missense mutation of PRNP. This mutation occurs in the PRNP central lysine cluster (CLC; codon 101-110), resulting in substitution of threonine with isoleucine at codon 107 (T107I). This case series highlights that IPD can be hard to distinguish from overlapping clinical syndromes seen in other neurodegenerative diseases. We also discuss similarities and differences of the novel mutation T107I to other pathogenic mutations of the CLC of PRNP.",J Neurogenet,2025

39715167,Multimodal feature fusion-based graph convolutional networks for Alzheimer's disease stage classification using F-18 florbetaben brain PET images and clinical indicators.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent degenerative brain disease associated with dementia, requires early diagnosis to alleviate worsening of symptoms through appropriate management and treatment. Recent studies on AD stage classification are increasingly using multimodal data. However, few studies have applied graph neural networks to multimodal data comprising F-18 florbetaben (FBB) amyloid brain positron emission tomography (PET) images and clinical indicators. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of graph convolutional network (GCN) for AD stage classification using multimodal data, specifically FBB PET images and clinical indicators, collected from Dong-A University Hospital (DAUH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The effectiveness of GCN was demonstrated through comparisons with the support vector machine, random forest, and multilayer perceptron across four classification tasks (normal control (NC) vs. AD, NC vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI vs. AD). As input, all models received the same combined feature vectors, created by concatenating the PET imaging feature vectors extracted by the 3D dense convolutional network and non-imaging feature vectors consisting of clinical indicators using multimodal feature fusion method. An adjacency matrix for the population graph was constructed using cosine similarity or the Euclidean distance between subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and/or non-imaging feature vectors. The usage ratio of these different modal data and edge assignment threshold were tuned by setting them as hyperparameters. In this study, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com were the GCN models that received the adjacency matrix constructed using cosine similarity (CS) and the Euclidean distance (ED) between the subjects' PET imaging feature vectors and non-imaging feature vectors, respectively. In modified nested cross validation, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 98.40%, 94.58%, 94.01%, 82.63% and 99.68%, 93.82%, 93.88%, 90.43% for the four aforementioned classification tasks using DAUH dataset, outperforming the other models. Furthermore, GCN-CS-com and GCN-ED-com respectively achieved average test accuracies of 76.16% and 90.11% for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification using ADNI dataset, outperforming the other models. These results demonstrate that GCN could be an effective model for AD stage classification using multimodal data.",PLoS One,2024

39886338,Sex and APOE genotype modulate neuropsychological profile and depression in temporal lobe epilepsy.,"INTRODUCTION: Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of focal epilepsy, often associated with cognitive impairments, particularly in memory functions, and depression. Sex and APOE ε4 genotype play a crucial role in modulating cognitive outcomes and depression in various neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. However, the combined effects of APOE genotype and sex on cognitive performance and depression in temporal lobe epilepsy have not been previously investigated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (i) identify impaired cognitive performance and clinically relevant depression; (ii) explore the interaction between sex and APOE ε4 genotype on cognitive performance and depression in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.
METHODS: We used a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to assess domains such as learning and memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuo-spatial constructional skills and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. We also performed APOE genotyping to assess its role in the study. The final sample was composed by fifty-four patients (53.7% female). Cognitive performance and depression were analyzed using normative cut-off scores. To examine the main effects and interactions of sex and APOE ε4 carrier status on neuropsychological test scores and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, we also conducted a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
RESULTS: Female APOE ε4 carriers compared to normative cut-offs, exhibited poor performance on multiple test scores, including the MMSE, The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (immediate and delayed recall), The Corsi Block-Tapping Task, The Verbal Fluency Test, The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and The Pentagon-copying Test. Males showed impairment only in visuo-spatial short-term memory. ANOVA analysis revealed significant main effects of APOE ε4 status and sex on the MMSE, The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, The Verbal Fluency, The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and The Pentagon-copying Test scores. Specifically, female APOE ε4 carriers performed consistently worse than other groups on many tasks. For depression, only an effect of sex emerged. Females scored higher besides APOE genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of considering both sex and APOE genotype when assessing cognitive performance in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The significant cognitive deficits we observed among females carrying the APOE ε4 allele highlight previously unexplored genetic and sex-related influences on cognition. This has potential implications for personalized therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for targeted assessment and intervention.",Front Neurosci,2024
39702710,Mechanistic Modeling the Role of MicroRNAs and Transcription Factors in Disease Progression.,"In this chapter, we illustrate the utilization of network analysis and mechanistic modeling, two potent branches of systems biology, to simplify the representation of intricate biological processes such as cell signaling, gene regulation, and metabolic pathways. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of a well-established method to generate a microRNA-transcription factor-gene regulatory feed-forward loop network extracted from the GEO dataset GSE163877. Furthermore, we outline a method for constructing a deterministic model using the LSODA method based on the sub-network. This model furnishes insights into the roles of crucial differentially expressed microRNAs and transcription factors in gene expression associated with Alzheimer's disease progression. Our analysis of the model reveals elevated kinetics of synthesis for EGR1, miR-6891, miR-4786, and LTBP1. The model suggests the linear upregulation of miR-8080, miR-3921, HSPB6, and downregulation MX2 gene. The rest of the miRNA, TFs, and genes shows a momentary variation in expression and if the system is undisturbed, they attain equilibrium. Thus, we elucidate how mechanistic modeling, along with perturbation studies and network analysis of expression data, can yield diverse insights into the trajectory of disease progression.",Methods Mol Biol,2025
39822297,Older US adults' experiences with and views about cognitive screening and blood biomarker testing for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Dementia is underdiagnosed in the United States. Understanding of older adults' experiences with screening is needed to optimize diagnosis.
METHODS: US adults ages 65 to 80 (N = 1298) were surveyed on experiences with cognitive screening and blood biomarker (BBM) testing. Regression models estimated associations between characteristics and screening use.
RESULTS: Most older adults were aware of screening (71%); 41% reported ever being screened. Older age, higher education, retirement, poorer health, and family history of dementia were associated with higher odds of screening; Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian race/ethnicity were associated with lower odds (p &lt; .05). Most older adults were unaware of BBM (81%); few wanted testing immediately (9%). Although older adults held positive views about screening and BBM, half reported concerns about distress or stigma if tests indicated risk.
DISCUSSION: Cognitive screening rates remain low. Older adults view screening and BBM as useful to inform health decisions but have concerns about potential harms.
HIGHLIGHTS: Only one in five older US adults report having cognitive screening in the past year.Sociodemographic and health factors may influence whether older adults receive cognitive screening.Most older adults have positive views about cognitive screening and BBM testing.Many older adults would be concerned about distress or stigma if test result indicated dementia risk.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39737436,Olfactory deficits in aging and Alzheimer's-spotlight on inhibitory interneurons.,"Cognitive function in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates to olfactory performance. Aging and disease progression both show marked olfactory deficits in humans and rodents. As a clear understanding of what causes olfactory deficits is still missing, research on this topic is paramount to diagnostics and early intervention therapy. A recent development of this research is focusing on GABAergic interneurons. Both aging and AD show a change in excitation/inhibition balance, indicating reduced inhibitory network functions. In the olfactory system, inhibition has an especially prominent role in processing information, as the olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay station of olfactory information in the brain, contains an unusually high number of inhibitory interneurons. This review summarizes the current knowledge on inhibitory interneurons at the level of the OB and the primary olfactory cortices to gain an overview of how these neurons might influence olfactory behavior. We also compare changes in interneuron composition in different olfactory brain areas between healthy aging and AD as the most common neurodegenerative disease. We find that pathophysiological changes in olfactory areas mirror findings from hippocampal and cortical regions that describe a marked cell loss for GABAergic interneurons in AD but not aging. Rather than differences in brain areas, differences in vulnerability were shown for different interneuron populations through all olfactory regions, with somatostatin-positive cells most strongly affected.",Front Neurosci,2024
39766423,A Review of the Consequences of Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Aging.,"Age-associated alterations in the brain lead to cognitive deterioration and neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizes the burgeoning significance of the gut microbiota (GMB) in neuroinflammation and its impact on the gut-brain axis (GBA), a communication conduit between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). Changes in the gut microbiome, including diminished microbial diversity and the prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria, are associated with AD pathogenesis. Promising therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and prebiotics, may restore gut health and enhance cognitive performance. Clinical data remain insufficient, necessitating further research to elucidate causes, enhance therapy, and consider individual variances. This integrative approach may yield innovative therapies aimed at the GMB to improve cognitive function and brain health in older people.",Brain Sci,2024
39749011,Diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia: blood plasma and optical coherence tomography.,"Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is crucial for enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers (neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau181) and retinal biomarkers (retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer), individually and in combination, in differentiating moderate cognitive impairment and dementia from mild cognitive impairment and no cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 509 participants, aged 50 and older, recruited from a memory clinic. The participants were categorized as normal (n = 100), mild cognitive impairment (n = 144), moderate cognitive impairment (n = 90) or dementia (n = 175) based on detailed clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing and MRI scans. The thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (P &lt; 0.001) and retinal nerve fibre layer (P = 0.030) decreased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia. The thickest layers were observed in individuals with no cognitive impairment (mean ± standard deviation: ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 76 ± 11 µm, retinal nerve fibre layer: 92 ± 10 µm), while the thinnest layers were found in individuals with dementia (ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer: 72 ± 14 µm, retinal nerve fibre layer: 89 ± 12 µm). Plasma biomarker levels increased progressively from normal cognition to cognitive impairment and dementia (P &lt; 0.001). Levels were lowest in individuals with no cognitive impairment [median (interquartile range): neurofilament light chain: 15 (9) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 1.85 (1.00) pg/mL] and highest in those with dementia [neurofilament light chain: 34 (27) pg/mL, phosphorylated tau181: 3.24 (2.81) pg/mL]. After adjusting for retinal scan signal strength, neurofilament light chain showed a stronger negative association with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [standardized beta estimate (β) = -0.184] and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (β = -0.139) compared to phosphorylated tau181, which exhibited weaker associations with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (β = -0.091) and retinal nerve fibre layer (β = -0.059). While retinal parameters provided modest discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.60), plasma biomarkers demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.76). Notably, neurofilament light chain had a stronger association with retinal thinning than phosphorylated tau181 and offered superior diagnostic value for identifying moderate cognitive decline. These findings underscore the potential of plasma biomarkers, particularly neurofilament light chain, for the early detection of dementia.",Brain Commun,2025
39711292,Performance of study partner reports in a non-demented at-risk sample.,"INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale is a gold standard for staging impairment in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADRD). The Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) offers similar results in 3 to 5 minutes without a trained clinician. This study aimed to (1) investigate concordance between comparably derived QDRS and CDR global scores, (2) examine item-level QDRS/CDR agreement, and (3) compare sample characteristics and cognitive performance across QDRS/CDR global concordant/discordant groups.
METHODS: The study included 351 QDRS/CDR pairs from 297 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Analyses included descriptive indices of QDRS/CDR agreement, lasso logistic regression, tetrachoric correlations, and linear mixed models.
RESULTS: The QDRS global/CDR global concordance rate is 70.66%. Memory item discrepancies were primarily responsible for QDRS/CDR global rating discordance. Average cognitive scores were highest in concordant-normal QDRS/CDR and lowest in concordant-abnormal QDRS/CDR.
DISCUSSION: The QDRS effectively screened for impairment in this sample. Future analyses will investigate QDRS relations to ADRD biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) effectively screened for impairment in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADRD) in a non-demented sample. Concordance rate between QDRS<sub>CDR</sub> global and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale global scores is 70.66%. Memory item discrepancies primarily cause QDRS/CDR global score discordance.

39888320,Hippocampal neuronal loss and cognitive decline in LATE-NC and ADNC among community-dwelling older persons.,"INTRODUCTION: This study investigates the inter-related roles of hippocampal neuronal loss (HNL), limbic-predominant age-related TAR-DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC), and Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) on cognitive decline.
METHODS: Participants underwent annual cognitive testing and autopsy. HNL, ADNC, LATE-NC, and other age-related pathologies were evaluated. Regression and mixed-effects models examined the association of HNL with ADNC and LATE-NC, and separately with cognitive decline. Path analyses examined the extent to which associations of LATE-NC and ADNC with cognitive decline were attributable to HNL.
RESULTS: LATE-NC was associated with more severe HNL, but ADNC was associated only after excluding subjects with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). HNL was associated with faster decline in global cognition and episodic, semantic, and working memory. In path analyses, about 61% of the association of LATE-NC with cognitive decline was attributable to HNL, whereas for ADNC it was mostly independent of HNL.
DISCUSSION: HNL has an independent contribution to cognitive decline and acts as a major step in LATE-NC-related cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hippocampal neuronal loss (HNL) is associated with cognitive decline. HNL is a prominent feature of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) and less so with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). HNL acts as a major pathway in cognitive decline for LATE-NC. Differential mechanisms in hippocampal degeneration are associated with LATE-NC versus ADNC.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40111935,Neuroprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in cellular models of Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic brain degenerative disease that leads to dementia.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study is to investigate the neuroprotective impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) (empagliflozin and dapagliflozin) on tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.MethodsWe used MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, annexin-V-FITC kit, and DCFH-DA (dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate) to respectively evaluate the effect of the SGLT2i (empagliflozin and dapagliflozin) on amyloid-β (Aβ)<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neuronal death, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. The expression of NLRP3-inflammasome, phospho-Tau181, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CdK5), and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), was quantified by flow cytometry. Drug distribution in the mice's brains was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).ResultsAβ<sub>1-42</sub> significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, which was reversed by using gliflozins. SGLT2i significantly reduced Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced reactive oxygen species generation, downregulated NLRP3-inflammasome, and diminished tau pathology. Mechanistically, the last effect involved the modulation of GSK-3β and CdK5 protein expression. However, the tested treatments did not modify the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-stimulating effect of HDAC6. Gliflozins are substrates of drug transporters ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 and/or ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCB1 and ABCG2), and Elacridar significantly enhances their brain distribution.ConclusionsSGLT2i empagliflozin and dapagliflozin exhibited neuroprotective actions against human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neurotoxicity.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39804285,Reliability of direct-to-home teleneuropsychological assessment: a within-subject design study.,"Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to continue diagnosis and treatment processes, in addition to scientific research, led to a rapid shift towards direct-to-home tele-neuropsychology administrations, the reliability and validity of which had not been clearly established then. This study, therefore, aimed to examine the reliability of direct-to-home tele-neuropsychological assessment (TNP). Method: The sample included 105 cognitively healthy individuals aged between 50-83 years, and 47 patients diagnosed with neurocognitive disorders (mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer's type dementia). All participants underwent both face-to-face and teleneuropsychological assessments in a counterbalanced order. Results: The results revealed that performances across measures of attention, working memory, verbal fluency, verbal and visual memory, and visual perception were comparable across assessment modalities. Intraclass correlation coefficients of the tests ranged from .54 to .92. Conclusions: The findings of the study provide support for direct-to-home teleneuropsychological assessment among patients with neurocognitive disorders. Neuropsychological tests relying on verbal administration and independent of motor performance may represent a reliable alternative for this patient group when administered in settings where external distractions or technological limitations are controlled. For cognitively healthy individuals, on the other hand, the reliability of the TNP application is more questionable for memory and some executive function tests and therefore needs further exploration.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
40159237,Differential senolytic inhibition of normal versus Aβ-associated cholinesterases: implications in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging and the age-related condition, Alzheimer's disease (AD). How senescence contributes to cholinergic and neuropathologic changes in AD remains uncertain. Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between senescence and cholinesterases (ChEs). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are important in neurotransmission, cell cycle regulation, and AD amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Senolytic agents have shown therapeutic promise in AD models. Therefore, we evaluated in vitro and in silico activity of senolytics, dasatinib (1), nintedanib (2), fisetin (3), quercetin (4), GW2580 (5), and nootropic, meclofenoxate hydrochloride (6), toward AChE and BChE. As ChEs associated with AD pathology have altered biochemical properties, we also evaluated agents 1-6 in AD brain tissues. Enzyme kinetics showed agents 1, 3, 4, and 6 inhibited both ChEs, while 2 and 5 inhibited only AChE. Histochemistry showed inhibition of Aβ plaque-associated ChEs (1 and 2: both ChEs; 5: BChE; 6: AChE), but not normal neural-associated ChEs. Modeling studies showed 1-6 interacted with the same five binding locations of both ChEs, some of which may be allosteric sites. These agents may exert their beneficial effects, in part, by inhibiting ChEs associated with AD pathology and provide new avenues for development of next-generation inhibitors targeting pathology-associated ChEs.",Aging (Albany NY),2025

39789340,Human iPSC-derived microglial cells protect neurons from neurodegeneration in long-term cultured adhesion brain organoids.,"Brain organoid models have greatly facilitated our understanding of human brain development and disease. However, key brain cell types, such as microglia, are lacking in most brain organoid models. Because microglia have been shown to play important roles in brain development and pathologies, attempts have been made to add microglia to brain organoids through co-culture. However, only short-term microglia-organoid co-cultures can be established, and it remains challenging to have long-lasting survival of microglia in organoids to mimic long-term residency of microglia in the brain. In this study, we developed an adhesion brain organoid (ABO) platform that allows prolonged culture of brain organoids (greater than a year). Moreover, the long-term (LT)-ABO system contains abundant astrocytes and can support prolonged survival and ramification of microglia. Furthermore, we showed that microglia in the LT-ABO could protect neurons from neurodegeneration by increasing synaptic density and reducing p-Tau level and cell death in the LT-ABO. Therefore, the microglia-containing LT-ABO platform generated in this study provides a promising human cellular model for studying neuron-glia and glia-glia interactions in brain development and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",Commun Biol,2025
39696638,Dementia with lewy bodies patients with high tau levels display unique proteome profiles.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have long observed that neurodegenerative disorders display a range of symptoms and pathological features and, in some cases, overlap, suggesting that these diseases exist on a spectrum. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), a synucleinopathy, is a prominent example, where symptomatic similarities with tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, are observed. Although tau pathology has been observed in DLB, the interplay between tau and α-synuclein is poorly understood at a molecular level.
METHODS: Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis was used to measure protein abundance in the insoluble fraction from cortical brain tissue from pathologically diagnosed DLB subjects (n = 30) and age-matched controls (n = 29). Using tau abundance, we stratified the DLB subjects into two subgroups termed DLBTau<sup>+</sup> (higher abundance) and DLBTau<sup>-</sup> (lower abundance). We conducted proteomic analysis to characterize and compare the cortical proteome of DLB subjects exhibiting elevated tau, as well as the molecular modifications of tau and α-synuclein to explore the dynamic between tau and α-synuclein pathology in these patients.
RESULTS: Proteomic analyses revealed distinct global protein dysregulations in DLBTau<sup>+</sup> and DLBTau<sup>-</sup> subjects when compared to controls. Notably, DLBTau<sup>+</sup> patients exhibited increased levels of tau, along with ubiquitin, and APOE, indicative of cortical proteome alterations associated with elevated tau. Comparing DLBTau<sup>+</sup> and DLBTau<sup>-</sup> groups, we observed significant upregulation of cytokine signaling and metabolic pathways in DLBTau<sup>-</sup> patients, while DLBTau<sup>+</sup> subjects showed increases in protein ubiquitination processes and regulation of vesicle-mediated transport. Additionally, we examined the post-translational modification patterns of tau and α-synuclein. Our analysis revealed distinct phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites on α-synuclein between groups. Moreover, we observed increased modifications on tau specifically within the DLBTau<sup>+</sup> subgroup.
CONCLUSION: This molecular-level data supports the idea of neurodegenerative disease as a continuum of diseases with distinct PTM profiles DLBTau<sup>+</sup> and DLBTau<sup>-</sup> patients in comparison to AD. These findings further emphasize the importance of identifying specific and tailored therapeutic approaches targeting the involved proteopathies in the neurodegenerative disease spectrum.",Mol Neurodegener,2024
40146773,Presynaptic recycling pool density regulates spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis rate and is upregulated in the presence of β-amyloid.,"Synapses represent a fundamental unit of information transfer during cognition via presynaptic vesicle exocytosis. It has been established that evoked release is probabilistic, but the mechanisms behind spontaneous release are less clear. Understanding spontaneous release is vital, as it plays a key role in maintaining synaptic connections. We propose a model framework for spontaneous release where the reserve pool geometrically constrains recycling pool vesicles, creating an entropic force that drives spontaneous release rate. We experimentally support this framework using SEM, fluorescence microscopy, computational modeling, and pharmacological approaches. Our model correctly predicts the spontaneous release rate as a function of presynapse size. Finally, we use our approach to show how β-amyloid mutations linked to Alzheimer's disease lead to increased spontaneous release rates. These results indicate that synapses regulate the density of the recycling pool to control the spontaneous release rate and may serve as an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease.",Cell Rep,2025
39711133,"Lewy body co-pathology in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy contributes to differential neuropathological, cognitive, and brain atrophy patterns.","INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathology with Lewy bodies (LB) is frequent and influences clinical manifestations and outcomes. Its significance in primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is unknown. We investigated the influence of LB on cognition and brain atrophy in AD and PART.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in a large sample of autopsied participants with AD neuropathological change (ADNC) with and without LB and PART with and without LB, with corresponding ante mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset.
RESULTS: LB co-pathology worsened cognitive impairment in both PART and ADNC. On longitudinal follow-up, LB impacted cognitive decline in multiple domains. Additionally, LB influenced brain atrophy on MRI across groups and LB regional staging was different in PART and ADNC, accompanying tauopathy progression.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that LB co-pathology is associated with divergent patterns of cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and regional pathological distribution in PART and AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lewy body (LB) co-pathology is frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with important clinical implications. LB co-pathology is also present in primary age-related tauopathy (PART), but its significance is still understudied. In PART and AD, LB leads to higher cognitive impairment and brain regional atrophy. In PART and AD, LB tends to accompany neurofibrillary tangle progression, suggesting amyloid pathology might be a trigger for regional pathology progression.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39713867,Neuropathological correlates of vulnerability and resilience in the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether the cerebellum develops neuropathology that correlates with well-accepted Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological markers and cognitive status.
METHODS: We studied cerebellar cytoarchitecture in a cohort (N = 30) of brain donors. In a larger cohort (N = 605), we queried whether the weight of the contents of the posterior fossa (PF), which contains primarily cerebellum, correlated with dementia status.
RESULTS: Although there was no granular layer (GL) cell loss, GL area was lower in AD cases, particularly in the lateral cerebellum. Lower numbers of mossy fiber synaptic terminals in the cerebellar GL of AD cases correlated with Braak stages IV-VI. PF content weight correlated with dementia independently of age, neuropathology, and education. In addition, we found that a measure of the relative size of the PF content weight to total brain weight correlated with less dementia.
DISCUSSION: These results confirm that the cerebellum is not spared neuropathological damage in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Novel evidence of cerebellar atrophy in the granule cell layer of the lateral cerebellar cortex (or 'cognitive cerebellum'), and loss of a specific cerebellar synapse type in this region, the cerebellar glomerulus. Both correlated with dementia status and Braak stages IV through VI, in a cohort with complete neuropathological characterization. Although there have been recent brain imaging studies suggesting a role for cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease, we believe our study constitutes some of the most concrete neuropathological evidence to date of anatomic and synaptic substrates that are disrupted in AD. These changes in this cerebellar region may even play a role in the etiology of cognitive symptoms. Novel evidence that individuals with lower postmortem cerebellar weights showed more cognitive decline, independent of classical neuropathology markers such as Braak stage, Thal phase, or Corsortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score, suggesting a role for this brain region in dementia, using advanced statistical analysis of a large unbiased population cohort (n = 605), the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. Conversely, a measure of how intact the cerebellum was correlated with less dementia, independent of classical neuropathology markers and cerebral cortical weight, again, in the ACT cohort of 605 brain donors. We believe that this novel finding has relevance and implications for the identification of resilience factors, which may protect against the development of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39944166,Multi-functional role of apolipoprotein E in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Genetic diversity in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as the major susceptibility genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). Specifically, the ApoEε4 allele is a significant risk factor for SAD, while ApoEε2 allele provides protection compared to the more common ApoEε3 allele. This review discusses the role of the ApoE in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. ApoE, a cholesterol transport protein, influences several pathways involved in neurodegeneration, particularly in AD. Beyond its established role in amyloid β-protein (Aβ) metabolism and deposition, ApoE also impacts tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and the microglial response to AD. The review aims to provide an updated overview of ApoE's diverse roles, emphasizing its involvement in Aβ clearance through ApoE receptors. It also covers ApoE's influence in other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Huntington's disease (HD), vascular dementia (VD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). New research highlights the interaction between ApoE and presenilin (PS), suggesting connections between familial AD (FAD) and SAD. The review also explores protective effects of ApoE mutations against AD and ApoE4-induced tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. The insights from this comprehensive update could indeed lead to new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39898436,Soluble Aβ pathology predicts neurodegeneration and cognitive decline independently on p-tau in the earliest Alzheimer's continuum: Evidence across two independent cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Identifying the link between early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological changes and neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals may lead to the discovery of preventive strategies. We assessed longitudinal brain atrophy and cognitive decline as a function of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in two independent cohorts of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals.
METHODS: We used longitudinal voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in combination with hippocampal subfield segmentation. Changes in neuroimaging and cognitive variables were inspected using general linear models (GLMs) adjusting by age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) status, follow-up time, and years of education.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, baseline CSF amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers significantly predicted medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy rates and episodic memory (EM) decline independently of CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau).
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that soluble Aβ dyshomeostasis triggers MTL longitudinal atrophy and EM decline independently of CSF p-tau. Our data underscore the need for secondary preventive strategies at the earliest stages of the AD pathological cascade.
HIGHLIGHTS: We assessed brain atrophy and cognitive decline in asymptomatic individuals. Aβ biomarkers predicted MTL atrophy independently of p-tau. Our results underscore the importance of undertaking Alzheimer's preclinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39709485,Brain derived β-interferon is a potential player in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Recent research has postulated that the activation of cGAS-STING-interferon signalling pathways could be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise types of interferons and related cytokines, both from the brain and periphery, responsible for cognitive impairment in patients with AD remain unclear.
METHODS: A total of 131 participants (78 [59.5%] female and 53 [40.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [7.6] years) with normal cognition and cognitive impairment from the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Initiative cohort were included. CSF and serum IFNα-2a, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1and CXCL-10 were tested. The correlation between these interferons and related cytokines with AD core biomarkers in the CSF and plasma, cognition performance, and brain MRI measures were analysed.
RESULTS: We found that only CSF IFN-β levels were significantly elevated in Alzheimer's disease compared to normal cognition. Furthermore, CSF IFN-β levels were significantly associated with AD core biomarkers (CSF P-tau and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio) and cognitive performance (MMSE and CDR score). Additionally, the CSF IFN-β levels were significantly correlated with the typical pattern of brain atrophy in AD (such as hippocampus, amygdala, and precuneus). In contrast, CSF IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in non-AD cognitively impaired patients compared to other groups. Moreover, CSF IL-6 levels were significantly associated with cognitive performance in non-AD individuals and correlated with the vascular cognitive impairment-related MRI markers (such as white matter hyperintensity).
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that distinct inflammatory molecules are associated with different cognitive disorders. Notably, CSF IFN-β levels are significantly linked to the pathology and cognitive performance of AD, identifying this interferon as a potential target for AD therapy.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39868381,Retinal biomarkers for the risk of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.,"PURPOSE: Differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be challenging due to overlapping cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Evidence regarding non-invasive and early-stage biomarkers remains limited. Our aim was to identify retinal biomarkers for the risk of AD and FTD in populations without dementia and explore underlying brain structural mechanisms.
METHODS: We included a total of 3,0573 UK Biobank participants without dementia, ocular disorders, and diabetes who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between macular OCT parameters and the risk of AD and FTD. Mediation analysis was used to explore the underlying mechanisms affected by brain structures.
RESULTS: The mean age at recruitment was 55.27, and 46.10% of the participants were male. During a mean follow-up of 9.15 ± 2.59 years, 148 patients with AD and eight patients with FTD were identified. Reduced thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) at baseline was associated with an increased risk of AD (HR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.001-1.066; P = 0.044), while thinner retinal pigment epithelial in the inner superior subfield at baseline was associated with an elevated risk of FTD (HR, 1.409; 95% CI, 1.060-1.871; P = 0.018). Structurally abnormal visual pathways, including cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes, as well as white matter integrity, mediated the association between the GC-IPL thickness and AD risk.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide preliminary empirical support for a relationship between prodromal changes in retinal layers and a higher risk of AD or FTD, suggesting that macular OCT may serve as a non-invasive, sensitive biomarker of high-risk years before the onset of dementia.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40095677,Alzheimer's disease-like features in resting state EEG/fMRI of cognitively intact and healthy middle-aged APOE/PICALM risk carriers.,"BackgroundGenetic susceptibility is a primary factor contributing to etiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The exact mechanisms and timeline through which APOE/PICALM influence brain functions and contribute to LOAD remain unidentified. This includes their effects on individuals prior to the development of the disease.ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of APOE and PICALM risk genes on brain health and function in non-demented individuals. This study aims to differentiate the combined risk effects of both genes from the risk associated solely with APOE, and to examine how PICALM alleles influence the risk linked to APOE.MethodsAPOE/PICALM alleles were assessed to determine the genetic risk of LOAD in 79 healthy, middle-aged participants who underwent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. The resting-state signal was analyzed to estimate relative spectral power, complexity (Higuchi's algorithm), and connectivity (coherence in EEG and independent component analysis-based connectivity in fMRI).ResultsThe main findings indicated that individuals at risk for LOAD exhibited reduced signal complexity and the so-called ""slowing of EEG"" which are well-known EEG markers of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, these individuals showed altered functional connectivity in fMRI (within attention-related areas).ConclusionsRisk alleles of APOE/PICALM may affect brain integrity and function prior to the clinical onset of the disease.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40163795,"Grief and Economic Stressors by Sex, Gender, and Education: Associations With Alzheimer Disease-Related Outcomes.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence and impact of stressful life events (SLEs) on age-related and Alzheimer disease (AD)-related pathways may depend on social determinants including gender and education. We investigated whether specific SLEs are associated with AD pathology and neurodegeneration and how these associations differ by gender and education.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included cognitively unimpaired participants, most with a family history of sporadic AD, from the ALzheimer's and FAmilies (ALFA) cohort, based in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had available assessments on occurrence and type of lifetime SLEs and lumbar puncture and/or structural MRI. We performed multiple regression analyses to examine the associations of specific SLE type with (1) AD pathologies (CSF phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181] and β-amyloid [Aβ] 42/40) and (2) neurodegeneration markers (CSF neurogranin and GM volumes voxel-wise) including interaction and stratification analyses by gender (women/men) and education.
RESULTS: In total, 1,290 cognitively unimpaired participants (mean age = 59.4 years, range: 48-77 years, 99% White participants, 61% women) were included (393 with lumbar puncture and 1,234 with spectroscopic MRI assessments). Less educated participants and women reported more grief-related and economic-related SLEs. Furthermore, women reported more abuse and reproductive SLEs. Grief-related SLEs were associated with AD and neurodegeneration CSF outcomes while economic SLEs were associated with MRI-based GM outcomes, both in an age-independent manner. Specifically, partner's death was associated with lower Aβ42/40 (B = -5.19; 95% CI -9.61 to -0.76; p = 0.022) and higher p-tau181 (B = 0.18; 95% CI 0.05-0.32; p = 0.007) and neurogranin (B = 0.19; 95% CI 0.05-0.32; p = 0.007). The associations with Aβ42/40 were driven by less educated participants and men and associations with p-tau181 and neurogranin driven by women. Unemployment and economic loss were associated with lower GM volumes in limbic and frontal areas, driven by more educated participants and men and by women, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Older adults at risk of cognitive decline with less education and women may be more susceptible to experience more SLEs. Men who have experienced widowhood and unemployment and women who have experienced financial difficulties may benefit from interventions.",Neurology,2025
39817469,APOE4 impact on soluble and insoluble tau pathology is mostly influenced by amyloid-beta.,"The APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). While APOE4 is strongly associated with amyloid-beta (Aβ), its relationship with tau accumulation is less understood. Studies evaluating the role of APOE4 on tau accumulation showed conflicting results, particularly regarding the independence of these associations from Aβ load. In this study, we examined three independent longitudinal cohorts (BioFINDER-1, BioFINDER-2 and WRAP) in which participants had cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of tau tangles (tau-PET; temporal meta-ROI and entorhinal) or soluble p-tau (p-tau217), Aβ-PET and APOE genotype. The study included a total of 1370 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 449 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, followed longitudinally with tau-PET and p-tau217. APOE4 carriers accounted for 40.2-50% of the cohorts. Different linear regressions (cross-sectional) and linear mixed-effect models (longitudinal) with tau measures as outcomes were fitted to test the effect of APOE4 as independent predictor, as well as in combination with baseline Aβ load (including interaction). All models included age, sex and cognitive status as covariates. We found no independent effects of the APOE4 carriership on insoluble tau in either cohort (BioFINDER-2 or WRAP), both on cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-PET in the temporal meta-ROI, when Aβ was present in the model (p=0.531-0.949). Aβ alone was the best predictor of insoluble tau accumulation, with no interaction between APOE4 and Aβ on tau-PET. In BioFINDER-2, there was a significant interaction between APOE4 and Aβ (b=0.166, p<0.001) in the entorhinal cortex at baseline. However, the interaction was not present in WRAP PET. No independent effects of the APOE4 carriership on baseline (p=0.683-0.708) and longitudinal (p=0.188-0.570) soluble p-tau217 were observed when Aβ was included in the model in BioFINDER-1 and WRAP. Similarly, no interaction between APOE4 and Aβ on soluble p-tau217 was observed. Mediation analysis revealed that Aβ load fully mediated most associations between APOE4 and tau (46-112%, either cross-sectional or longitudinal tau-PET or soluble p-tau217). In the largest cohort (BioFINDER-2), looking at APOE4 groups by number of ε4 alleles, we found an interaction between APOE4 homozygotes and Aβ on tau-PET levels at baseline and over time in the temporal meta-ROI, while in the entorhinal cortex this effect was observed only at baseline. In conclusion, although APOE4 is strongly associated with Aβ aggregation, it seems to be minimally associated with longitudinal changes in soluble or insoluble p-tau levels at a given level of Aβ pathology, confirming the primacy of Aβ in driving tau pathology.",Brain,2025
40098158,Perivascular space and white matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease: associations with disease progression and cognitive function.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles. Recent studies emphasize the role of vascular factors, including the glymphatic system, in AD pathogenesis, particularly in Aβ clearance. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS; ALPS-Index) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive method to evaluate the glymphatic system in vivo, showing glymphatic insufficiency in AD. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the function of the glymphatic system in individuals with AD versus healthy controls (HC), and to explore its association with Aβ, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cognitive function.
METHODS: DTI MRI data from three independent study cohorts (ActiGliA: AD n = 16, Controls n = 18; DELCODE: AD n = 54, Controls n = 67; ADNI: AD n = 43, Controls n = 49) were used to evaluate the perivascular space (PVS) integrity; a potential biomarker for glymphatic activity. The DTI-Along the Perivascular Space technique was used to measure water diffusion along PVS providing an index to assess the efficiency of the glymphatic system's waste clearance function. WMH load was quantified in FLAIR MRI using the lesion segmentation tool. We quantified WMHs volume within our defined region of interest (ROI) and excluded participants with any WMHs to avoid confounding the ALPS-Index. Associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD hallmark biomarkers, cognitive performance (MMSE) and clinical severity (CDR) were assessed.
RESULTS: AD patients had a significantly lower ALPS-Index vs. healthy controls (ActiGliA: AD: mean = 1.22, SD = 0.12; Controls: mean = 1.36, SD = 0.14, p = 0.004; DELCODE: AD: mean = 1.26, SD = 0.18; Controls: mean = 1.34, SD = 0.2, p = 0.035; ADNI: AD: mean = 1.08, SD = 0.24; Controls: mean = 1.19, SD = 0.13, p = 0.008). The ALPS-Index was associated with CSF Aβ concentration, WMH number and MMSE and CDR. WMH, found in the ROIs correlated negatively with the ALPS-Index.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of the DTI-ALPS-Index as a biomarker for glymphatic dysfunction in AD. It underscores the importance of considering vascular factors and the glymphatic system in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of AD as WMHs in the ROI could cause disturbances and inaccurate indices.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39694821,How well do plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers reflect the CSF amyloid status?,"BACKGROUND: Can plasma biomarkers as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) perform in the separation of amyloid-beta-positive (Aβ+) vs amyloid-beta-negative (Aβ-) groups across an age range seen in an NHS cognitive disorder clinic?
METHODS: As part of the routine diagnostic investigation of 111 clinic patients who had contemporaneous blood and CSF samples taken, patients were categorised into Aβ+ and Aβ- groups based on their CSF in an Aβ42/40 ratio. We then evaluated four single molecule array (Simoa) Quanterix assays, quantifying single plasma analytes and ratios (p-tau217, p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio, p-tau181, p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio and Aβ42/40 ratio) in their ability to distinguish between these groups and the effect of age.
RESULTS: The median (range) age of participants was 66 (55-79) years with 48 females (43.2%). The areas under the curve (AUC), not accounting for age, for the ability to discriminate Aβ+ from Aβ- groups were plasma p-tau217 AUC=0.94, Aβ42/40 AUC=0.78 and p-tau181 AUC=0.77. Combining p-tau217/Aβ42 increased the AUC to 0.97. The difference between the groups was influenced by age with less separation in older individuals: a significant negative interaction term between age and group for plasma p-tau217 concentrations (-0.037, p=0.013) and p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio (-0.007, p=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: There was variable performance of plasma biomarkers to recapitulate the CSF assay. Both p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 showed excellent promise as surrogates of CSF amyloid status, although with slightly reduced performance in older individuals. There was poorer discriminatory ability for p-tau181 and Aβ42/40. Further research is needed to address potential age-related confounds.",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,2025
39877076,Association of CSF soluble TREM1 levels with hippocampal atrophy in cognitively impaired older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (sTREM1) are elevated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the relationship between CSF sTREM1 and hippocampal atrophy remains to be elucidated. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between CSF sTREM1 levels and longitudinal changes in hippocampal volumes, and to determine if this relationship is moderated by cognitive status.
METHODS: We included 576 participants, comprising 152 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 424 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals. In the cross-sectional analyses, Pearson's correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship between baseline CSF sTREM1 levels and hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI participants. For the longitudinal analyses, a linear mixed-effects model was employed to assess the significance of the three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time on adjusted hippocampal volume (aHV). Further stratified analyses based on cognitive status were performed to dissect the specific effects within each group.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed significantly elevated baseline CSF sTREM1 levels in CI participants compared to CU participants. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that CSF sTREM1 levels were negatively associated with hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI participants. In the longitudinal analyses, the three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time was found to be significant for aHV. Stratified analyses indicated that, in CI participants, higher CSF sTREM1 levels were associated with a more accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy, whereas no such association was observed in CU participants.
CONCLUSION: These results underscore the complex interplay between neuroinflammation, as reflected by CSF sTREM1 levels, hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline. The data suggest that neuroinflammation may contribute differently to hippocampal atrophy rates in CI versus CU individuals, highlighting the potential for targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in the prevention and treatment of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40033427,Synaptic protein CSF levels relate to memory scores in individuals without dementia.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated how cerebrospinal fluid levels of synaptic proteins associate with memory function in normal cognition (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and investigated the effect of amyloid positivity on these associations.
METHODS: We included 242 CN (105(43%) abnormal amyloid), and 278 MCI individuals (183(66%) abnormal amyloid) from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For 181 (EMIF-AD MBD) and 36 (ADNI) proteins with a synaptic annotation in SynGO, associations with word learning recall were analysed with linear models.
RESULTS: Subsets of synaptic proteins showed lower levels with worse recall in preclinical AD (EMIF-AD MBD: 7, ADNI: 5 proteins, none overlapping), prodromal AD (EMIF-AD MBD only, 27 proteins) and non-AD MCI (EMIF-AD MBD: 1, ADNI: 7 proteins). The majority of these associations were specific to these clinical groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Synaptic disturbance-related memory impairment occurred very early in AD, indicating it may be relevant to develop therapies targeting the synapse early in the disease.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40067298,Sex Differences in Apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer Disease Pathology Across Ancestries.,"IMPORTANCE: Age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are the strongest risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The role of APOE in AD varies with sex and ancestry. While the association of APOE with AD biomarkers also varies across sex and ancestry, no study has systematically investigated both sex-specific and ancestry differences of APOE on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together, resulting in limited insights and generalizability.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate the association of sex and APOE-ε4 with 3 core CSF biomarkers across ancestries.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examined 3 CSF biomarkers (amyloid β1-42 [Aβ42], phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau], and total tau, in participants from 20 cohorts from July 1, 1985, to March 31, 2020. These individuals were grouped into African, Asian, and European ancestries based on genetic data. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2023, to November 10, 2024.
EXPOSURE: Sex (male or female) and APOE-ε4.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The associations of sex and APOE-ε4 with biomarker levels were assessed within each ancestry group, adjusting for age. Meta-analyses were performed to identify these associations across ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to exclude the potential influence of the APOE-ε2 allele.
RESULTS: This cohort study included 4592 individuals (mean [SD] age, 70.8 [10.2] years; 2425 [52.8%] female; 119 [2.6%] African, 52 [1.1%] Asian, and 4421 [96.3%] European). Higher APOE-ε4 dosage scores were associated with lower Aβ42 values (β [SE], -0.58 [0.02], P < .001), indicating more severe pathology; these associations were seen in men and women separately and jointly. The association with APOE-ε4 was statistically greater in men (β [SE], -0.63 [0.03]; P < .001) vs women (β [SE], -0.52 [0.03]; P < .001) of European ancestry (P = .01 for interaction). Women had higher levels of p-tau, indicating more severe neurofibrillary pathology. The association between APOE-ε4 dosage and p-tau was in the expected direction (higher APOE-ε4 dosage for higher p-tau values) in both sexes, but the difference between sexes was significant only in those of African ancestry (β [SE], 0.10 [0.18]; P = .57 for men; β [SE], 0.66 [0.17]; P < .001 for women; P = .03 for interaction). Women also had higher levels of total tau, indicating more neuronal damage. The association between APOE-ε4 dosage and total tau was stronger in women than in men in the African cohort (β [SE], 0.20 [0.22]; P = .36 for men and β [SE], 0.65 [0.22], P = .004 for women [P = .16 for interaction]) and European cohort (β [SE], 0.36 [0.03]; P < .001 in women and β [SE], 0.27 [0.03], P < .001 in men [P = .053 for interaction]); no significant associations were found in the Asian cohort. Sensitivity analysis excluding APOE-ε2 carriers yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the association of the APOE-ε4 risk allele with tau accumulation was higher in women than in men. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex differences in APOE-ε4's association with AD biomarkers and tau pathology mechanisms in AD. Although this study provides robust evidence of complex interplay between sex and APOE-ε4 for European ancestry, further research is needed to fully understand other ancestry differences.",JAMA Netw Open,2025
40175345,Inhibition of tau neuronal internalization using anti-tau single domain antibodies.,"In Alzheimer's disease, tau pathology spreads across brain regions as the disease progresses. Intracellular tau can be released and taken up by nearby neurons. We evaluated single domain anti-tau antibodies, also called VHHs, as inhibitors of tau internalization. We identified three VHH inhibitors of tau uptake: A31, H3-2, and Z70<sub>mut1</sub>. These VHHs compete with the membrane protein LRP1, a major receptor mediating neuronal uptake of tau. A31 and Z70<sub>mut1</sub> bind to microtubule binding domain repeats, which are involved in the interaction with LRP1. VHH H3-2 is the only VHH from our library that reduces the internalization of both monomeric tau and tau fibrils. VHH H3-2 binds a C-terminal tau epitope with high affinity. Its three-dimensional structure in complex with a tau peptide reveals a unique binding mode as a VHH-swapped dimer. These anti-tau VHHs are interesting tools to study tau prion-like propagation in tauopathies and potentially develop novel biotherapies.",Nat Commun,2025
40145360,Social cognition in mild cognitive impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Social cognition is impaired in people with dementia but the differences in social cognitive impairment between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and its subtypes remain unclear. We therefore aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze differences in emotion recognition, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy between individuals with MCI and dementia. Across 28 cross-sectional studies (n = 2409), people with MCI had better emotion recognition (Cohen's d = 0.69) and ToM (d = 0.70) than individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and larger effect sizes were observed for people with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (emotion recognition (d = 2.09), ToM (d = 1.49), but emotional empathy was higher in AD than in MCI in included studies. Our findings suggest a progressive decline of aspects of social cognition across the MCI-dementia continuum. Longitudinal studies should investigate the diagnostic role of social cognition deficits in MCI progression to dementia, and interventions for social cognition in MCI should be developed and tested. HIGHLIGHTS: First systematic review and meta-analysis comparing social cognition between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia subtypes. Findings from 28 studies with 2409 participants show people with MCI outperform those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in emotion recognition and theory of mind. Empathy appears intact in AD dementia, suggesting that this cognitive domain is preserved throughout disease progression. Evaluation of social cognition should be built into dementia assessment as it may hold diagnostic value.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39814774,"Gelatin/PLA-loaded gold nanocomposites synthesis using Syzygium cumini fruit extract and their antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and anti-Alzheimer's activities.","Nanotechnology has experienced significant advancements, attracting considerable attention in various biomedical applications.

Furthermore, it presents an attractive and promising approach for various future biomedical applications.",Sci Rep,2025
39905093,Integrative bioinformatic approach reveals novel melatonin-related biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Melatonin (MLT) can improve mitophagy, thereby ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Hence, our research focused on the potential value of MLT-related genes (MRGs) in AD through bioinformatic analysis.
METHODS: First, the key cells in the single-cell dataset GSE138852 were screened out based on the proportion of annotated cells and Fisher's test between the AD and control groups. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the key cell and GSE5281 datasets were identified, and the MRGs in GSE5281 were selected via weighted gene coexpression network analysis. After intersecting two sets of DEGs and MRGs, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis to identify the MRGs causally related to AD. Biomarkers were further ascertained through receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and expression analysis in GSE5281 and GSE48350. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis and correlation analysis with metabolic pathways were conducted, as well as construction of a regulator network and molecular docking.
RESULTS: According to the Fisher test, oligodendrocytes were regarded as key cells due to their excellent abundance in the GSE138852 dataset, in which there were 281 DEGs between the AD and control groups. After overlapping with 3,490 DEGs and 550 MRGs in GSE5281, four genes were found to be causally related to AD, namely, G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member B (GPRC5B), Methyltransferase-like protein 7 A (METTL7A), NF-κB inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA) and RAS association domain family 4(RASSF4). Moreover, GPRC5B, NFKBIA and RASSF4 were deemed biomarkers, except for METTL7A, because of their indistinctive expression between the AD and control groups. Biomarkers might be involved in oxidative phosphorylation, adipogenesis and heme metabolism. Moreover, T helper type 17 cells, natural killer cells and CD56dim natural killer cells were significantly correlated with biomarkers. Transcription factors (GATA2, POU2F2, NFKB1, etc.) can regulate the expression of biomarkers. Finally, we discovered that all biomarkers could bind to MLT with a strong binding energy.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified three novel biomarkers related to MLT for AD, namely, GPRC5B, NFKBIA and RASSF4, providing a novel approach for the investigation and treatment of AD patients.",Sci Rep,2025
39757626,Advances in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by gradual onset and complex pathological mechanisms. Clinically, it presents with progressive cognitive decline and behavioral impairments, making it one of the most common causes of dementia. The intricacies of its pathogenesis are not fully understood, and current treatment options are limited, with diagnosis typically occurring at intermediate to advanced stages. The development of new biomarkers offers a crucial avenue for the early diagnosis of AD and improving patient outcomes. Several biomarkers with high specificity have been identified. This article reviews biomarkers related to tau protein, β-amyloid, and blood cells to deepen our understanding of AD and emphasize the advantages and disadvantages of various biomarkers in order to explore further and mine new biomarkers for AD diagnosis.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
39766438,Clearing Amyloid-Beta by Astrocytes: The Role of Rho GTPases Signaling Pathways as Potential Therapeutic Targets.,"Astrocytes, vital support cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are crucial for maintaining neuronal health. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), astrocytes play a key role in clearing toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Aβ, a potent neuroinflammatory trigger, stimulates astrocytes to release excessive glutamate and inflammatory factors, exacerbating neuronal dysfunction and death. Recent studies underscore the role of Rho GTPases-particularly RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42-in regulating Aβ clearance and neuroinflammation. These key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways function independently through distinct mechanisms but may converge to modulate inflammatory responses. Their influence on astrocyte structure and function extends to regulating endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity, which modulates vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (ET-1). Through these processes, Rho GTPases impact vascular permeability and neuroinflammation, contributing to AD pathogenesis by affecting both Aβ clearance and cerebrovascular interactions. Understanding the interplay between Rho GTPases and the cerebrovascular system provides fresh insights into AD pathogenesis. Targeting Rho GTPase signaling pathways in astrocytes could offer a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate neuroinflammation, enhance Aβ clearance, and slow disease progression, ultimately improving cognitive outcomes in AD patients.",Brain Sci,2024
40194078,Higher Serum Vitamin B6 and B12 Levels Associated with Parkinson's Disease Incidence (P2-5.003).,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of baseline serum vitamin B12, B6, and folate levels on risk of incident Parkinson's disease (PD) among participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).
BACKGROUND: B vitamins (B12, B6, folate) have been proposed as protective against developing PD. Higher intake of B12 and B6 is associated with lower PD risk and folate and vitamin B12 levels are lower in people with PD. Given substantial variability between vitamin intake and serum levels, we sought to determine associations between serum vitamin levels collected in unaffected individuals and risk of incident PD.
DESIGN/METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data in the Original (exam 20: 1986-1990) and Offspring (exam 5: 1991-1995) cohorts from the FHS. Participants were included if data were available for PD diagnosis status, baseline serum vitamin levels (B12, B6, folate), and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Exclusion criteria included PD diagnosis at FHS entry or within 5 years. Dietary intake of vitamins was ascertained using FFQ. Primary outcome measure was PD incidence. Results were adjusted for age, sex, dietary intake, and cohort effect. Similar analyses were completed for incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: 2,757 participants (mean age 59.7[SD, 12.4], 45.8% men) followed on average for 19.4[SD, 6.1] years were included. With surveillance beginning 5 years after entry, there were 40 incident PD cases. The highest tertiles of serum B12 (HR 2.27 [95% CI 1.04, 4.95], p=0.040) and B6 (HR 2.96 [1.24, 7.07], p=0.015) levels were associated with incident PD, but not vitamin intake. Higher serum vitamin levels were not associated with incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Higher dietary intake of vitamins was not associated with incident PD.
CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal population study, higher B12 and B6 serum levels were associated with an increased risk of incident PD. The reasons for this unexpected association are unknown and require further investigation.

39880856,"Exploring the Association Between Overactive Bladder (OAB) and Cognitive decline: mediation by depression in elderly adults,   a NHANES weighted analysis.","Overactive bladder (OAB) is a prevalent condition among older adults and may be linked to cognitive health. This study explored a relationship between OAB and cognitive health among adults aged 60 ≥ years in the United States, using NHANES 2011-2014. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using a nationally representative sample of 2,324 (45.95% male, 54.05% female), within 755 individuals have OAB. Cognitive health was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease-Word Learning (CERAD W-L), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). OAB was defined by a score more than 3 on the Overactive Bladder Syndrome Symptom Score (OABSS). Depression incidence was also recorded. Weighted linear regression models adjusted for demographic, behavioral factors, and comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease etc.), were employed to examine the independent association between cognitive health and OAB. The results indicated that cognitive scores were significantly lower in the OAB group compared to the non-OAB group across all cognitive tests (p<0.001). The incidence of depression was significantly higher in the OAB group (15%) compared to the non-OAB group (6.05%) (p<0.001). Regression analysis revealed that a 14% decrease in cognitive health z-scores in patients with OAB (β=-0.14, CI (95%) [-0.22, -0.06]). Furthermore, depression was found to mediate 34.56% of the association between OAB and cognitive health relationship [CI (95%): 0.20, 0.69]. This negative association was robust in subgroups by demographics, behavioral factors, and comorbidities. This study's findings, supported by mediation analysis, smoothed curve analysis, and sensitivity analysis, suggest that lower cognitive health is significantly associated with OAB, and depression plays an important mediating role in this association.",Sci Rep,2025
40112274,Incidence of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities in Phase III Clinical Trials of Anti-Amyloid-β Immunotherapy: An Updated Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are key safety considerations in anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapy. ARIA can be categorized into 2 types: ARIA characterized by edema and effusion (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages and superficial siderosis (ARIA-H). In this study, we assessed the incidence of ARIA in phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-Aβ immunotherapy and compared the incidence among different agents and APOE ε4 carrier status.
METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were searched for phase 3 RCTs of anti-Aβ immunotherapy published on or before May 23, 2024. The inclusion criteria were phase 3 trials of anti-Aβ immunotherapy for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease (AD) or mild AD dementia, with sufficient data on ARIA-E/H. The pooled incidences of ARIA and subgroup analyses according to various agents and APOE ε4 carrier status were calculated. A sensitivity analysis excluding outliers was performed. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of ARIA-E according to the APOE ε4 carrier status was also calculated.
RESULTS: Nine phase 3 RCT cohorts from 8 eligible studies were identified, analyzing data from 6,315 patients. The pooled incidence of ARIA-E was 9.5% (95% CI 2.8%-27.3%), and the adjusted pooled incidence of ARIA-E was 25.5% (95% CI 20.4%-31.8%) in the sensitivity analysis. The pooled incidence of symptomatic ARIA-E was 6.7% (95% CI 3.5%-12.5%) and that of severe ARIA-E was 3.5% (95% CI 13.8%-8.4%). The pooled incidence of ARIA-H was 17.8% (95% CI 11.0%-27.5%), with the incidence of superficial siderosis was 9.3% (95% CI 6.1%-13.9%). The pooled incidence of isolated ARIA-H was 8.7% (95% CI 7.6%-10.1%). Subgroup analysis showed that homozygous APOE ε4 carriers had significantly higher odds of developing ARIA-E (OR 5.6, 95% CI 3.8-8.2, p &lt; 0.001) than noncarriers. Heterozygous APOE ε4 carriers also had significantly higher odds of developing ARIA-E (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.4, p &lt; 0.001) than noncarriers.
DISCUSSION: Although limited by small sample size and cohort-level data, our meta-analysis shows the adjusted pooled incidence of ARIA-E was 25.5% and the pooled incidence of ARIA-H was 17.8% in the recent phase 3 RCTs of anti-Aβ immunotherapy. Homozygous APOE ε4 carriers have a 5.6-fold higher risk of developing ARIA-E than noncarriers.",Neurology,2025
40017898,Impact of study partner replacement in a mild cognitive impairment clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, including trials enrolling patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), participants must enroll with a study partner (SP). SPs ensure compliance and are a source of study data, including assessments of the participant's cognition and function. Consistency in SP reporting is essential to trial data integrity.
METHODS: We quantified SP replacement and its impact on bias and variance of SP-reported AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for MCI (ADCS-ADL-MCI) in the ADCS Vitamin E/Donepezil MCI Trial. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between SP type (spouse or non-spouse) and the odds of experiencing SP change. We used generalized estimating equations to longitudinally model the differences in consecutively recorded ADCS-ADL-MCI scores as a function of whether SP change occurred. We used a similar model to quantify end-of-study change from baseline in ADCS-ADL-MCI scores.
RESULTS: Among 768 participants, 40 (5%) experienced at least one SP change. We estimated that the odds of experiencing a SP change were 65% lower for spousal dyads when compared to non-spousal dyads (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.18-0.67]). Compared to those with a consistent SP, participants who experienced a SP change had, on average, a consecutive visit absolute score difference that was 1.60 points greater in magnitude (95% CI: [0.62-2.57]), suggesting greater volatility. ADCS-ADL-MCI scores were neither systematically higher nor lower when SP change occurred, on average (-0.23; 95% CI: [-1.60, 1.14]), suggesting minimal bias. The estimated difference in variance for end-of-study change from baseline ADCS-ADL-MCI was observed to be higher for those with SP change compared to those without, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.29; 95% CI: [0.47-1.17]).
CONCLUSION: SP replacement occurred for a meaningful number of participants but did not result in systematic bias on a functional outcome in this trial, but it did increase variability.Highlights: Among participants in a mild cognitive impairment trial, approximately 5% experienced at least one study partner replacement.The estimated odds of replacement were 60% lower for participants with a spousal study partner at baseline, compared to those with a non-spouse partner.We observed increased variance, but not bias, in the mean within-participant change in consecutive ADCS-ADL-MCI scores among participants experiencing study partner replacement.We observed greater variance for end-of-study change from baseline ADCS-ADL-MCI for those who experienced a study partner replacement, compared to those who did not.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39975931,A novel blood-free analytical framework for the quantification of neuroinflammatory load from TSPO PET Imaging.,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is critical for neuroinflammation studies but faces substantial methodological challenges. These include issues with arterial blood sampling for kinetic modeling, the absence of suitable reference regions, genetic polymorphisms affecting tracer affinity, altered blood-to-brain tracer delivery in inflammatory conditions, and high signal variability. This study presents a novel blood-free reference-free method for TSPO PET quantification, leveraging a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of TSPO overexpression across brain regions. Validation was performed on 323 human brain scans from five datasets and three radiotracers. The quantified TSPO topology in healthy controls showed strong concordance with the constitutive TSPO gene expression for all tracers. When using [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 PET data, the method replicated previous findings in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, and XBD173 blocking. However, model extension to [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 and [<sup>11</sup>C]-(R)-PK11195 revealed small effect sizes and high variability, suggesting the need for tracer-specific model optimization. Finally, validation in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation confirmed previous evidence of increased brain TSPO uptake after a systemic challenge. This novel non-invasive method provides individualized TSPO PET quantification, demonstrating broad applicability across TSPO PET tracers and imaging sites, assuming sufficient training data for model development.",Res Sq,2025
40016275,Serum-tolerant polymeric complex for stem-cell transfection and neural differentiation.,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy holds promise in biomedical applications but faces challenges in efficient transfection without compromising cell viability. Here, we show a serum-tolerant MSC transfection nanotool, APOs@BP, composed of an apolipoprotein (APO) corona and a boronated polyethyleneimine (BP) core. The APOs corona's serum-protein resistance and cytomembrane affinity enable APOs@BP to achieve 10.4-fold higher transfection efficiency and improved cytocompatibility in serum-containing medium compared to high-molecular-weight polycationic transfectants. For MSC neural differentiation, miRNA-124 and all-trans retinoic acid derivative (atRAN) are further loaded into APOs@BP, forming a polymeric complex for sequential drug release triggered by lysosomal acid and cytosolic reactive oxygen species post-transplantation. Transcriptomic analysis confirms that this system enhances MSC neural differentiation through sequential activation of atRAN-induced differentiation potential and miRNA-124-directed neurogenesis via cGMP-PKG, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt pathways. Transplantation of engineered MSCs reconstructs neural circuits and alleviates cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Collectively, this system provides a robust and convenient method for MSC-based regenerative medicine.",Nat Commun,2025
40193944,Towards Identifying an Optimal Time for Amyloid Assessment with Donanemab Treatment (S23.004).,"OBJECTIVE: Elucidate the optimal timing for assessing a patient's amyloid level in response to donanemab treatment through the use of real-world data.
BACKGROUND: Dosing with donanemab may be stopped if amyloid plaques are reduced to minimal levels based on amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Therefore, guidance on when to assess amyloid levels for potential treatment discontinuation would be valuable to clinicians.
DESIGN/METHODS: The exposure-response (amyloid plaque) model (ERM, Gueorguieva et al, ADPD-2024), established based on data from three clinical trials investigating donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), was used to simulate amyloid reduction following the dosing regimen per the United States prescribing information. To better represent the range of baseline amyloid levels seen in clinical practice, this model included baseline amyloid PET scans collected in a real-world setting from amyloid-positive symptomatic participants (N= 3961) of the original Imaging Dementia - Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study.
RESULTS: Assuming no dosing pauses, average amyloid reductions of 47, 63, and 68 CL were achieved at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months, respectively. The estimated proportion of patients who reached the amyloid threshold of <24.1 CL, which is consistent with a negative amyloid PET scan by visual interpretation, was 45%, 71% and 78% after 6, 12 and 18 months of treatment, respectively. On average, more time was required to reach the post-treatment amyloid threshold for patients with higher baseline amyloid levels. In addition, the effect of various treatment disruption scenarios on amyloid reduction rate and appropriate timing for assessments will be presented.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings will offer insight for clinicians on when to consider conducting an amyloid PET scan to determine if a patient treated with donanemab has attained the desired amyloid reduction and can discontinue treatment.

39822132,Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles as a liquid biopsy for brain insulin dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel blood-based biomarkers for various pathologies. The development of methods to enrich cell-specific EVs from biofluids has enabled us to monitor difficult-to-access organs, such as the brain, in real time without disrupting their function, thus serving as liquid biopsy. Burgeoning evidence indicates that the contents of neuron-derived EVs (NDEs) in blood reveal dynamic alterations that occur during neurodegenerative pathogenesis, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), reflecting a disease-specific molecular signature. Among these AD-specific molecular changes is brain insulin-signaling dysregulation, which cannot be assessed clinically in a living patient and remains an unexplained co-occurrence during AD pathogenesis. This review is focused on delineating how NDEs in the blood may begin to close the gap between identifying molecular changes associated with brain insulin dysregulation reliably in living patients and its connection to AD. This approach could lead to the identification of novel early and less-invasive diagnostic molecular biomarkers for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEs) could be isolated from peripheral blood. NDEs in blood reflect the molecular signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain insulin-signaling dysregulation plays a critical role in AD. NDEs in blood could predict brain insulin-signaling dysregulation.

40096550,Sildenafil and risk of Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer Disease (AD) affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with 10 million new diagnosis each year. The link between Sildenafil, a Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor, and risk of AD has been debated. We conducted the first meta-analysis on the association between Sildenafil use and risk of AD.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to March 11, 2024 to identify cohort, case-control studies comparing the frequency of AD in patients taking Sildenafil with those without. We computed risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) with accompanying 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for each study, and pooled the results using a random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 415 studies that were screened initially, 5 studies comprising 885,380 patients were included for analysis. Sildenafil use was associated with a reduced risk of developing AD by two-fold compared to non-use (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.82, p<0.001). There was a similar association in risk reduction of AD in patients on PDE5 inhibitors compared to non-use (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.80, p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that the use of Sildenafil is associated with a reduced risk of developing AD by two-fold. Further randomized control trials to ascertain the effect of Sildenafil on AD pathology would be useful.",Aging (Albany NY),2025
39816194,"Multi-omics characterization of improved cognitive functions in Parkinson's disease patients after the combined metabolic activator treatment: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II trial.","Parkinson's disease is primarily marked by mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities. We recently reported that the combined metabolic activators improved the immunohistochemical parameters and behavioural functions in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease animal models and the cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease patients. These metabolic activators serve as the precursors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and glutathione, and they can be used to activate mitochondrial metabolism and eventually treat mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we designed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II study in Parkinson's disease patients with 84 days combined metabolic activator administration. A single dose of combined metabolic activator contains L-serine (12.35 g), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (2.55 g), nicotinamide riboside (1 g) and L-carnitine tartrate (3.73 g). Patients were administered either one dose of combined metabolic activator or a placebo daily for the initial 28 days, followed by twice-daily dosing for the next 56 days. The main goal of the study was to evaluate the clinical impact on motor functions using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and to determine the safety and tolerability of combined metabolic activator. A secondary objective was to assess cognitive functions utilizing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and to analyse brain activity through functional MRI. We also performed comprehensive plasma metabolomics and proteomics analysis for detailed characterization of Parkinson's disease patients who participated in the study. Although no improvement in motor functions was observed, cognitive function was shown to be significantly improved (P &lt; 0.0000) in Parkinson's disease patients treated with the combined metabolic activator group over 84 days, whereas no such improvement was noted in the placebo group (P &gt; 0.05). Moreover, a significant reduction (P = 0.001) in Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores was observed in the combined metabolic activator group, with no decline (P &gt; 0.05) in the placebo group among severe Parkinson's disease patients with lower baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. We showed that improvement in cognition was associated with critical brain network alterations based on functional MRI analysis, especially relevant to areas with cognitive functions in the brain. Finally, through a comprehensive multi-omics analysis, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive improvements observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Our results show that combined metabolic activator administration leads to enhanced cognitive function and improved metabolic health in Parkinson's disease patients as recently shown in Alzheimer's disease patients.

39762974,Benchmarking Alzheimer's disease prediction: personalised risk assessment using polygenic risk scores across various methodologies and genome-wide studies.,"BACKGROUND: The success of selecting high risk or early-stage Alzheimer's disease individuals for the delivery of clinical trials depends on the design and the appropriate recruitment of participants. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) show potential for identifying individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study comprehensively examines AD PRS utility using various methods and models.
METHODS: We compared the PRS prediction accuracy in ADNI (N = 568) and BioFINDER (N = 766) cohorts using five disease risk modelling approaches, three PRS derivation methods, two AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics and two sets of SNPs: the whole genome and microglia-selective regions only.
RESULTS: The best prediction accuracy was achieved when modelling genetic risk by using two predictors: APOE and remaining PRS (AUC = 0.72-0.76). Microglial PRS showed comparable accuracy to the whole genome (AUC = 0.71-0.74). The individuals' risk scores differed substantially, with the largest discrepancies (up to 70%) attributable to the GWAS statistics used.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work benchmarks the best PRS derivation and modelling strategies for AD genetic prediction.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40193777,Conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease is Associated with Lateral Tract Degeneration of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (P10-3.019).,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to determine the changes in white matter integrity of the lateral and medial Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM) tracts across time, between participants who either maintain a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or develop Alzheimer's disease (AD), to shed light on the differences that lead to progression to AD.
BACKGROUND: MCI is considered a steppingstone between normal cognitive aging and AD. The lateral and medial tracts of the NBM, which is the hub of the cortical cholinergic network, present with reduced integrity in both MCI and AD. However, there is still a lack of clarity of the relationship between white matter integrity of the NBM tracts and conversion from MCI to AD.
DESIGN/METHODS: Preliminary analysis consisted of 72 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database who underwent diffusion weighted imaging at multiple timepoints over at least 5 months. Participants were split into 54 MCI non-converters and 18 MCI converters to AD. The mean diffusivity (MD) values for the lateral and medial tracts were extracted using a previously validated NBM tract template. The percent change in NBM tracts' MD over time was calculated, and the slope was then compared between groups.
RESULTS: MCI converters showed a significant increase in the slope of percent change of MD (0.17 ± 0.11) compared to MCI non-converters (0.082 ± 0.24, p<0.01). In the medial tract there was no significant increase found between the MCI converters (0.12 ± 0.21) and MCI non-converters (0.084 ± 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: MCI converters show a greater loss of integrity of the NBM lateral tract over time as they convert to AD compared to MCI non-converters. However, no difference is observed in the medial tract. This data suggests that the lateral tract degenerates more rapidly than the medial tract in MCI to AD progression.

39972393,Distinctive autophagy/mitophagy biomarker profiles in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease.,"Maintaining cellular homeostasis by removing damaged and senescent mitochondria, a process termed mitophagy, is crucial in preventing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represents a promising therapeutic target. Our previous research revealed altered mitophagy biomarkers, such as increased CSF and serum PINK1 and serum BNIP3L and decreased serum TFEB levels, indicating impaired autophagy-lysosomal degradation in the AD continuum. However, the role of autophagy/mitophagy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) remains unclear. This study investigated the biomarkers of autophagy/mitophagy and lysosomal biogenesis (PINK1, ULK1, BNIP3L, and TFEB) in biofluids (CSF and serum) from 308 biomarker-defined individuals across the FTLD continuum (FTLD-dementia, n = 29; FTLD-MCI, n = 33) and compared them with those across the AD continuum (MCI-AD, n = 100; AD-dementia, n = 100) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls (n = 46) recruited from Czech Brain Aging Study. Additionally, we compared the mitophagy biomarkers across different FTLD clinical subtypes (frontal, semantic and nonfluent variant) with CU, and explored the association between mitophagy biomarkers and clinical phenotypes of FTLD (biomarkers of tau, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, cognition and ATN profile).Our findings indicated a significantly lower CSF PINK1 and ULK1 levels in FTLD compared to AD, with FTLD dementia showing particularly low CSF PINK1 levels compared to AD-dementia. Conversely, CSF ULK1 levels were higher in FTLD-MCI compared to AD-dementia. Serum analyses revealed lower PINK1 and higher TFEB levels in FTLD dementia compared to AD dementia. This study provides compelling evidence of distinct alterations in autophagy/mitophagy biomarkers between FTLD and AD, indicating that these neurodegenerative diseases may affect the cellular waste disposal system through different pathways. This is the first study to explore mitophagy biomarkers in human CSF and serum in FTLD, opening avenues for further research and potential clinical applications.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
40151903,Comparing patterns of impairment in social cognition between young-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundYoung-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) is defined as when the disease starts before 65 years old. Compared with late-onset AD (LOAD), the progression is faster and more aggressive. However, the impact on social cognition deficits may not follow the same clear pattern.ObjectiveThe present study aims to investigate the relationship between social cognition, global cognition, and other clinical variables in people with YOAD and LOAD and their caregivers.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional design, we included 48 people with YOAD and 118 with LOAD, and their caregivers. We assessed social cognition, global cognition, quality of life, dementia severity, mood, functionality, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver burden.ResultsThe YOAD group was more impaired in general cognition (p = 0.002, d = 0.06), had a worse quality of life (p = 0.036, d = 0.36), and presented more neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.044, d = 0.35). However, social cognition did not exhibit the same disease progression and showed no difference when compared with the reports of their caregivers or with individuals with LOAD. The multifactorial regression analyses showed that functionality was related to social cognition impairment in YOAD (p = 0.035), and LOAD (p = 0.001).ConclusionsOur study found that people diagnosed with YOAD showed more global cognitive impairment but maintained social and emotional functioning.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39894921,MicroRNA-based recent research developments in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory and physical impairment in aged individuals. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded noncoding RNAs that induce translational repression by binding to the 3' UTR of a target mRNA. miRNAs play a crucial role in neurological activity by mediating cellular proliferation, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis and more. Ongoing research in patents and clinical trials have called attention to promising miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutics in AD. Recent research has shown that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD brain, blood, cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Attenuated miRNA expressions have diagnostic potential in AD by interacting with amyloid-β synthesis, phosphorylated tau, and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, miRNA-29a, miRNA-125b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a, and miRNA-155 have shown promise as potential biomarker candidates for AD. Improving cognitive symptoms can be traced to restoring the endogenous miRNA activity by synthesizing miRNA mimics and miRNA antisense oligonucleotides. miRNA-483-5p, miRNA-188-5p, miRNA-219, miRNA135a/5p, miRNA-23/23b-3p, miRNA-124, and miRNA-455-3p are growing therapeutics for AD. However, miRNA-based therapeutics struggle outside of preclinical testing. miRNA-107, miRNA-206, miRNA-30/7, and miRNA-142-3p face bottlenecks in clinical trials due to a lack of experimental design, transparency and volunteer size. Patenting recent miRNA-based developments demonstrates the commitment in identifying a new biomarker and/or therapeutic for AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39850729,"Assessment of heart rate deceleration capacity, heart rate deceleration runs, heart rate acceleration capacity, and lipoprotein-related phospholipase A2 as predictors in individuals with dementia.","BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysfunction plays an essential role in dementia, however, it is not known whether electrocardiogram autonomic dysfunction-related indicators are associated with the severity of dementia. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether these indicators are correlated in patients with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared with normal health individuals. For this purpose, we measured and analyzed the predictive value of heart rate deceleration capacity (DC), heart rate deceleration runs (DRs), heart rate acceleration capacity (AC) along with the plasma levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2).
METHODS: We compared 83 dementia cases including 41 vascular dementia (VD), 42 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with 42 elderly health controls. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 levels were comprehensively evaluated.
RESULTS: Our studies showed that DC and DRs in VD and AD groups were significantly lower than those in controls, while AC values were significantly higher. Furthermore, the risk stratification (high- and moderate-) of DC, DRs, and AC in VD and AD groups was increased, while the low-risk was simultaneously decreased. In addition, DC and DRs were positively while AC and Lp-PLA2 were negatively correlated with MMSE scores. Logistic regression analysis indicated that DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 were associated with dementia. Moreover, the areas under the ROC curves showed that the combination of five variables and AC + Lp-PLA2 were 0.970 (95% CI, 0.923-0.992) and 0.940 (95% CI, 0.882-0.974) were larger than each single indicator alone.
CONCLUSION: Distinctive alterations in dynamic electrocardiogram-related indicators reveal a decline in autonomic nervous functions among individuals with dementia. By incorporating comprehensive analyses of DC, DRs, AC, and Lp-PLA2 values, the specificity and sensitivity of dementia diagnosis can be significantly enhanced.",Front Neurol,2024
39960847,Behavioural pharmacology predicts disrupted signalling pathways and candidate therapeutics from zebrafish mutants of Alzheimer's disease risk genes.,"By exposing genes associated with disease, genomic studies provide hundreds of starting points that should lead to druggable processes. However, our ability to systematically translate these genomic findings into biological pathways remains limited. Here, we combine rapid loss-of-function mutagenesis of Alzheimer's risk genes and behavioural pharmacology in zebrafish to predict disrupted processes and candidate therapeutics. FramebyFrame, our expanded package for the analysis of larval behaviours, revealed that decreased night-time sleep was common to F0 knockouts of all four late-onset Alzheimer's risk genes tested. We developed an online tool, ZOLTAR, which compares any behavioural fingerprint to a library of fingerprints from larvae treated with 3677 compounds. ZOLTAR successfully predicted that sorl1 mutants have disrupted serotonin signalling and identified betamethasone as a drug which normalises the excessive day-time sleep of presenilin-2 knockout larvae with minimal side effects. Predictive behavioural pharmacology offers a general framework to rapidly link disease-associated genes to druggable pathways.",Elife,2025
39816189,Brain aging rejuvenation factors in adults with genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disease.,"The largest risk factor for dementia is age. Heterochronic blood exchange studies have uncovered age-related blood factors that demonstrate 'pro-aging' or 'pro-youthful' effects on the mouse brain. The clinical relevance and combined effects of these factors for humans is unclear. We examined five previously identified brain rejuvenation factors in cerebrospinal fluid of adults with autosomal dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Our frontotemporal dementia cohort included 100 observationally followed adults carrying autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia mutations (M<sub>age</sub> = 49.6; 50% female; 43% C9orf72, 24% GRN, 33% MAPT) and 62 non-carriers (M<sub>age</sub> = 52.6; 45% female) with cerebrospinal fluid analysed on Somascan, and longitudinal (M<sub>visits</sub> = 3 years, range 1-7 years) neuropsychological and functional assessments and plasma neurofilament light chain. Our Alzheimer's disease cohort included 35 adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (M<sub>age</sub> = 69.4; 60% female) and 56 controls (M<sub>age</sub> = 68.8, 50% female) who completed the same cerebrospinal fluid and clinical outcome measures cross-sectionally. Levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, beta-2-micorglobulin, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (aka Osteocalcin) and colony stimulating factor 2 in cerebrospinal fluid were linearly combined into a composite score, with higher values reflecting 'pro-youthful' levels. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, higher baseline cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins predicted slower decline across cognitive, functional, and neurofilament light chain trajectories; estimates were similar across genotypes. In transdiagnostic analyses, higher cerebrospinal fluid rejuvenation proteins associated with better functional, cognitive, and neurofilament light chain outcomes in adults with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Proteins with pre-clinical evidence for brain rejuvenation show translational clinical relevance in adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and warrant further investigation.",Brain Commun,2025
39958263,Influence of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels on the slower age-related decline in grey matter in younger women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by excess androgens, ovulatory disorders and a higher prevalence of obesity and metabolic disturbances including Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension, some of which are risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and brain atrophy. However, it is unclear whether brain ageing occurs more rapidly in women with PCOS compared with those without PCOS. Except for the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis involved in the conventional ovulatory process, little is known regarding the role of the grey matter in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and limited existing studies examining brain structures in PCOS have shown inconsistent results. This case-control study aimed to investigate the age-related differences in total and regional brain grey matter volume and average cortical thickness in young women with and without PCOS by using brain magnetic resonance imaging to understand whether women with PCOS exhibit distinctive patterns of brain ageing, and their association with factors including obesity, hyperandrogenism and metabolic disturbances. Seventy-six women diagnosed with PCOS and 68 age-matched women without PCOS (aged 20-35 years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to measure grey matter volume and cortical thickness. Anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic measurements were conducted to assess their associations with the investigated brain structures. In women without PCOS, increasing age was significantly correlated with a decrease in global grey matter volume (r = -0.5598, P &lt; 0.0001), while this association was not significant in women with PCOS (r = -0.1475, P = 0.204). The decline in grey matter volume with age differed significantly between the two groups regardless of obesity (body mass index exceeding 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), especially in the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal regions. After adjusting for dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) levels, the negative association between age and global grey matter volume became statistically significant in women with PCOS. Increasing age was also significantly associated with a decrease in global cortical thickness in women without PCOS, but not in women with PCOS. Such negative association between global cortical thickness and age was particularly stronger in women with obesity compared with those without. The negative association between age and global cortical thickness in women with PCOS became pronounced after adjusting for DHEAS levels. Women with PCOS experience a milder grey matter loss with age compared with women without PCOS. The neuroprotective effect of high DHEAS levels in women with PCOS may be implicated in this relationship.",Brain Commun,2025
40018516,Investigation of protective effects of olanzapine on impaired learning and memory using behavioral tests in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, antioxidants may mitigate neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Aβ) and potentially reduce cell death. Previous research has demonstrated that olanzapine (OLZ) possesses antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated the protective and therapeutic effects of OLZ on an animal model of AD induced by Aβ using behavioral assessments.
METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups (n = 10 rats per group): a control group, a sham group that received an intracerebrovascular (ICV) injection of phosphate-buffered saline (the solvent for Aβ), an AD group that received an ICV injection of Aβ, an OLZ group that received OLZ via gavage for two months, and an AD + OLZ group that received OLZ for one month before and one month after AD induction.
RESULTS: We used the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT), Barnes Maze (BM), Passive Avoidance Test (PAT), and Morris Water Maze (MWM) to assess behavioral performance in the experimental rats. Aβ administration impaired cognition and increased anxiety-like behavior. Treatment with OLZ improved cognitive decline and reduced anxiety-like behavior in Aβ-infused rats.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that OLZ can restore cognitive performance and alleviate anxiety-like behavior following Aβ injection. Thus, OLZ may have both preventive and therapeutic potential for AD and could be considered a viable pharmacological option.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40156913,Multi-omic analysis of meningeal cerebral amyloid angiopathy reveals enrichment of unsubstituted glucosamine and extracellular proteins.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease in which amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in cerebral and leptomeningeal vessel walls, predisposing vessels to micro- and macro-hemorrhages. The vessel walls contain distinct proteins and heparan sulfate (HS), yet how vascular proteins and HS jointly associate with Aβ is unknown. We conducted the first multi-omics study to systematically characterize the proteins as well as the HS abundance, sulfation level, and disaccharide composition of leptomeninges from 23 moderate to severe CAA cases and controls. We then analyzed the associations between Aβ and other proteins, HS, and apolipoprotein E genotype. We found an increase in a minor HS disaccharide containing unsubstituted glucosamine, as well as 6-O sulfated disaccharides; Aβ40 levels positively correlated with unsubstituted glucosamine. There was also an increase in extracellular proteins derived from brain parenchyma or plasma, including olfactomedin-like protein 3, fibrinogen, serum amyloid protein, apolipoprotein E, and secreted frizzled related protein-3. Our findings of vascular HS and protein alterations specific to CAA-affected leptomeningeal vessels provide molecular insight into the extracellular remodeling that co-occurs with Aβ deposits and may indicate a basis for antemortem diagnostic assay development and therapeutic strategies to impede Aβ-HS interactions.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2025

39885146,Oligodendrocyte precursor cells facilitate neuronal lysosome release.,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) shape brain function through many non-canonical regulatory mechanisms beyond myelination. Here we show that OPCs form contacts with their processes on neuronal somata in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. These contacts facilitate exocytosis of neuronal lysosomes. A reduction in the number or branching of OPCs reduces these contacts, which is associated with lysosome accumulation and altered metabolism in neurons and more senescent neurons with age. A similar reduction in OPC branching and neuronal lysosome accumulation is seen in an early-stage mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings have implications for the prevention of age-related pathologies and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",Nat Commun,2025
40186694,Whole Transcriptome RNA-Seq Reveals Drivers of Pathological Dysfunction in a Transgenic Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 55 million people worldwide, yet current theories cannot fully explain its aetiology. Accordingly, gene expression profiling has been used to provide a holistic view of the biology underpinning AD. Focusing primarily on protein-coding genes, such approaches have highlighted a critical involvement of microglia-related inflammatory processes. Simultaneous investigation of transcriptional regulators and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) can offer further insight into AD biology and inform the development of disease-modifying therapies. We previously described a method for whole transcriptome sampling to simultaneously investigate protein-coding genes and ncRNA. Here, we use this technique to explore transcriptional changes in a murine model of AD (15-month-old APP/PS1 mice). We confirmed the extensive involvement of microglia-associated genes and gene networks, consistent with literature. We also report a wealth of differentially-expressed non-coding RNA - including microRNA, long non-coding RNA, small nuclear and small nucleolar RNA, and pseudogenes - many of which have been overlooked previously. Transcription factor analysis determined that six transcription factors likely regulate gene expression changes in this model (Irf8, Junb, c-Fos, Lmo2, Runx1, and Nfe2l2). We then utilised validated miRNA-target interactions, finding 60 interactions between 15 miRNA and 42 mRNA (messenger RNA) with largely consistent directionality. Furthermore, we found that eight transcription factors (Clock, Lmo2, Runx1, Nfe2l2, Egr2, c-Fos, Junb, and Nr4a1) are likely responsible for the regulation of miRNA expression. Taken together, these data indicate a complex interplay of coding and non-coding RNA, driven by a small number of specific transcription factors, contributing to transcriptional changes in 15-month-old APP/PS1 mice.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39736697,Sex differences in the relationships between 24-h rest-activity patterns and plasma markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"BACKGROUND: Although separate lines of research indicated a moderating role of sex in both sleep-wake disruption and in the interindividual vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related processes, the quantification of sex differences in the interplay between sleep-wake dysregulation and AD pathology remains critically overlooked. Here, we examined sex-specific associations between circadian rest-activity patterns and AD-related pathophysiological processes across the adult lifespan.
METHODS: Ninety-two cognitively unimpaired adults (mean age = 59.85 ± 13.77 years, range = 30-85, 47 females) underwent 10 days of actigraphic recordings, and blood drawing. Standard non-parametric indices of 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability, IV) and stability (interdaily stability, IS) were extracted from actigraphy data using the GGIR package. Plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid-β<sub>42/40</sub> (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>), total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) or threonine 231 (p-tau<sub>231</sub>) were measured using Single molecule array technology. Multiple linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, education, body mass index, and actigraphic recording duration.
RESULTS: Higher IV, indicating worse 24-h rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, was associated with elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85) = 4.26, P &lt; 0.0001), GFAP (t(85) = 2.49, P = 0.01), and at trend level with lower Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio values (t(85) = -1.95, P = 0.054). Lower IS, reflecting less day-to-day stability in the 24-h rest-activity rhythm, was linked to elevated levels of plasma NfL (t(85) = -2.24, P = 0.03), but not with the other plasma biomarkers. Importantly, interaction models demonstrated that male participants were driving the observed relationships between IV and plasma NfL (t(84) = 4.05, P &lt; 0.001) or GFAP (t(84) = 3.60, P &lt; 0.001), but also revealed a male vulnerability in models testing interactions with p-tau<sub>181</sub> (IV: t(76) = 3.71, P &lt; 0.001; IS: t(76) = -3.30, P = 0.001) and p-tau<sub>231</sub> (IV: t(82) = 3.28, P = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses further showed that accounting for potential confounding factors such as APOE genotype, depression, and self-reported symptoms of possible sleep apnea did not modify the observed relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the association between disrupted circadian rest-activity patterns and AD pathophysiological processes may be more evident in cognitively unimpaired males. Our results contribute to the precision medicine approach, and they have clinical implications for improved early detection and selection of at-risk individuals to be enrolled in preventive interventions.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
40060041,Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Confers Neuroprotection and Restores Microglial Homeostasis in a Tauopathy Mouse Model.,"BACKGROUND: The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are derivatives of the arachidonic acid metabolism with anti-inflammatory activities. However, their efficacy is limited due to the rapid hydrolasis by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Accordingly, inhibition of sEH has been shown to stabilize the EETs and dampen neuroinflammation in Aβ mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of the sEH-EET signaling pathway in other cell types of the CNS and in other neurodegenerative conditions are less understood.
METHODS: Here we examined the mechanisms and the functional role of the sEH-EET axis in tauopathy by treating the PS19 mice with a small molecule sEH inhibitor TPPU and by crossing the PS19 mice with Ephx2 (gene encoding sEH) knockout mice, followed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), biochemical and immunohistochemical characterization, and behavioral analysis. We also tested the effect of the sEH-EET pathway in primary microglia cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons that develop seeding-induced Tau inclusions.
RESULTS: We show that sEH inhibition improved cognitive function, rescued neuronal cell loss, and reduced Tau pathology and microglia reactivity. snRNA-seq revealed that TPPU treatment resulted in the upregulation of actin cytoskeleton and excitatory synaptic pathway genes. Treating the human iPSC-derived neurons with TPPU led to enhanced synaptic density without affecting Tau accumulation, indicating a cell-autonomous effect of sEH blockade in neuroprotection. Further, sEH inhibition reversed disease-associated and interferon-response microglia states in PS19 mice and EET supplementation enhanced Tau phagocytosis and clearance in primary microglia cultures.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that sEH blockade or EET augmentation confer therapeutic benefit against neurodegenerative tauopathies through parallel targeting of neuronal and microglial pathways.",Res Sq,2025
39935616,CSF proteomics reveals changes in myelin and synaptic biology after Spectris treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain steady-state gamma oscillations evoked using a non-invasive medical device (Spectris) have shown potential clinical benefits in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), including reduced functional and cognitive decline, reduced brain volume and myelin loss, and increased brain functional connectivity. We analyzed changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins after Spectris treatment in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their relationship to established biological pathways implicated in AD.
METHODS: Unbiased proteomic analysis of CSF samples from participants with amyloid-positive MCI (n = 10) was conducted from the FLICKER (NCT03543878) clinical trial. Participants used the Cognito Therapeutics medical device (Spectris), confirmed to evoke steady-state gamma oscillations. Participants were instructed to use the device daily for 1 hour each day during the trial. CSF was collected prior to the start of stimulation and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The proteome was analyzed using tandem mass tag mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Differential expression analysis of proteins at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment (N = 5) revealed that 110 out of 2951 proteins met the significance threshold (analysis of variance, P &lt; 0.05, no false discovery rate). Sixty proteins were upregulated, and 50 proteins were downregulated after treatment. Changes in protein expression were mapped to the consensus human AD protein network, representing co-expressed and functionally linked modules linked to cell type and biochemical pathways. Treatment altered CSF proteins linked to AD-related brain proteome modules, including those involved in myelination (proteolipid protein 1, ecotropic viral integration site 2A), synaptic and neuroimmune functions, and regulation of cellular lipid transportation. Biological pathway analysis revealed that most impacted pathways were associated with lipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipids processing, and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.
DISCUSSION: The CSF proteomic changes observed in this study suggest pleiotropic effects on multiple pathways involved in AD, including myelination, synaptic and neuroimmune function, and lipid transport. These findings are also consistent with observations of white matter and myelin preservation after Spectris treatment of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We analyzed changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins in response to sensory-evoked gamma oscillations in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.Sensory evoked steady-state gamma oscillations were evoked by Spectris medical device.Changes in CSF proteins were observed after 8 weeks of daily 1 hour treatment.Affected proteins were related to myelination, synaptic and neuroimmune functions, and regulation of cellular lipid transportation.Proteomic changes support clinical outcomes and myelin preservation of Spectris treatment.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40107629,Vascular and glymphatic dysfunction as drivers of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from computational approaches.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by complex interactions between vascular dysfunction, glymphatic system impairment, and neuroinflammation. Vascular aging, characterized by arterial stiffness and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), disrupts the pulsatile forces necessary for glymphatic clearance, exacerbating amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation and cognitive decline. This review synthesizes insights into the mechanistic crosstalk between these systems and explores their contributions to AD pathogenesis. Emerging machine learning (ML) tools, such as DeepLabCut and Motion sequencing (MoSeq), offer innovative solutions for analyzing multimodal data and enhancing diagnostic precision. Integrating ML with imaging and behavioral analyses bridges gaps in understanding vascular-glymphatic dysfunction.

40033057,Long-read RNA sequencing atlas of human microglia isoforms elucidates disease-associated genetic regulation of splicing.,"Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, have been genetically implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Mapping the genetics of gene expression in human microglia has identified several loci associated with disease-associated genetic variants in microglia-specific regulatory elements. However, identifying genetic effects on splicing is challenging because of the use of short sequencing reads. Here, we present the isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas (isoMiGA), which leverages long-read RNA sequencing to identify 35,879 novel microglia isoforms. We show that these isoforms are involved in stimulation response and brain region specificity. We then quantified the expression of both known and novel isoforms in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 555 human microglia short-read RNA sequencing samples from 391 donors, and found associations with genetic risk loci in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We nominate several loci that may act through complex changes in isoform and splice-site usage.",Nat Genet,2025
39972387,Cornuside alleviates cognitive impairments induced by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> through attenuating NLRP3-mediated neurotoxicity by promoting mitophagy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation play crucial roles in its progression. Our previous studies found that cornuside from Cornus officinalis Sieb.Et Zucc is an anti-AD candidate, however, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, AD mice were established by intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and treated with cornuside (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Cornuside significantly ameliorated behavioral deficits, protected synaptic plasticity and relieved neuronal damage in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> induced mice. Importantly, cornuside decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, characterized by decreased levels of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, GSDMD, and IL-1β. Furthermore, cornuside promoted mitophagy accompanied by decreasing SQSTM1/p62 and promoting LC3B-I transforming into LC3B-II, via Pink1/Parkin signaling instead of FUNDC1 or BNIP3 pathways. In order to investigate the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome and mitophagy in the neuroprotective mechanism of cornuside, we established an in-vitro model in BV2 cells exposed to LPS and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. And cornuside inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent cytokine release, also protected neurons from damaging factors in microenvironment of conditional culture. Cornuside improved mitochondrial function by promoting oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, decreasing the production of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. Besides, mitophagy was also facilitated with increased colocalization of MitoTracker with LC3B and Parkin, and Pink1/Parkin, FUNDC1 and BNIP3 pathways were all involved in the mechanism of cornuside. By blocking the formation of autophagosomes by 3-MA, the protective effects on mitochondria, the inhibition on NLRP3 inflammasome as well as neuronal protection in conditional culture were eliminated. There is reason to believe that the promotion of mitophagy plays a key role in the NLRP3 inhibition of cornuside. In conclusion, cornuside re-establishes the mitophagy flux which eliminates damaged mitochondria and recovers mitochondrial function, both of them are in favor of inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, then alleviating neuronal and synaptic damage, and finally improving cognitive function.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40193789,"Hypertension and Diabetes as Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease-related Mortality, a Retrospective Epidemiological Study (P11-3.018).","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess mortality trends associated with hypertension and diabetes-associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) across various demographics in the United States.
BACKGROUND: Hypertension and diabetes have been linked to elevated Alzheimer's disease mortality in US adults aged 65+ over the last decade, necessitating additional research.
DESIGN/METHODS: Death certificates from the CDC Wonder database (1999-2020) were analyzed for multiple causes of death, including Alzheimer's disease (MCD-ICD 10 Codes: G30.0, G30.1, G30.8, G30.9), hypertension (I10-I15), and diabetes mellitus (E10-E14). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 persons and annual percent change (APC) were calculated and categorized by gender, race/ethnicity, census region, and urbanization.
RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2020, there were 518,697 deaths related to Hypertension and diabetes-linked Alzheimer's disease among individuals aged 65 and above. The age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) rose from 26.95 in 1999 to 56.77 in 2005 (APC: 10.41, 95% CI: 7.06 to 16.09), slightly increased to 57.01 in 2015 (APC: -0.80, 95% CI: -4.42 to 0.49), and then sharp increase to 82.25 in 2020 (APC: 7.01, 95% CI: 3.83 to 14.39). Females consistently had higher AAMRs than males, from 28.02 vs. 24.00 in 1999 to 90.48 vs. 68.67 in 2020. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black or African American individuals had the highest overall AAMR (94.82), followed by Hispanic or Latino (88.85), NH White (82.75), NH Asian or Pacific Islander (54.02), and NH American Indian or Alaska Native (51.47). Non-metropolitan areas had a higher AAMR (97.95) compared to metropolitan areas (79.06). Regionally, the Western U.S. had the highest AAMR (93.92), followed by the Midwest (90.06), South (88.13), and Northeast (48.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension and diabetes-associated Alzheimer's disease mortality rates consistently rose from 1999-2005, fluctuated until 2015, and increased again from 2015 to 2020. Non-Hispanic Black or African American, female, non-metropolitan, and West region populations exhibited higher mortality rates. Targeted research and prevention strategies are necessary.

40042447,Polygenic score integrating neurodegenerative and vascular risk informs dementia risk stratification.,"INTRODUCTION: An integrative polygenic risk score (iPRS) capturing the neurodegenerative and vascular contribution to dementia could identify high-risk individuals and improve risk prediction.
METHODS: We developed an iPRS for dementia (iPRS-DEM) in Europeans (aged 65+), comprising genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 23 vascular or neurodegenerative traits (excluding apolipoprotein E [APOE]). iPRS-DEM was evaluated across cohorts comprising older community-dwelling people (N = 3702), a multi-ancestry biobank (N = 130,797 Europeans; 105,404 non-Europeans), and dementia-free memory clinic participants (N = 2032).
RESULTS: iPRS-DEM was associated with dementia risk independently of APOE in the elderly (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR]<sub>per1SD </sub>= 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 1.28), which generalized to Europeans (EUR-sHR<sub>per1SD </sub>= 1.28, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.51]), East-Asians (EAS-sHR<sub>per1SD </sub>= 5.29, 95% CI: 1.43 to 34.36), and memory-clinic participants (sHR<sub>per1SD </sub>= 1.25, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.42). Prediction was comparable to clinical risk factors in older community-dwelling people, with improved performance among memory-clinic patients. Risk stratification was enhanced by defining four genetic risk groups with iPRS-DEM and APOE ε4, reaching five-fold increased risk in APOE ε4+/iPRS-DEM+ memory-clinic participants.
DISCUSSION: Alongside APOE ε4, iPRS-DEM may refine risk stratification for the enrichment of dementia clinical trials and prevention programs.
HIGHLIGHTS: iPRS-DEM reflects neurodegenerative and vascular contribution to dementia. We show iPRS-DEM captures additional dementia genetic risk beyond APOE and AD-PRS. iPRS-DEM, in combination with APOE ε4, shows promise for dementia risk stratification. Our results generalize across both population-based and memory-clinic settings. We show transportability of iPRS-DEM to East Asian ancestry.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40040240,Adapting the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised with Semantic Cues: Assessing diagnostic utility in a Spanish clinical population.,"Background: The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) is widely used for assessing episodic memory. In this study, we evaluated the HVLT-R with Semantic Cues (HVLT-R-SC), an adapted version incorporating semantic cues to improve diagnostic utility. The assessment was conducted in a Spanish cohort comprising cognitively unimpaired controls, individuals with multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (md-aMCI), and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: 684 participants (333 controls, 141 md-aMCI, and 210 early AD) completed the HVLT-R-SC. Effect sizes were calculated to quantify group differences, while Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the test's reliability. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess discriminatory power, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizing classification accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, and efficacy percentages were reported, with optimized cutoff points determined. Odds ratios quantified the association between HVLT-R-SC performance and diagnostic group classifications. Results: Significant differences were observed across all HVLT-R-SC indices among the groups. Total Delayed Recall with and without Semantic Cues exhibited the largest effect size (η<sup>2</sup> = 0.69), with Total Delayed Recall with Semantic Cues demonstrating the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.90 for differentiating md-aMCI from controls and 0.99 for distinguishing early AD from controls). Optimal cutoffs for Total Delayed Recall with Semantic Cues were 5 words for md-aMCI (sensitivity = 74%, specificity = 90%, efficacy = 85.44%) and 4 words for early AD (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 97%, efficacy = 95.21%). Significant associations were observed between HVLT-R-SC performance and diagnostic classification, with an odds ratio of 26.04 for md-aMCI and 362.50 for early AD. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95), indicating strong reliability of the HVLT-R-SC. Conclusions: The HVLT-R-SC demonstrated strong reliability and excellent diagnostic performance in identifying memory impairments. The inclusion of semantic cues improved diagnostic accuracy, provided clinically actionable cutoff points, and enhanced the test's utility, particularly for detecting md-aMCI and early AD.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
40046335,Plasma biomarkers for diagnosis and differentiation and their cognitive correlations in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Increasing evidence has shown the potential value of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic and differential values of emerging plasma biomarkers for different types of dementia in a Chinese population and to explore their cognitive correlations. One hundred twenty patients with dementia, including 51 Alzheimer's disease patients, 54 subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia (SIVD) patients and 15 frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients were recruited alongside 27 cognitively unimpaired (CU) control subjects. Global and domain-specific cognition was assessed in all participants by a battery of neuropsychological tests. Plasma amyloid-beta (Αβ)42, Aβ40 and total tau (in CU controls and Alzheimer's disease patients) and phosphorylated tau at threonine-181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL) and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) levels (in all participants) were measured using the single-molecule array platform. The levels of all biomarkers differed between Alzheimer's disease patients and CU controls, with P-tau181 and GFAP levels and the Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio best differentiating the two groups [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.966, 0.932 and 0.927, respectively]. P-tau181 and GFAP levels were greater in the Alzheimer's disease group than in the other two patient groups and showed the best performance in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease patients from SIVD (AUC = 0.922) and FTLD patients (AUC = 0.894), respectively. Moreover, compared with that in the CU group, the GFAP level was elevated in the SIVD group, and the NfL level was elevated in all patient groups. Compared with other single biomarkers, the plasma Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio correlated with broader cognitive domains, including global cognition [Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), r = 0.314, P = 0.027; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), r = 0.313, P = 0.043], memory (r = 0.339, P = 0.016), language (r = 0.333, P = 0.020), attention and information processing speed (r = 0.369, P = 0.008), executive function (r = 0.305, P = 0.031) and visuospatial function memory (r = 0.453, P = 0.001). P-tau181 was an optimal plasma biomarker for identifying Alzheimer's disease patients and differentiating Alzheimer's disease patients from SIVD and FTLD patients. Moreover, the GFAP level and the Aβ42/P-tau181 ratio showed potential diagnostic and progression monitoring value, respectively, for Alzheimer's disease patients.",Brain Commun,2025
40170393,Alzheimer's disease blood-based biomarker testing: A stakeholder-informed assessment of coverage considerations.,"BackgroundRecently published clinical studies suggest that blood-based biomarker tests (BBMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) provide value, but in the U.S., neither public nor private payers currently cover these tests.ObjectiveTo describe considerations for payer coverage of AD BBMTs that would need to be addressed to facilitate timely diagnosis and equitable patient access if clinical utility is demonstrated.MethodsWe performed a targeted literature review to characterize predictable coverage barriers for BBMTs and inform the development of an interview guide. We conducted semi-structured interviews with clinicians, researchers, test developers, and a patient advocate and former payer (N = 12) to assess the barriers and refine the proposed key considerations for obtaining payer coverage.ResultsStakeholders noted that payers will require evidence of clinical validity and utility of BBMTs as part of their coverage determinations contingent on the specific indication for testing, with insufficient evidence for screening applications currently. Stakeholders also agreed that there are evidence gaps for use of BBMTs in patients from ethnic and racial minority communities that must be addressed. Given the shortage of memory specialists, stakeholders noted that limiting testing coverage authorization to specialists could be harmful to patients, particularly the underserved. Interviewees also agreed that patients with mild cognitive impairment or early-stage AD could benefit from earlier diagnosis to avoid progressing to moderate disease and limiting eligibility for new disease-modifying therapies.ConclusionsIf BBMTs meet criteria for clinical utility, anticipating and planning for coverage and reimbursement before widespread implementation will be critical to ensuring broad, equitable access to BBMTs.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40116671,Validate association of gene loci and establish genetic risk prediction models for late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese populations.,"BackgroundMore than 60 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk by genome-wide association studies in European.ObjectiveWe aimed to confirm these SNPs in Chinese Han populations and investigate the utility of these genetic markers.MethodsAltogether 1595 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients and 2474 controls from Chinese population were recruited. We replicated the association of 68 SNPs with LOAD and established polygenetic risk score (PRS) prediction model using significant SNPs. Meta-analysis for MS4A6A rs610932 and PICALM rs3851179 were performed.ResultsAccording to our findings, 14 out of 68 SNPs are validated significantly associated with LOAD (adjusted p &lt; 0.05) after adjusting age and sex in the Chinese population. Besides, after stratification by APOE ε4 status, almost all SNPs retain markedly relationship with LOAD in APOE ε4 noncarriers. However, few loci retain correlation in APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve prediction model for distinguishing LOAD patients from normal subjects were 0.614 for PRS and 0.689 for PRS and APOE. In addition, meta-analysis including this study of East Asian populations confirmed that rs610932 and rs3851179 were dramatically related to the LOAD (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.97; OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.83-0.91).ConclusionsDespite genetic heterogeneity, there are still common loci among different races. PRS based on AD risk-associated SNPs may supplement APOE for better assessing individual risk for AD in Chinese. Besides, interactions between genes and gene environment affect the impact of risk allele on diverse populations.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39711228,Differences in baseline cognitive performance between participants with early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: Comparison of LEADS and ADNI.,"INTRODUCTION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) share similar amyloid etiology, but evidence from smaller-scale studies suggests that they manifest differently clinically. Current analyses sought to contrast the cognitive profiles of EOAD and LOAD.
METHODS: Z-score cognitive-domain composites for 311 amyloid-positive sporadic EOAD and 314 amyloid-positive LOAD participants were calculated from baseline data from age-appropriate control cohorts. Z-score composites were compared between AD groups for each domain.
RESULTS: After controlling for cognitive status, EOAD displayed worse visuospatial, executive functioning, and processing speed/attention skills relative to LOAD, and LOAD displayed worse language, episodic immediate memory, and episodic delayed memory.
DISCUSSION: Sporadic EOAD possesses distinct cognitive profiles relative to LOAD. Clinicians should be alert for non-amnestic impairments in younger patients to ensure proper identification and intervention using disease-modifying treatments.
HIGHLIGHTS: Both early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) participants displayed widespread cognitive impairments relative to their same-aged peers. Cognitive impairments were more severe for EOAD than for LOAD participants in visuospatial and executive domains. Memory and language impairments were more severe for LOAD than for EOAD participants Results were comparable after removing clinical phenotypes of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), primary progressive aphasia (lv-PPA), and frontal-variant AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

40193790,Identifying an Optimal Cut-off Value and if Sex Differences Exist in Nigrostriatal Dopamine Transporter Binding of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT in Autopsy Confirmed Lewy Body Disease and/or Alzheimer's Disease (P10-3.002).,"OBJECTIVE: To assess <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT SPECT (DaT-SPECT) in autopsy confirmed Lewy body disease (LBD) and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and to identify if sex differences exist.
BACKGROUND: Identifying optimal cut-off value for DaT-SPECT in detecting LBD is essential in LBD clinical trials and research. Effects of sex in nigrostriatal dopamine transporter (DaT) binding of the DaT-SPECT in autopsy confirmed LBD is not well known.
DESIGN/METHODS: Autopsy confirmed neocortical or limbic LBD and/or AD patients who underwent DaT-SPECT were included. Nigrostriatal DaT binding and z-scores were assessed using DaTQUANT2.0 software (GE Healthcare).
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients had LBD pathology [19 without AD (L+/A-) and 14 with AD (L+/A+); 30 neocortical and 3 limbic LBD; 26 male and 7 female] and 12 had AD pathology without LBD (L-/A+). A cut-off value of -0.98 for the DaTQUANT putamen z-score yielded 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity in detecting LBD. Age at death, age at DaT-SPECT, MMSE, UPDRS part III, and DaTQUANT z-score of putamen (-3.55±0.97 vs -2.94±1.71) or caudate (-2.77±1.18 vs -2.46±1.48) did not differ between the L+/A- and L+/A+. Males were more frequent in L+/A- (95%) than in L+/A (57%). Age at death, age at DaT-SPECT, interval between DaT-SPECT and death, and MMSE did not differ between the L+ males and females. The L+ females had more frequent AD co-pathology (86% vs 31%), more AD dementia clinical diagnosis (29% vs 0%), lower UPDRS part-III (11.4±12.3 vs 23.2±13.0), and higher DaTQUANT putamen (-2.17±1.98 vs -3.60±0.97) and caudate (-1.65±1.64 vs -2.90±1.08) z-scores. All L+ females had neocortical LBD, and the two L+ females with AD clinical diagnosis had normal DaT-SPECT and L+/A+ pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: DaTQUANT using cut-off putamen z-score value of -1 showed excellent discriminatory power in detecting LBD pathology. Though limited by relatively few females, there were potential sex differences observed in DaT-SPECT as well as in clinical and pathological findings.

40052962,"Discussing the interplay of social determinants of health, aging and Alzheimer's biomarkers in U.S. Latinos.","This perspective examines the impact of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) on biological age-related decline and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) biomarker trajectories in U.S. Latino populations, emphasizing the need for comprehensive multilevel research frameworks tailored to the community. We discuss the prevailing SDoH among U.S. Latino communities, including economic, educational, and healthcare access inequities that heighten health risks. Subsequently, we examine the pronounced differences in ADRD prevalence and biomarker trajectories among Latinos, suggesting that the interplay between SDoH and biological markers contributes to ADRD risk and progression. Our perspective reflects on the existing research landscape, noting a substantial gap in studies extending beyond identifying and understanding disparities in ADRD, to research incorporating biomarkers and developing actionable interventions to address broader SDoH. This shift is essential for creating a more holistic approach to ADRD research and devising truly effective strategies to mitigate ADRD disparities and improve brain health for older U.S. Latinos.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,2025
40194018,Predicting Cognitive Decline Using Baseline Data in Cognitively Unimpaired Older Adults: Results from the A4 Trial (P2-3.018).,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting cognitive/functional decline on the CDR over a 5-year period in cognitively unimpaired older adults.
BACKGROUND: The clinical and biological heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer's disease makes the design of trials and inclusion of appropriate participants difficult. Identifying methods to discern more homogenous subgroups of participants can assist in enriching trials.
DESIGN/METHODS: Participants included 1169 amyloid-positive participants enrolled in the A4 trial (receiving solanezumab, N=578, or placebo, N=591), and 538 amyloid-negative individuals enrolled in the LEARN observational study. We used multiple logistic regression models to examine the separate and joint predictive value of demographics, APOE4 genotype, neuropsychological tests, amyloid PET SUVR, and plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (P-tau217) levels in predicting individuals experiencing cognitive/functional decline (defined as an increase of 0.5 or more in the CDR-global score after 240 weeks).
RESULTS: Participants had an average age of 70.5 ± 4.2 years, with 60.3% being female. The addition of P-tau217 and PACC to the base model (demographics and APOE4 status) significantly improved the predictive performance across all study arms. For the base model plus P-tau217, the AUC values were: Solanezumab (AUC = 0.81±0.11), Placebo (AUC = 0.78±0.11), and LEARN (AUC = 0.76±0.15). Similarly, for the base model plus PACC, the AUC values were: Solanezumab (AUC = 0.72±0.12), Placebo (AUC = 0.76±0.11), and LEARN (AUC = 0.74±0.15). The models that included all covariates achieved the highest predictive performance across the study arms, with AUC values of: Solanezumab (AUC = 0.82 ± 0.1), Placebo (AUC = 0.83 ± 0.1), and LEARN (AUC = 0.80 ± 0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of baseline neuropsychological scores and plasma P-tau217 in predicting cognitive decline. Predictive models using these practical measures can improve clinical trial design and optimize participant selection, enhancing the effectiveness of interventions.

40026013,Validation of the Cognitive-Emotional Perspective Taking test in patients with neurodegeneration.,"BackgroundTheory of mind (ToM) is crucial for socioemotional interaction. ToM deficits may explain behavioral changes in dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).ObjectiveThis study examined the psychometrics of a new ToM test in healthy adults, identified ToM differences in dementia syndromes, and assessed if ToM scores predict neuropsychiatric function and real-life behavior.MethodsThe UCSF Cognitive and Emotional Perspective Taking Test (CEPT) was evaluated in 195 healthy adults (age: 42.69 ± 16.20) and in a clinic cohort of 304 participants (age: 64.07 ± 9.2). Participants included healthy controls, AD, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), non-fluent PPA (nfvPPA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. CEPT's psychometrics were assessed, and ToM differences and predictions of neuropsychiatric symptoms were analyzed using regression models.ResultsIn controls, CEPT showed good validity and reliability. In patients, CEPT scores correlated with executive and emotional measures, but not language measures, showing good construct validity. Cognitive ToM was most impaired in AD and bvFTD, with less impairment in svPPA and PSP, and all patient groups showed impaired emotional ToM. ToM performance predicted real-life neuropsychiatric behavior, including anxiety, apathy, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behaviors.ConclusionsToM deficits appear early in dementia syndromes and predict neuropsychiatric behavior. Assessing ToM and social cognition with ecologically valid tasks may help identify altered social cognition in early neurodegeneration.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39953864,Inspiring Undergraduate Student Training in Alzheimer's Research (USTAR): Training the Next Generation of Aging Scientists.,"Inspiring Undergraduate Student Training in Alzheimer's Research (USTAR) aims to provide Underrepresented Minority (URM) undergraduate students with mentored didactic, clinical, and research experiences to stimulate interest in research related to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). USTAR specifically focuses on social determinants of health (SDOH) as risk factors for ADRD minoritized populations. USTAR's scientific rationale is that URM undergraduates are less likely to enter the biomedical workforce. Addressing this disparity is important since minorities are disproportionally affected by ADRD, and URM scientists may deeply appreciate the sociocultural forces that create racial health disparities. USTAR unites faculty expertise from Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and Delaware State University (DSU), a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The faculty's work spans the full spectrum of ADRD research and care, including neuroscience, biology, gerontology, geriatrics, neurology, and geriatric psychiatry. The 20-month USTAR program will train two cohorts of 10 students. Across all USTAR activities, we emphasize the relationship between SDOH and cognition. USTAR's goals are to: (1) provide interdisciplinary ADRD-related research, educational, clinical, and community experiences; (2) enhance research skills via group research projects; (3) facilitate transition from undergraduate to graduate studies in science; and (4) evaluate USTAR's effectiveness.

39962113,Dense convolution-based attention network for Alzheimer's disease classification.,"Recently, deep learning-based medical image classification models have made substantial advancements. However, many existing models prioritize performance at the cost of efficiency, limiting their practicality in clinical use. Traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods, Transformer-based methods, and hybrid approaches combining these two struggle to balance performance and model complexity. To achieve efficient predictions with a low parameter count, we propose DenseAttentionNetwork (DANet), a lightweight model for Alzheimer's disease detection in 3D MRI images. DANet leverages dense connections and a linear attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction and capture long-range dependencies. Its architecture integrates convolutional layers for localized feature extraction with linear attention for global context, enabling efficient multi-scale feature reuse across the network. By replacing traditional self-attention with a parameter-efficient linear attention mechanism, DANet overcomes some limitations of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments across multi-institutional datasets demonstrate that DANet achieves the best performance in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which underscores the model's robustness and effectiveness in capturing relevant features for Alzheimer's disease detection while also attaining a strong accuracy structure with fewer parameters. Visualizations based on activation maps further verify the model's ability to highlight AD-relevant regions in 3D MRI images, providing clinically interpretable insights into disease progression.",Sci Rep,2025
39857716,"Dysregulation of Metabolic Peptides in the Gut-Brain Axis Promotes Hyperinsulinemia, Obesity, and Neurodegeneration.","Metabolic peptides can influence metabolic processes and contribute to both inflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that there are thousands of metabolic peptides, made up of short chains of amino acids, that the human body produces. These peptides are crucial for regulating many different processes like metabolism and cell signaling, as they bind to receptors on various cells. This review will cover the role of three specific metabolic peptides and their roles in hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, inflammation, and neurodegeneration, as well as their roles in type 3 diabetes and dementia. The metabolic peptides glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitor polypeptide (GIP), and pancreatic peptide (PP) will be discussed, as dysregulation within their processes can lead to the development of various inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Research has been able to closely investigate the connections between these metabolic peptides and their links to the gut-brain axis, highlighting changes made in the gut that can lead to dysfunction in processes in the brain, as well as changes made in the brain that can lead to dysregulation in the gut. The role of metabolic peptides in the development and potentially reversal of diseases such as obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and type 2 diabetes will also be discussed. Furthermore, we review the potential links between these conditions and neuroinflammation and the development of neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, specifically Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",Biomedicines,2025
39871348,"Lipidome disruption in Alzheimer's disease brain: detection, pathological mechanisms, and therapeutic implications.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most devastating neurodegenerative disorders with limited treatment options. Emerging evidence points to the involvement of lipid dysregulation in the development of AD. Nevertheless, the precise lipidomic landscape and the mechanistic roles of lipids in disease pathology remain poorly understood. This review aims to highlight the significance of lipidomics and lipid-targeting approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. We summarized the connection between lipid dysregulation in the human brain and AD at both genetic and lipid species levels. We briefly introduced lipidomics technologies and discussed potential challenges and areas of future advancements in the lipidomics field for AD research. To elucidate the central role of lipids in converging multiple pathological aspects of AD, we reviewed the current knowledge on the interplay between lipids and major AD features, including amyloid beta, tau, and neuroinflammation. Finally, we assessed the progresses and obstacles in lipid-based therapeutics and proposed potential strategies for leveraging lipidomics in the treatment of AD.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39691161,"Neuroimaging techniques, gene therapy, and gut microbiota: frontier advances and integrated applications in Alzheimer's Disease research.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline, for which effective treatments remain elusive due to complex pathogenesis. Recent advances in neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research offer new insights and potential intervention strategies. Neuroimaging enables early detection and staging of AD through visualization of biomarkers, aiding diagnosis and tracking of disease progression. Gene therapy presents a promising approach for modifying AD-related genetic expressions, targeting amyloid and tau pathology, and potentially repairing neuronal damage. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences AD pathology through the gut-brain axis, impacting inflammation, immune response, and amyloid metabolism. However, each of these technologies faces significant challenges, including concerns about safety, efficacy, and ethical considerations. This article reviews the applications, advantages, and limitations of neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research in AD, with a particular focus on their combined potential for early diagnosis, mechanistic insights, and therapeutic interventions. We propose an integrated approach that leverages these tools to provide a multi-dimensional framework for advancing AD diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40002697,Non-Invasive Retinal Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain associated with ageing and is the most prevalent form of dementia, affecting an estimated 55 million people worldwide, with projections suggesting this number will exceed 150 million by 2050. With its increasing prevalence, AD represents a significant global health challenge with potentially serious social and economic consequences. Diagnosing AD is particularly challenging as it requires timely recognition. Currently, there is no effective therapy for AD; however, certain medications may help slow its progression. Existing diagnostic methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and biomarker analysis in cerebrospinal fluid tend to be expensive and invasive, making them impractical for widespread use. Consequently, research into non-invasive biomarkers that enable early detection and screening for AD is a crucial area of contemporary clinical investigation. One promising approach for the early diagnosis of AD may be retinal imaging. As an extension of the central nervous system, the retina offers a distinctive opportunity for non-invasive brain structure and function assessment. Considering their shared embryological origins and the vascular and immunological similarities between the eye and brain, alterations in the retina may indicate pathological changes in the brain, including those specifically related to AD. Studies suggest that structural and vascular changes in the retina, particularly within the neuronal network and blood vessels, may act as markers of cerebral changes caused by AD. These retinal alterations have the potential to act as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Since AD is typically diagnosed only after a significant neuronal loss has occurred, identifying early diagnostic markers could enable timely intervention and help prevent disease progression. Non-invasive retinal imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, provide accessible methods for the early detection of changes linked to AD. This review article focuses on the potential of retinal imaging as a non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. Investigating the ageing of the retina and its connections to neurodegenerative processes could significantly enhance the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of AD, paving the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",Biomedicines,2025
40145251,Motor symptoms in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease increase the risk of progression to severe cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor symptoms may present throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) course. We evaluated the impact of motor symptoms on the risk of progression to severe cognitive impairment, severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), and mortality in patients with autopsy-confirmed AD. We also examined the rates of non-AD pathology and identified the predictors of disease progression among these patients.
METHODS: Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) were used for this analysis. Participants (N = 1167) were required to have autopsy-confirmed AD.
RESULTS: Motor symptoms were predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment but not progression to severe NPSs or death. Presenting with gait disturbance and slowness but not falls or tremor was predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with motor symptoms had higher rates of Lewy body disease pathology on autopsy.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the presence of motor symptoms in autopsy-confirmed AD, particularly gait disturbance and slowness, are predictive of more rapid cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Clinician-defined motor symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) predicted more rapid progression to severe cognitive impairment but not to severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) or death. Among AD patients with motor symptoms, presenting with gait disturbance and slowness was predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment, whereas presenting with falls and tremor was not predictive of progression to severe cognitive impairment. Patients with motor symptoms, particularly gait disturbance and slowness, had higher rates of comorbid Lewy body disease pathology.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39935410,"White matter injury, plasma Alzheimer's disease, and neurodegenerative biomarkers on cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults: A 10-year longitudinal study.","INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the synergistic impact of white matter injury, Alzheimer's disease, and neurodegenerative pathology on long-term cognitive decline and dementia risk in older adults.
METHODS: We included 262 dementia-free participants with baseline and follow-up interviews (2010-2021). At baseline, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) was assessed from diffusion tensor imaging. Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured using a single-molecule immune-array assay. Cognitive function was evaluated using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and domain-specific cognitive tests.
RESULTS: Participants with high-level PSMD, p-tau217, and NfL showed the fastest decline of MMSE (β = -0.30) and the highest dementia incidence of 3.54/100 person-years. A combination model with three markers demonstrated a good predictive value for dementia, incorporating age, sex, education, and apolipoprotein E (area under the curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval = 0.86, 0.99).
DISCUSSION: Combining co-pathology markers may identify individuals with a high risk of cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) was correlated with long-term cognitive decline, and this correlation was modified by plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Participants with high levels of PSMD, p-tau217, and NfL showed the fastest cognitive decline and the highest risk of dementia. A combination of the three markers exhibited a good predictive value of incident dementia over a 10-year follow-up period.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40011801,Combining single-cell ATAC and RNA sequencing for supervised cell annotation.,"MOTIVATION: Single-cell analysis offers insights into cellular heterogeneity and individual cell function. Cell type annotation is the first and critical step for performing such an analysis. Current methods mostly utilize single-cell RNA sequencing data. Several studies demonstrated improved unsupervised annotation when combining RNA with single-cell ATAC sequencing, but improvements in supervised methods have not been explored.
RESULTS: Single-cell 10x genomics multiome datasets containing paired ATAC and RNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neuronal cells with Alzheimer's Disease were used for supervised annotation. Using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods and random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression classification models, we demonstrate the improvement in supervised annotation and prediction confidence in PBMC data when using a combination of RNA seq and ATAC-seq data. No such improvement was observed when annotating neuronal cells. Specifically, F1 scores were improved when using scVI embeddings to annotate PBMC sub-types. CD4 T effector memory cells showed the largest improvement in F1 score.",BMC Bioinformatics,2025
40189781,Association of genetic risk score for Alzheimer's disease with late-life body mass index in all of us: Evaluating reverse causation.,"INTRODUCTION: Decreases in body mass index (BMI) may be early consequences of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiological changes. Previous research in the UK Biobank estimated that AD-related genes began affecting BMI around age 47. We assessed whether this result could be replicated using longitudinal data in an independent cohort.
METHODS: Using All of Us (AOU) (N = 197,619, aged 30+) data, we estimated linear mixed models for associations of Z-scored AD-Genetic Risk Score (AD-GRS) with BMI, stratified by decade of age. We calculated the earliest age at which AD-GRS was associated with differences in BMI using cross-validated models adjusted for demographics.
RESULTS: Higher AD-GRS was statistically associated with lower BMI in participants aged 60-70 (b = -0.060 [-0.113, -0.007]). Best fitting models suggested the inverse association of AD-GRS and BMI emerged beginning at ages 47-54.
DISCUSSION: AD genes accelerate age-related weight loss starting in middle age.
HIGHLIGHTS: Understanding when physiological changes from amyloid pathology begin is key for AD prevention. Our findings indicate that AD-associated genes accelerate midlife weight loss, starting between 47 and 54 years. AD prevention research should consider that disease pathology likely begins by middle age.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40040908,A comparative study of methods for dynamic survival analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Dynamic survival analysis has become an effective approach for predicting time-to-event outcomes based on longitudinal data in neurology, cognitive health, and other health-related domains. With advancements in machine learning, several new methods have been introduced, often using a two-stage approach: first extracting features from longitudinal trajectories and then using these to predict survival probabilities.
METHODS: This work compares several combinations of longitudinal and survival models, assessing their predictive performance across different training strategies. Using synthetic and real-world cognitive health data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we explore the strengths and limitations of each model.
RESULTS: Among the considered survival models, the Random Survival Forest consistently delivered strong results across different datasets, longitudinal models, and training strategies. On the ADNI dataset the best performing method was Random Survival Forest with the last visit benchmark and super landmarking with an average tdAUC of 0.96 and brier score of 0.07. Several other methods, including Cox Proportional Hazards and the Recurrent Neural Network, achieve similar scores. While the tested longitudinal models often struggled to outperform simple benchmarks, neural network models showed some improvement in simulated scenarios with sufficiently informative longitudinal trajectories.
DISCUSSION: Our findings underscore the importance of aligning model selection and training strategies with the specific characteristics of the data and the target application, providing valuable insights that can inform future developments in dynamic survival analysis.",Front Neurol,2025
40174910,Pathological Characterisation of Posterior Cortical Atrophy in Comparison With Amnestic Alzheimer's Disease.,"AIMS: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a predominantly young-onset neurodegenerative syndrome, typically caused by Alzheimer's disease (PCA-AD). PCA-AD presents with visual and spatial dysfunction attributed to occipito-parietal or 'posterior' brain regions rather than memory difficulties characteristic of typical amnestic-led Alzheimer's disease (a-AD) attributed to medial temporal regions. Imaging and neuropathological studies suggest that PCA-AD is associated with a more posterior distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), whereas β-amyloid pathology (Aβ) is diffusely deposited throughout the cortex. This study characterised the neuropathological substrates of PCA-AD in comparison with a-AD, to further understanding of the biological basis of phenotypical heterogeneity in AD.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for Aβ; tau; the microglial markers CD68, CR3-43 and Iba1; α-synuclein; and TDP-43 was carried out on 26 PCA-AD and 27 age and gender-matched a-AD cases at the Queen Square Brain Bank. Aβ, tau and the three microglial markers were quantified in the superior frontal, superior temporal, superior parietal and occipital (primary visual cortex) cortices, with α-synuclein and TDP-43 assessed using formal staging criteria. In addition, microglial circularity, a morphological indicator of microglial activation state, was calculated.
RESULTS: There was a higher load of Aβ and tau in the parietal region of PCA-AD compared to a-AD. In the PCA-AD compared to the a-AD group, there were significant increases in tau load in parietal and frontal relative to temporal regions. There was no difference in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) severity between PCA-AD and a-AD. There was a significantly lower temporal CD68 load in a-AD compared with PCA-AD. In a-AD, CD68 load was lowest and tau load highest in the temporal relative to all other regions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates differences in the distribution of Aβ and tau and variations in regional neuroinflammatory response in PCA-AD and a-AD. These findings extend our understanding of the biological substrates underpinning PCA-AD and highlight the potential for exploring phenotypic variants to understand selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,2025
40193785,Development of a Tool for Community Deployment That Detects ALS and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases (P8-2.005).,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases that can be self administered.
BACKGROUND: Better identification of at-risk individuals and care access for racial and ethnic minorities is needed for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NDDs) including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS), Alzheimer's Disease(AD) and Parkinson's Disease(PD). There are currently no widely accepted, effective, rapid, and easily-administered screening tools that can be deployed into the community and enable early disease detection when treatments may be most effective.
DESIGN/METHODS: The Neurodegenerative Disease Assessment (NDA) Tool was designed as a short electronic survey with three sets of 4-6 questions regarding possible symptoms for each of the three NDDs (ALS, AD, or PD). This survey was self-administered followed by administration by health care professionals at community settings and health clinics. For those participants answering positively in any of the three sections, a focused physical examination was performed and if suggestive of disease, the participant was referred for a complete neurologic evaluation.
RESULTS: 35 participants (aged 18-85) completed the self and professional-administered NDA tool. 69% had identical results between administrations. The difference between administrations was not statistically significant among all participants (t= -1.9272, p = 0.06234) and among the subset with non-identical results (t=-2.0066 p = 0.06097). Mismatches were related to shaking and gait(PD,55%), daily tasks and unusual behaviors(AD,55%), and weakness and pseudobulbar affect(ALS,31%). False positivity was highest (89%) with self-administration of AD questions. Physical exam positivity was 31.7% more likely in participants with identical results.
CONCLUSIONS: The NDA tool produces similar results with user and healthcare professional administration and holds promise for self-administration. Further research is necessary to optimize the survey questions to avoid false positive screening. We will then be able to determine which positive responses are most predictive of actual disease, enabling the development of a weighted score that can be used for appropriate referral to specialty care.

39732514,Cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories of subjective cognitive decline according to baseline biomarkers: Results of the CoSCo study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now diagnosed biologically. Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may indicate preclinical AD, assessing AD-biomarkers is crucial. We investigated cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories in SCD over 24 months based on biomarker positivity, and evaluated the predictive value of plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: The CoSCo prospective cohort included older adults with SCD. Participants were categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ] 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to compare outcomes.
RESULTS: High-risk SCDs (n = 23, 23%) revealed greater decline in general cognition, memory recall, frontal function, and hippocampal volumes compared to low-risk SCDs. Combined scores of plasma and MRIs yielded the best predictions compared with other biomarker categories.
DISCUSSION: SCD participants with high-risk experience faster cognitive and neurodegenerative declines. A combination of plasma biomarkers and MRIs could be used for screening and prognosis.
HIGHLIGHTS: This is part of a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea. We investigated cognitive and atrophic trajectories in SCD over 24 months. High risk SCDs revealed greater cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. Integration of plasma and MRIs yielded better predictions than other categories. Risk stratification using plasma and MRIs can be used for screening and prognosis.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40145397,Intraneuronal Aβ accumulation causes tau hyperphosphorylation via endolysosomal leakage.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau. Many attempts have been made to clarify the link between Aβ and tau in the pathogenesis, but conclusive data describing a pathway for this connection are still lacking.
METHODS: We developed a neuronal model of Aβ-induced toxicity and studied downstream effects of intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation on tau hyperphosphorylation using confocal microscopy and live cell imaging.
RESULTS: Aβ42 added to the medium was endocytosed into neurons, inducing the formation of endolysosomal protofibrils and endolysosomal leakage, which in turn promoted tau hyperphosphorylation. Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) was released from the disrupted lysosomes, and inhibition of this peptidase activity reduced tau hyperphosphorylation.
DISCUSSION: The data suggest a mechanism of AD in which Aβ42 accumulates and aggregates gradually in neurons over time, leading to endolysosomal leakage and release of AEP, which subsequently triggers tau hyperphosphorylation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Aβ42 endocytosis leads to its endolysosomal accumulation in neurons over time. Aβ42 polymerizes into protofibrils and causes endolysosomal leakage. Tau hyperphosphorylation is induced by endolysosomal asparagine endopeptidase leakage. Tau hyperphosphorylation is inhibited by an asparagine endopeptidase inhibitor.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40095668,Elevated circulating cathepsin S levels are associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in a cohort of patients reporting memory complaints.,"BackgroundAs a member of the cysteine protease family, cathepsin S has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), primarily by promoting inflammation.ObjectiveCurrent evidence regarding the role of cathepsin S primarily comes from animal studies. This study aims to explore the clinical relevance of cathepsin S in AD.MethodsIn a cohort of older adults aged 60 or above with memory complaints, we examined baseline plasma levels of cathepsin S and assessed their association with cognitive decline and biomarkers of neurodegeneration during a 36-month follow-up.ResultsPlasma levels of cathepsin S were significantly higher in individuals experiencing longitudinal cognitive decline compared to those without cognitive decline. Furthermore, plasma levels of cathepsin S were associated with declines in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and increases in neurofilament light and pTau181 levels. Higher plasma cathepsin S levels were linked to an increased risk of longitudinal cognitive decline (decrease in MMSE scores of 3 or more), adjusting for age, sex, education, APOE genotype, alcohol consumption, smoking, and comorbidities.ConclusionsThis study provides additional evidence supporting the potential role of cathepsin S in the pathogenesis of AD from a clinical perspective.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40087396,Endothelial TDP-43 depletion disrupts core blood-brain barrier pathways in neurodegeneration.,"Endothelial cells (ECs) help maintain the blood-brain barrier but deteriorate in many neurodegenerative disorders. Here we show, using a specialized method to isolate EC and microglial nuclei from postmortem human cortex (92 donors, 50 male and 42 female, aged 20-98 years), that intranuclear cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes enables simultaneous profiling of nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts at a single-nucleus resolution. We identify a disease-associated subset of capillary ECs in Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. These capillaries exhibit reduced nuclear β-catenin and β-catenin-downstream genes, along with elevated TNF/NF-κB markers. Notably, these transcriptional changes correlate with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein also depleted in neuronal nuclei. TDP-43 disruption in human and mouse ECs replicates these alterations, suggesting that TDP-43 deficiency in ECs is an important factor contributing to blood-brain barrier breakdown in neurodegenerative diseases.",Nat Neurosci,2025
40050704,Microglial mechanisms drive amyloid-β clearance in immunized patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies utilizing amyloid-β (Aβ) immunization have shown potential in clinical trials. Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance Aβ-targeted immunotherapies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.",Nat Med,2025
39941562,Therapeutic Potential of Experimental Stereotactic Hippocampal Cell Transplant in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Due to a continuous increase in life expectancy and the progress made in specialized healthcare, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has dramatically increased to the point that it has become one of the main challenges of contemporary medicine. Despite a huge scientific and clinical effort, current treatments manage just a temporary alleviation of symptomatology but offer no cure. Modern trials involving cell transplantation in experimental animals require the involvement of neurosurgeons in the treatment protocol. CSF shunting, intraventricular infusions, or DBS for symptoms relief have been an integral part of the therapeutic arsenal from the very beginning. The development of stereotactic surgery has facilitated the experimental potential of cell transplantation in the hippocampus for Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a narrative review of the literature in the top three medical databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) using the keywords ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""hippocampus"", and ""transplant"". After eliminating duplicates, 241 papers were selected and screened by title and abstract. Two reviewers independently analyzed the 88 papers and chose 32 experiments that involved stereotactic hippocampal transplantation of cells in experimental animals with AD. The stereotactic transplantation of cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neuronal stem cells (NSCs), induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), astrocytes, and derivates from stem cells was analyzed. The experiments used either a chemically induced or transgenic AD model and observed the impact of the stereotactic transplantation with behavioral testing, MRS spectroscopy, and biochemical analysis. The stereotaxic method delivers minimal invasive treatment option by cell transplantation at the hippocampus. The results showed that amyloid deposits were lower after transplantation, showing a positive impact. Other impactful results involve proliferation of neurogenesis, downregulation of anti-inflammatory response, and increased neuronal plasticity. The increased precision with which the stereotaxic method manages to target deep structures of the brain and the results of the reviewed papers could represent an argument for future human trials. More studies are needed to confirm the viability of the transplanted cells and the long-term effects.",J Clin Med,2025
40158220,Structural basis of oligomerization-modulated activation and autoinhibition of orphan receptor GPR3.,"G protein-coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) is a class A orphan receptor characterized by high constitutive activity in the G<sub>s</sub> signaling pathway. GPR3 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and the regulation of thermogenesis in human adipocytes, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its self-activation and potential endogenous modulators remain unclear. In this study, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GPR3 in different oligomerization states, both in the absence and presence of G protein. Notably, in addition to the monomeric form of GPR3, our findings reveal a functional GPR3 dimer with an extensive dimer interface-a feature rarely observed in class A GPCRs. Moreover, oligomerization appears to be linked to a unique autoinhibition mechanism involving intracellular loops, which may regulate GPR3 signaling. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the oligomerization-modulated activation of orphan GPCRs, advancing our understanding of their signaling properties.",Cell Rep,2025
39956772,Altered functional connectivity between primary visual cortex and cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: It is known that eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions invoke different organizations of brain functional networks, such as sensorimotor, attention, and salience networks in healthy participants. Functional connectivity (FC) extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, under either EO or EC conditions, has been widely applied to explore the neural substrates of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the impact of eye conditions on FC within the AD continuum remains not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects of eye conditions on FC across the AD continuum.
METHODS: FC with the primary visual cortex (V1) seed was analyzed for both EO and EC conditions in 59 amyloid-β (Aβ)-positron emission tomography (PET)-negative cognitively normal (CN-), 14 Aβ-PET-positive CN+, 24 mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 15 AD individuals.
RESULTS: EO and EC differently modulated FC between the V1 and cerebellum, especially the posterior vermis, in all groups. In CN-, CN+, and MCI+ groups, EO significantly facilitated FC between V1 and the cerebellum compared with the EC condition. However, the AD group showed the reverse pattern. Moreover, a sub-analysis demonstrated that the FC significantly correlated with a truncal balance measure under EO, but not EC, in participants with MCI+ and AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the FC between the V1 and cerebellum changed in AD. This finding may partially explain the impaired truncal balance and tendency to fall down in AD. This study suggests that analyzing FC under EO and EC conditions may provide a new functional biomarker for AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39954872,A quantitatively interpretable model for Alzheimer's disease prediction using deep counterfactuals.,"Deep learning (DL) for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) has provided timely intervention in disease progression yet still demands attentive interpretability to explain how their DL models make definitive decisions. Counterfactual reasoning has recently gained increasing attention in medical research because of its ability to provide a refined visual explanatory map. However, such visual explanatory maps based on visual inspection alone are insufficient unless we intuitively demonstrate their medical or neuroscientific validity via quantitative features. In this study, we synthesize the counterfactual-labeled structural MRIs using our proposed framework and transform it into a gray matter density map to measure its volumetric changes over the parcellated region of interest (ROI). We also devised a lightweight linear classifier to boost the effectiveness of constructed ROIs, promoted quantitative interpretation, and achieved comparable predictive performance to DL methods. Throughout this, our framework produces an ""AD-relatedness index"" for each ROI. It offers an intuitive understanding of brain status for an individual patient and across patient groups concerning AD progression.",Neuroimage,2025
40145307,Brain structural alterations in young women with premature ovarian insufficiency: Implications for dementia risk.,"INTRODUCTION: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), marked by ovarian function loss before age 40, is linked to a higher risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associated brain structural changes remain poorly understood.
METHODS: We analyzed T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in 33 idiopathic POI women and 51 healthy controls, using voxel-based, surface-based morphometry, and network analyses to assess gray matter volume (GMV), cortical thickness, and brain connectivity.
RESULTS: Women with POI showed significant GMV and cortical thickness reductions in the frontal, parietal, and temporal regions (p < 0.05), alongside impaired connectivity with key regions such as the hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala (p < 0.05). Younger POI subgroups exhibited changes in more widespread brain regions. In additionally, notable atrophy was observed in specific hippocampal and thalamic subregions in POI (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: This preliminary study suggests early neurodegenerative patterns in POI, potentially contributing to dementia risk. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.
HIGHLIGHTS: We evaluated brain structural changes in participants with idiopathic premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). The observed brain alterations in POI participants closely resemble those seen in early dementia, including regions specifically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight the critical need for early interventions to reduce the long-term risks of cognitive impairment and dementia in women with POI.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39775833,Genetic Analysis of Retinal Cell Types in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"IMPORTANCE: As an accessible part of the central nervous system, the retina provides a unique window to study pathophysiological mechanisms of brain disorders in humans. Imaging and electrophysiological studies have revealed retinal alterations across several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, but it remains largely unclear which specific cell types and biological mechanisms are involved.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether specific retinal cell types are affected by genomic risk for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and to explore the mechanisms through which genomic risk converges in these cell types.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genetic association study combined findings from genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and stroke with retinal single-cell transcriptomic datasets from humans, macaques, and mice. To identify susceptible cell types, Multi-Marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation (MAGMA) cell-type enrichment analyses were applied and subsequent pathway analyses performed. The cellular top hits were translated to the structural level using retinal optical coherence tomography (acquired between 2009 and 2010) and genotyping data in the large population-based UK Biobank cohort study. Data analysis was conducted between 2022 and 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cell type-specific enrichment of genetic risk loading for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorder traits in the gene expression profiles of retinal cells.
RESULTS: Expression profiles of amacrine cells (interneurons within the retina) were robustly enriched in schizophrenia genetic risk across mammalian species and in different developmental stages. This enrichment was primarily driven by genes involved in synapse biology. Moreover, expression profiles of retinal immune cell populations were enriched in multiple sclerosis genetic risk. No consistent cell-type associations were found for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, or stroke. On the structural level, higher polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with thinning of the ganglion cell inner plexiform layer, which contains dendrites and synaptic connections of amacrine cells (B, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03; P = .007; n = 36 349; mean [SD] age, 57.50 [8.00] years; 19 859 female [54.63%]). Higher polygenic risk for multiple sclerosis was associated with increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (B, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.10; P = .007; n = 36 371; mean [SD] age, 57.51 [8.00] years; 19 843 female [54.56%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides novel insights into the cellular underpinnings of retinal alterations in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and highlights the retina as a potential proxy to study synaptic pathology in schizophrenia.",JAMA Psychiatry,2025
39984543,Association of genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive function in two European populations.,"Although there is some evidence of an association between Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk score (AD PRS) and cognitive function, limited validations have been performed in large populations. We investigated the relationship between AD PRS and cognitive function in the UK Biobank in over 276,000 participants and further validated the association in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sample. We developed the AD PRS (excluded the APOE variants) in the middle age UK Biobank participants (age ranged 39-72, mean age 57 years) of European ancestries by LDpred2. To validate the association of AD PRS and cognitive function internally in the UK Biobank, we linearly regressed standardized cognitive function on continuous standardized AD PRS with age at cognitive test, sex, genotyping array, first 10 principal components of genotyping, smoking, education in years, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E gene ε4 (APOE4) risk allele dosages. To validate the associations externally, we ran the linear mixed effects model in the ADNI sample free of dementia (age ranged 55-91, mean age 73), including similar covariates as fixed effects and participants' IDs as the random effect. Stratification by age, APOE4 carrier status, and cognitive status (cognitively normal or mild cognitive impairment) was also investigated. Our study validated the associations of AD PRS and cognitive function in both midlife and late-life observational cohorts. Although not all of the cognitive measures were significantly associated with AD PRS, non-verbal fluid reasoning (matrix pattern completion, β = - 0.022, P = 0.003), processing speed (such as symbol digit substitution, β = - 0.017, P = 1.08E-05), short-term memory and attention (such as pairs matching, β = - 0.014, P = 1.66E-10), and reaction time (β = - 0.010, P = 1.19E-06) were inversely associated with increasing AD PRS in the UK Biobank. Higher likelihood of cognitive impairment was also associated with higher AD PRS in the ADNI cognitive normal individuals (AD assessment scale β = 0.079, P = 0.02). In summary, we confirmed that poorer cognitive function was associated with a higher polygenic AD risk, and suggested the potential utility of the AD PRS in identifying those who may be at risk for further cognitive decline.",Sci Rep,2025
40133283,Emerging biophysical origins and pathogenic implications of amyloid oligomers.,"The amyloid hypothesis has been a leading narrative concerning the pathophysiological foundation of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. At the two ends of the hypothesis lie the functional protein monomers and the pathology-defining amyloid fibrils, while the early stages of protein aggregation are populated by polymorphic, transient and neurotoxic oligomers. As the structure and activity of oligomers are intertwined, here we show oligomers arising from liquid-liquid phase separation and β-barrel formation, their routes to neurodegeneration, and their role in cerebrovascular perturbation. Together, this Perspective converges on the multifaceted oligomer-axis central to the pathological origin and, hence, the treatment of amyloid diseases.",Nat Commun,2025
40147752,Oligomer sensitive in-situ detection and characterization of gold colloid aggregate formations observed within the hippocampus of the Alzheimer's disease rat.,"In order to better understand the dynamics governing the formation of pathological oligomers leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a rat model the present study examined the protein aggregates accumulating on gold colloids in the hippocampus. Sections of the hippocampus of the Long Evans Cohen's AD(+) rat model were mixed with gold colloids and the resulting aggregates were examined by Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) imaging. Compared to AD(-) rat tissues, the AD(+) rat hippocampal tissues produced a larger sized gold colloid aggregates. The SERS spectrum of each hippocampal section exhibited similar spectral patterns in the Amide I, II, and III band regions, but showed distinct spectral patterns in the region between 300 cm<sup>-1</sup> - 1250 cm<sup>-1</sup> in AD(+) rat tissues, respectively. Amyloid fibrils with a β-sheet conformation were previously reported to form gold colloid aggregates in mouse and human AD brain tissues. The gold colloid aggregates in the AD (+) rat hippocampal brain sections showed distinct morphological traits compared to those observed in AD(-) rats. This suggests that there is a spatial distribution of oligomer concentration in the hippocampus, which induces fibril formation to disrupt neuronal networks within the hippocampus and between other parts of the brain.",Neurosci Lett,2025
40095481,Dementia diagnosis and prescription of antidementia drugs: An analysis of German claims data (2006-2016).,"BackgroundUse of claims data allows to analyze health service characteristics of dementia, which is one of the most frequent cognitive disorders in Germany and worldwide.ObjectiveThe study aimed at describing the variability in dementia diagnoses and in antidementia drug prescription pattern.MethodsWe analyzed data from a population-based sample of one of the largest German statutory health insurances. The cohort included 30,403 patients with incident dementia diagnosis from 2006-2016. We described frequencies, patterns, and interrelations of diagnoses (Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, other specific dementia, unspecified dementia (UD), antidementia drugs (ADD), and professional groups. We described switches in diagnostic and medication patterns between index quarter and following quarters, and evaluated the prescriptions in relation to national guidelines.ResultsA total of 87% of patients received a diagnosis of UD in at least one quarter of insurance. In the quarter of incident diagnosis, 14% of patients received more than one diagnostic code of dementia, whereas over the course of observation, the majority of patients received more than one diagnostic code (61%). Most patients were diagnosed by a general practitioner without involving a specialist. All professional groups primarily made UD diagnoses except specialists who mainly diagnosed AD. Thirty-five percent of all patients and 67% of AD patients were prescribed an ADD at least once.ConclusionsSpecialists made the most specific diagnoses and prescribed most ADDs. A specialist consultation may be advisable, but only 34% of patients visited one. Many AD patients might be left untreated due to underdiagnosis or -treatment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39774485,"APOE4 and infectious diseases jointly contribute to brain glucose hypometabolism, a biomarker of Alzheimer's pathology: New findings from the ADNI.","BACKGROUND: Impaired brain glucose metabolism is a preclinical feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Infections may promote AD-related pathology. Therefore, we investigated the interplay between infections and APOE4, a strong genetic risk factor for AD.
METHODS: We analyzed data on 1,509 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using multivariate linear regression models. The outcomes were rank-normalized hypometabolic convergence index (HCI), statistical regions of interest (SROI) for AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Marginal mean estimates for infections, stratified by APOE4 carrier status, were then computed.
RESULTS: Prior infections were associated with greater HCI [β = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.27, p = 0.01]. The combined effects of infections and APOE4 carriers on HCI levels were significantly greater than either variable alone. Among APOE4 carriers, the estimated marginal mean was 0.62, rising to 0.77, with infections (p<0.001), indicating an interaction effect. Carriers with multiple infections showed greater hypometabolism (higher HCI), with an estimate of 0.44 (p = 0.01) compared to 0.11 (p = 0.08) for those with a single infection, revealing a dose-response relationship. The estimates for the association of infections with SROI AD and SROI MCI were β = -0.01 (p = 0.02) and β = -0.01 (p = 0.04), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that infections and APOE4 jointly contribute to brain glucose hypometabolism and AD pathology, supporting a ""multi-hit"" mechanism in AD development.",PLoS One,2025
40123639,"Influence of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and diagnostic factors on financial capacity: A longitudinal analysis of the ADNI cohort.","INTRODUCTION: Financial capacity (FC) is the ability to independently manage finances in a manner consistent with one's self-interest. To investigate the relationship between FC, cognitive domains, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and transitions from normal cognition (cognitive normal [CN]) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted a secondary analysis of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort using the Financial Capacity Instrument short form (FCI-SF).
METHODS: To examine these longitudinal relationships, we fit two models, a random effects (random intercept) ""time-averaged"" model and a ""time since previous visit"" model, where we regressed each of the five component financial scores on each of the cognitive composite scores. To examine the effect of baseline FCI-SF performance on conversion rates from normal to MCI or AD, we computed a survival model.
RESULTS: A total of 874 participants (diagnostic group, N, mean age: CN: 501, 74.4; MCI: 319, 74.6; and AD 54, 74.9) were included in the analyses. In time since previous visit models, we found that lower executive function composite scores were related to decline in the complex checkbook score (ß = 1.35 (0.55), p = 0.016) and total completion time of the FCI-SF (ß = 1.85 (9.36), p = 0.025). In addition, lower composite visuospatial score was significantly related to poorer performance on financial conceptual knowledge, complex checkbook, and total completion time. Lower composite memory score was highly related to decline in financial conceptual knowledge, single checkbook, and bank statement subscale scores. ADNI participants in the lowest tertile of total completion time, at any point in time, were four times more likely to receive a diagnosis of MCI or AD compared to participants in the highest tertile with a hazard ratio of 4.22 ([2.29] p = 008).
DISCUSSION: There is a multifaceted interaction between poorer cognition and everyday financial function where executive function, memory, and visuospatial cognition are related to FC. The strongest predictor of conversion from normal to either MCI or AD, appears to be time to completion.
HIGHLIGHTS: Decline in financial capacity (FC) is observed during transition to dementia and increases the risk of negative outcomes.Executive function, memory, and visuospatial cognition are related to FC.The strongest predictor of conversion from normal to either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) is time to completion or processing speed.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39932627,Reduction of Neuroinflammation as a Common Mechanism of Action of Anorexigenic and Orexigenic Peptide Analogues in the Triple Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer´s Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, AD typically begins with mild cognitive decline escalating to severe impairment in communication and responsiveness. It primarily affects cerebral regions responsible for cognition, memory, and language processing, significantly impeding the functional independence of patients. With nearly 50 million dementia cases worldwide, a number expected to triple by 2050, the need for effective treatments is more urgent than ever. Recent insights into the association between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and neurodegenerative disorders have led to the development of promising treatments involving antidiabetic and anti-obesity agents. One such novel promising candidate for addressing AD pathology is a lipidized analogue of anorexigenic peptide called prolactin-releasing peptide (palm<sup>11</sup>-PrRP31). Interestingly, anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides have opposite effects on food intake regulation, however, both types exhibit neuroprotective properties. Recent studies have also identified ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, as a potential neuroprotective agent. Hence, we employed both anorexigenic and orexigenic compounds to investigate the common mechanisms underpinning their neuroprotective effects in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD mouse model) combining amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and Tau pathology, two hallmarks of AD. We treated 3xTg-AD mice for 4 months with two stable lipidized anorexigenic peptide analogues - palm<sup>11</sup>-PrRP31, and liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue - as well as Dpr<sup>3</sup>-ghrelin, a stable analogue of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin, and using the method of immunohistochemistry and western blot demonstrate the effects of these compounds on the development of AD-like pathology in the brain. Palm<sup>11</sup>-PrRP31, Dpr<sup>3</sup>-ghrelin, and liraglutide reduced intraneuronal deposits of Aβ plaque load in the hippocampi and amygdalae of 3xTg-AD mice. Palm<sup>11</sup>-PrRP31 and Dpr<sup>3</sup>-ghrelin reduced microgliosis in the hippocampi, amygdalae, and cortices of 3xTg-AD mice. Palm<sup>11</sup>-PrRP31 and liraglutide reduced astrocytosis in the amygdalae of 3xTg-AD mice. We propose that these peptides are involved in reducing inflammation, a common mechanism underlying their therapeutic effects. This is the first study to demonstrate improvements in AD pathology following the administration of both orexigenic and anorexigenic compounds, highlighting the therapeutic potential of food intake-regulating peptides in neurodegenerative disorders.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2025
39744523,Targeted plasma metabolomics reveals potential biomarkers of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment in Qingdao rural area.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous research has suggested a link between the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and metabolic disorder; however, the findings have been inconsistent. To date, the majority of metabolomics studies have focused on AD, resulting in a relative paucity of research on early-stage conditions such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underexplored. In this study, we employed a comprehensive platform for the early screening of individuals with MCI using high-throughput targeted metabolomics.
METHOD: We included 171 participants including 124 individuals with MCI and 47 healthy subjects. Univariate statistical analysis was conducted using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with p-values corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The screening criteria were set at FDR &lt; 0.05 and fold change (FC) &gt; 1.5 or &lt; 0.67. Multivariate analysis was performed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), where differential metabolites were identified based on variable influence on projection (VIP) scores (VIP &gt; 1 and FDR &lt; 0.05). Random forest analysis was used to further evaluate the ability of the metabolic data to distinguish effectively between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 14 differential metabolites were identified, leading to the discovery of a biomarker panel consisting of three plasma metabolites including uric acid, pyruvic acid and isolithocholic acid that effectively distinguished MCI patients from healthy subjects.
DISCUSSION: These findings have provided a comprehensive metabolic profile, offering valuable insights into the early prediction and understanding of the pathogenic processes underlying MCI. This study holds the potential for advancing early detection and intervention strategies for MCI.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39907902,Long Non-Coding RNAs: Crucial Regulators in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis and Prospects for Precision Medicine.,"Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. With the capacity to modulate gene expression at various levels, LncRNAs are implicated in multiple pathological mechanisms of AD, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau protein phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of LncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets due to their differential expression patterns in AD patients. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of LncRNAs in AD, focusing on their involvement in key molecular pathways and their promise as indicators for early diagnosis and prognosis. We discuss the regulatory networks of LncRNAs in the context of AD, their interaction with miRNAs, and the implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Despite the complexity and variability in LncRNA function, the prospect of harnessing these molecules for precision medicine in AD is gaining momentum. The translational potential of LncRNA-based interventions offers a new frontier in the quest for effective treatments and a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40110684,Marital status and risk of dementia over 18 years: Surprising findings from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.,"INTRODUCTION: Marital status is a potential risk/protective factor for adverse health outcomes. This study tested whether marital status was associated with dementia risk in older adults.
METHODS: Participants (N = 24,107; Mean<sub>age </sub>= 71.79) were from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Cox regressions tested the association between baseline marital status and clinically ascertained dementia over up to 18 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared to married participants, widowed (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.67-0.79), divorced (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.59-0.73), and never-married participants (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.52-0.71) were at lower dementia risk, including for Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. The associations for divorced and never married remained significant accounting for demographic, behavioral, clinical, genetic, referral source, participation, and diagnostic factors. The associations were slightly stronger among professional referrals, males, and relatively younger participants.
DISCUSSION: Unmarried individuals may have a lower risk of dementia compared to married adults. The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals or challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Widowed, divorced, and never-married older adults had a lower dementia risk, compared to their married counterparts. Unmarried older adults were also at a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, with a pattern of mixed findings for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and no associations with risk of vascular dementia or mild cognitive impairment. All unmarried groups were at a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There was some evidence of moderation by age, sex, and referral source. However, stratified analyses showed small differences between groups, and most interactions were not significant, suggesting that the role of marital status in dementia tends to be similar across individuals at different levels of dementia risk due to education, depression, and genetic vulnerability.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39945003,"Comparative the efficacy and safety of Gosuranemab, Semorinemab, Tilavonemab, and Zagotenemab in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau protein aggregation, a key pathological feature of AD, is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Targeting tau protein has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. By investigating the effects of monoclonal antibodies on cognitive function, disease progression, and overall quality of life in patients with AD, which can provide valuable insights into their potential as a therapeutic option for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of Gosuranemab, Semorinemab, Tilavonemab, and Zagotenemab in Alzheimer's disease (AD) were systematically searched across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, up to May 2024. The control group included placebo. The efficacy indicators were change in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) from baseline until the time of efficacy observation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 14 and RevMan 5.4. The purpose of data processing, including generating network evidence plots, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, league plots, and funnel plots, is to visually summarize and evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety and potential publication bias of multiple interventions. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) as effect sizes to analyze continuous variables.
RESULTS: This study encompassed six RCTs involving 2,193 patients. Semorinemab were more effective than placebo in MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores (MDs ranging between 0.52 and 3.21; MDs ranging between 0.17 and 3.30). Placebo showed relatively good efficacy according to SUCRA ranking on change in CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL scores (75.7 and 79.5%). Tilavonemab and Semorinemab exhibited efficacy similar to that of a placebo in the analysis of the two indicators. Tilavonemab showed a lower incidence of AE, SAE, fall, and urinary tract infections than placebo, and the differences were statistically significant. Most safety analysis results showed no statistical difference.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that anti-tau protein monoclonal antibodies, such as Semorinemab and Tilavonemab, showed promise in terms of efficacy and safety for managing AD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, assess long-term effects, and refine treatment protocols.

40142784,Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists: Exciting Avenues Beyond Weight Loss.,"The last two decades have proffered many remarkable choices in managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Leading the list are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs), the first of which, exenatide, was approved by the FDA in 2005. Two other major classes of drugs have also entered the market: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, commonly known as gliptins and approved in 2006, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, with the first approval occurring in 2013. These drugs have revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. Additionally, on the horizon, the once-weekly basal insulin analog insulin icodec and the once-weekly combination of insulin icodec and semaglutide are expected to be available in the future. Beyond glycemic control, GLP1RAs have exhibited benefits in conditions associated with diabetes, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, emerging research suggests potential roles in certain types of cancer, infertility, and associative learning. Major cardiovascular events seem to be lower in patients on GLP1RAs. While some evidence is robust, other findings remain tenuous. It is important that clinicians are familiar with current research in order to provide optimal evidence-based care to patients. In the not-too-distant future, there may be a case to prescribe these drugs for benefits outside diabetes.",J Clin Med,2025
39715476,Comparison of Plasma p-tau217 and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET for Identifying Alzheimer Disease in People With Early-Onset or Atypical Dementia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic performance of an immunoassay for plasma concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 with visual assessments of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET in individuals who meet appropriate use criteria for Alzheimer dementia (AD) biomarker assessments.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals with early-onset (age &lt;65 years at onset) and/or atypical dementia (features other than memory at onset), who were evaluated at a tertiary care memory clinic. All participants underwent measurements of CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau181, and total tau levels), as well as [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET scans, amyloid-PET scans, and plasma p-tau217 quantifications. To determine whether the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET images were compatible with AD, images were visually rated by 2 nuclear medicine experts. Using a contingency analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET scan interpretation and plasma p-tau217 for an AD biomarker profile in CSF and for amyloid-PET positivity.
RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals with early onset and/or atypical dementia were included in this study (mean age = 65 years; 48/81 female (59%). Both [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET and plasma p-tau217 showed high levels of agreement with reference standard AD biomarkers ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET area under the curve [AUC]: 71%; plasma p-tau217 AUC: 81%). Although both biomarkers had similar specificity for AD [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81; plasma p-tau217: 70%, CI: 0.56-0.81), plasma p-tau217 had higher sensitivity for AD (plasma p-tau217: 97%, CI: 0.85-0.99 vs [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET: 73%, CI: 0.57-0.85) (p = 0.01).

The same pattern of results was observed when using amyloid-PET as the reference standard.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides evidence that plasma p-tau217 has strong discriminative accuracy for AD among patients with early-onset and/or atypical dementia assessed in specialized settings. Future work should replicate these findings in secondary care settings.",Neurology,2025
39937416,Application of the Trend of miRNA Expression Levels in APP/PS1 Mice Plasma for the Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and seriously affects people's quality of life. In recent years, many circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. However, there are no reliable miRNAs for early diagnosis of AD because miRNAs are dynamically changing during the disease process. The present study was to seek reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD by detecting changes in miRNAs in plasma from young APPswe/PS1Δ9 double-transgenic mice (APP/PS1 mice) using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. Some behavioral experiments and pathological tests were used to characterize the progress of AD in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The results showed that the expression levels of several plasma miRNAs targeting BACE1 and APP showed consistent trends in the early stages of APP/PS1 mice. The expression levels of miR-34a-5p, miR-29c-3p, miR-107-3p, and miR-101a-3p in the plasma of APP/PS1 female mice decreased with cognitive decline, demonstrating their potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis of female AD patients. The expression levels of these miRNAs fluctuated significantly in APP/PS1 male mice, and the reason for this difference may be related to the biological sex differences in AD. This fluctuation may serve as an indicative risk signal for the early stage of AD in male patients.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39713236,Functional network disruption in cognitively unimpaired autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease: a magnetoencephalography study.,"Understanding the nature and onset of neurophysiological changes, and the selective vulnerability of central hub regions in the functional network, may aid in managing the growing impact of Alzheimer's disease on society. However, the precise neurophysiological alterations occurring in the pre-clinical stage of human Alzheimer's disease remain controversial. This study aims to provide increased insights on quantitative neurophysiological alterations during a true early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Using high spatial resolution source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography, we investigated regional and whole-brain neurophysiological changes in a unique cohort of 11 cognitively unimpaired individuals with pathogenic mutations in the presenilin-1 or amyloid precursor protein gene and a 1:3 matched control group (n = 33) with a median age of 49 years. We examined several quantitative magnetoencephalography measures that have been shown robust in detecting differences in sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients and are sensitive to excitation-inhibition imbalance. This includes spectral power and functional connectivity in different frequency bands. We also investigated hub vulnerability using the hub disruption index. To understand how magnetoencephalography measures change as the disease progresses through its pre-clinical stage, correlations between magnetoencephalography outcomes and various clinical variables like age were analysed. A comparison of spectral power between mutation carriers and controls revealed oscillatory slowing, characterized by widespread higher theta (4-8 Hz) power, a lower posterior peak frequency and lower occipital alpha 2 (10-13 Hz) power. Functional connectivity analyses presented a lower whole-brain (amplitude-based) functional connectivity in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, predominantly located in parieto-temporal hub regions. Furthermore, we found a significant hub disruption index for (phase-based) functional connectivity in the theta band, attributed to both higher functional connectivity in 'non-hub' regions alongside a hub disruption. Neurophysiological changes did not correlate with indicators of pre-clinical disease progression in mutation carriers after multiple comparisons correction. Our findings provide evidence that oscillatory slowing and functional connectivity differences occur before cognitive impairment in individuals with autosomal dominant mutations leading to early onset Alzheimer's disease. The nature and direction of these alterations are comparable to those observed in the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggest an early excitation-inhibition imbalance, and fit with the activity-dependent functional degeneration hypothesis. These insights may prove useful for early diagnosis and intervention in the future.",Brain Commun,2024
39713247,Clinical and demographic factors modify the association between plasma phosphorylated tau-181 and cognition.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) associations with global cognition and memory are clear, but the link between p-tau181 with other cognitive domains and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) across the clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how this association changes based on genetic and demographic factors is poorly understood.
METHODS: Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and included 1185 adults &gt;55 years of age with plasma p-tau181 and neuropsychological test data. Linear regression models related plasma p-tau181 to neuropsychological composite and SCD scores with follow-up models examining plasma p-tau181 interactions with cognitive diagnosis, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status, age, and sex on cognitive outcomes.
RESULTS: Higher plasma p-tau181 level was associated with worse memory, executive functioning, and language abilities, and greater informant-reported SCD. Visuospatial abilities and self-report SCD were not associated with plasma p-tau181. Associations were generally stronger in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, APOE ε4 carriers, women, and younger participants.
DISCUSSION: Higher levels of plasma p-tau181 are associated with worse neuropsychological test performance across multiple cognitive domains; however, these associations vary based on disease stage, genetic risk status, age, and sex.
HIGHLIGHTS: Greater plasma p-tau181 was associated with lower cognition across most domains.Associations between p-tau181 and cognition were modified by age and sex.Level of p-tau181 was more strongly associated with cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2024
39930140,Longitudinal analysis of a dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease mutation carrier protected from dementia.,"We conducted an in-depth longitudinal study on an individual carrying the presenilin 2 p.Asn141Ile mutation, traditionally associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD), who has remarkably remained asymptomatic past the expected age of clinical onset. This study combines genetic, neuroimaging and biomarker analyses to explore the underpinnings of this resilience. Unlike typical progression in dominantly inherited AD, tau pathology in this case was confined to the occipital region without evidence of spread, potentially explaining the preservation of cognitive functions. Genetic analysis revealed several variants that, although not previously associated with protection against AD, suggest new avenues for understanding disease resistance. Notably, environmental factors such as significant heat exposure and a unique proteomic profile rich in heat shock proteins might indicate adaptive mechanisms contributing to the observed phenotype. This case underscores the complexity of Alzheimer's pathology and suggests that blocking tau deposition could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention. The study highlights the need for further research to identify and validate the mechanisms that could inhibit or localize tau pathology as a strategy to mitigate or delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia.",Nat Med,2025
39911347,Distinct disruptions in CA1 and CA3 place cell function in Alzheimer's disease mice.,"The hippocampus, a critical brain structure for spatial learning and memory, is susceptible to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Utilizing APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, we investigated neurophysiological mechanisms underlying AD-associated cognitive impairments by assessing place cell activities in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions, which have distinct yet complementary computational roles. Analyses revealed significant deterioration in spatial representation capabilities of APP/PS1 relative to wild-type (WT) mice. Specifically, CA1 place cells exhibited reduction in coherence and spatial information, while CA3 place cells displayed reduction in place field size. Place cells in both subregions showed disruption in stability and burst firing properties. Furthermore, theta rhythm was significantly attenuated in CA1 place cells of APP/PS1 mice. These findings elucidate that distinct physiological perturbations in CA1 and CA3 place cells, coupled with disrupted hippocampal theta rhythmicity in CA1, potentially orchestrate the impairment of hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in AD pathogenesis.",iScience,2025

39894909,Iron chelation by oral deferoxamine treatment decreased brain iron and iron signaling proteins.,"BACKGROUND: Deferoxamine (DFO) and other iron chelators are clinically used for cancer and stroke. They may also be useful for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to diminish iron from microbleeds. DFO may also stimulate antioxidant membrane repair which is impaired during AD. DFO and other chelators do enter the brain despite some contrary reports.
OBJECTIVE: Low dose, oral DFO was given in lab chow to wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice to evaluate potential impact on iron levels, iron-signaling and storage proteins, and amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and processing enzymes. Young WT mice do not have microbleeds or disrupted blood-brain barrier of AD mice.
METHODS: Iron was measured by MRI and chemically after two weeks of dietary DFO. Cerebral cortex was examined for changes in iron metabolism, antioxidant signaling, and AβPP processing by western blot.
RESULTS: DFO decreased brain iron 18% (p &lt; 0.01) estimated by R2 MRI and decreased seven major proteins that mediate iron metabolism by at least 25%. The iron storage proteins ferritin light and heavy chain decreased by at least 30%. AβPP and secretase enzymes also decreased by 30%.
CONCLUSIONS: WT mice respond to DFO with decreased AβPP, amyloid processing enzymes, and antioxidant repair. Potential DFO treatment for early-stage AD by DFO should consider the benefits of lowered AβPP and secretase enzymes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39700174,Unveiling Cathepsin B inhibition with repurposed drugs for anticancer and anti-Alzheimer's drug discovery.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and the formation of plaques in the brain, primarily derived from the proteolytic degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cathepsin B (CatB) is a cysteine protease that plays a pivotal role in this process, making it a potential target for the development of anti-Alzheimer's therapies. Apart from AD, CatB is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Given the critical role of CatB in these diseases, identifying effective inhibitors is of significant therapeutic interest. In this study, we employed a systematic virtual screening approach using repurposed molecules from the DrugBank database to identify potential CatB inhibitors. Primarily, we focused on binding affinities and selectivity to pinpoint potential hits against CatB. Two repurposed molecules, Lurasidone and Paliperidone, emerged as promising candidates with significant affinity for CatB. These molecules demonstrated favorable drug profiles and exhibited preferential binding to the catalytic pocket of CatB via interacting with functionally significant residues. To further explore the binding mechanism and stability of the CatB-drug complexes, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for 500 ns. The results revealed that CatB and Lurasidone, as well as Paliperidone, form stable complexes throughout the simulation. Taken together, the findings suggest that Lurasidone and Paliperidone can act as repurposed CatB inhibitors with potential applications in the development of therapeutics against AD and other CatB-associated diseases after further validation.",PLoS One,2024
39699442,Brown adipose tissue enhances exercise performance and healthful longevity.,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a major subtypes of adipose tissues, is known for thermogenesis and promoting healthful longevity. Our hypothesis is that BAT protects against impaired healthful longevity, i.e., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and reduced exercise tolerance. While most prior studies have shown that exercise regulates BAT activation and improves BAT density, relatively few have shown that BAT increases exercise performance. In contrast, our recent studies with the regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) knockout (KO) model of extended longevity showed that it enhances exercise performance, mediated by its more potent BAT, compared with BAT from wild type mice. For example, when the BAT from RGS14 KO mice is transplanted to WT mice, their exercise capacity is enhanced at 3 days after BAT transplantation, whereas BAT transplantation from WT to WT mice increased exercise performance, but only at 8 weeks after transplantation. The goal of this research perspective is to review the role of BAT in mediating healthful longevity, specifically exercise capacity. In view of the ability of BAT to mediate healthful longevity and enhance exercise performance, it is likely that a pharmaceutical analog of BAT will become a novel therapeutic modality.",Aging (Albany NY),2024
39763634,Contributions of connectional pathways to shaping Alzheimer's disease pathologies.,"Four important imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, namely grey matter atrophy, glucose hypometabolism and amyloid-β and tau deposition, follow stereotypical spatial distributions shaped by the brain network of structural and functional connections. In this case-control study, we combined several predictors reflecting various possible mechanisms of spreading through structural and functional pathways to predict the topography of the four biomarkers in amyloid-positive patients while controlling for the effect of spatial distance along the cortex. For each biomarker, we quantified the relative contribution of each predictor to the variance explained by the model. We also compared the contribution between apolipoprotein E-ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. We found that topological proximity to areas of maximal pathology through the functional connectome explained significant parts of variance for all biomarkers and that functional pathways totalized more than 30% of contributions for hypometabolism and amyloid load. By contrast, atrophy and tau load were mainly predicted by structural pathways, with major contributions from inter-regional diffusion. The ɛ4 allele modulated contributions to the four biomarkers in a way consistent with compromised brain connectomics in carriers. Our approach can be used to assess the contribution of concurrent mechanisms in other neurodegenerative diseases and the possible modifying impact of relevant factors on this contribution.",Brain Commun,2025
40181481,Evaluating the diagnostic performance of six plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative dementias in a large Chinese cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Ethnic variations and detection methods may lead to differences in diagnostic biomarkers of dementia, and few comparative studies have evaluated the six plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias in the Chinese population.
METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort of 668 participants were enrolled, including 245 amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD patients with Aβ positive pathology, 67 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 100 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 72 with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 184 healthy controls. Additionally, a longitudinal subset of 19 aMCI and 30 AD patients was followed for an average period of 1 year. Plasma biomarkers, including p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, NfL, GFAP, and α-synuclein, were simultaneously measured using a novel single molecular array method. Aβ42 and p-tau181 levels in CSF, amyloid PET and structural MRI were measured.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau231 were most effective in diagnosing aMCI/AD (AUC = 0.95 and 0.93, respectively), while p-tau217, p-tau231 and p-tau181 presented the best differential diagnosis for AD from PSP, FTD and DLB respectively (AUC = 0.84, 0.81 and 0.83). α-synuclein was presented as the best biomarker for PSP variant and behavior variant FTD subtypes (AUC = 0.81 and 0.74, respectively). Among them, p-tau217, p-tau231, GFAP and a-synuclein were negatively correlated with CSF Aβ42/40, while p-tau217 and GFAP were positively correlated with CSF p-tau181. Besides, p-tau181, p-tau217, and GFAP were associated with temporal lobe volume, while p-tau231 and GFAP were associated with frontal lobe volume. Longitudinal analysis showed the higher p-tau181 could predict the cognitive decline progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study validate the practicality of blood biomarkers in the Chinese Han population using a novel single molecule immune detection method. Through the clinical performance study for several biomarkers, we found the plasma p-tau217 was the most effective biomarker in AD diagnosis, and p-tau showed high accuracy for differential diagnosis of AD from other dementia, GFAP is associated with multiple aspects of AD pathology, and frontal and temporal lobe volume, and p-tau181 can reflect the dynamic cognitive decline of AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39878109,Association Between Metabolomics Findings and Brain Hypometabolism in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with rising prevalence due to the aging global population. Existing methods for diagnosing AD are struggling to detect the condition in its earliest and most treatable stages. One early indicator of AD is a substantial decrease in the brain's glucose metabolism. Metabolomics can detect metabolic disturbances in biofluids, which may be advantageous for early detection of some ADrelated changes. The study aims to predict brain hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease using metabolomics findings and develop a predictive model based on metabolomic data.
METHODS: The data used in this study were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study with three assessment time points to investigate the predictive ability of baseline metabolomic data for modeling longitudinal fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) trajectory changes in AD patients. A total number of 44 participants with AD were included. The cognitive abilities of participants were evaluated using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), while the overall severity of dementia was measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We employed the ADNI's FDG MetaROIs (Meta Regions of Interest) dataset to identify AD-associated hypometabolism in the brain. These MetaROIs were selected based on areas frequently mentioned in FDG-PET studies of AD and MCI subjects.
RESULTS: Across models, we observed consistent positive relationships between specific cholesterol esters - CE (20:3) (p = 0.005) and CE (18:3) (p = 0.0039) - and FDG-PET metrics, indicating these baseline metabolites may be valuable indicators of future PET score changes. Selected triglycerides like DG-O (16:0-20:4) also showed time-specific positive associations (p = 0.017).
CONCLUSION: This research provides new insights into the disruptions in the metabolic network linked to AD pathology. These findings could pave the way for identifying novel biomarkers and potential treatment targets for AD.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025

39989286,"Associations of hippocampal volumes, brain hypometabolism, and plasma NfL with amyloid, tau, and cognitive decline.","INTRODUCTION: Various indicators of neurodegeneration (N) are used in the assessment of neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The heterogeneity of such indicators is less clear.
METHODS: A total of 416 individuals with different cognitive statuses were recruited for this study. Differential associations of hippocampal volume (HV), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs), and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels with amyloid beta (Aβ)-tau pathology and cognitive impairment were examined.
RESULTS: HV decreased early during the high Aβ burden but tau-negative stage. FDG PET SUVRs and plasma NfL levels notably changed at tau-positive stages. HV and plasma NfL correlated with cognitive scores in the early to middle stages, while FDG PET SUVRs aligned with cognitive decline from the middle to late stages. Hippocampal atrophy and inferior parietal hypometabolism increased the risk of cognitive impairment in A+T+, while adding NfL+ had no additional impact within the distinct A/T groups.
DISCUSSION: Different indicators of N have varying relationships to AD pathology and cognitive impairment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hippocampal atrophy emerges early with a high amyloid beta burden and exacerbates during the tau-positive phase. Brain hypometabolism and elevated plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels appear mainly in tau-positive stages. Hippocampal volume and plasma NfL levels correlate with cognitive decline in the early to middle stages, while 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography standardized uptake value ratios in the middle to late stages. Hippocampal atrophy and inferior parietal hypometabolism raise the risk of cognitive impairment in amyloid/tau-positive individuals while adding NfL+ shows no additional effect.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39801060,The association between dual sensory impairment and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Sensory impairments have been linked to dementia. However, the impact of dual sensory impairment (DSI), combining both vision impairment and hearing impairment, on dementia has shown inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence on the association DSI and dementia.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases. Included studies were prospective or retrospective cohort studies and a case-control study. The primary outcome was the onset of dementia or its various subtypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Effect sizes, including hazard ratios (HRs), were pooled through a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 11 observational studies with 346,659 participants were included. DSI was significantly associated with the incidence of dementia compared to no sensory impairment (9 studies; HR: 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-1.65). Among subtypes of dementia, DSI was associated with AD onset (4 studies; HR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.45-2.94); however, this association was not found in VaD (2 studies; HR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.96-2.85).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DSI is significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia. Further research is required to identify preventive strategies to decrease the incidence of dementia in individuals with sensory impairment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40108996,Interactions between menopause and high-fat diet on cognition and pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Post-menopausal women constitute about two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Menopause increases dementia risk by heightening the likelihood of metabolic disease, a well-known risk factor for dementia. We aimed to determine the effects of menopause and high-fat diet (HF) on cognitive and pathological outcomes in an AD mouse model.
METHODS: At 3 months old, App<sup>NL-F</sup> mice received 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (menopause model) or vehicle and were placed on a control (10% fat) or an HF diet (60% fat) until 10 months old.
RESULTS: An interaction between HF diet and menopause led to impaired recognition memory. No effects of menopause were observed on amyloid pathology. However, menopause induced alterations in microglial response, white matter, and hippocampal neurogenesis.
DISCUSSION: This work highlights the need to model endocrine aging in animal models of dementia and contributes to further understanding of the interaction between menopause and metabolic health in the context of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The combination of menopause and HF diet led to early onset of cognitive impairment. HF diet increased amyloid pathology in the hippocampus. Menopause led to an increase in microglia density and a decrease in myelin in the corpus callosum. Menopause altered hippocampal neurogenesis in a diet-dependent manner.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

The efficacy and safety of low-dose (105 mg or 225 mg) gantenerumab were investigated in SCarlet RoAD (SR; NCT01224106), a Phase III, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled study in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Following a pre-planned futility analysis, SR was converted into an open-label extension (OLE) study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of SC gantenerumab at doses of up to 1200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in OLE participants who previously received placebo or gantenerumab in the DB part of SR.
METHODS: Participants of the DB part of SR, who met the eligibility criteria for the OLE, were offered the opportunity to receive gantenerumab up-titrated to 1200 mg Q4W according to prespecified titration regimens. Safety and tolerability were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physical and neurologic examinations, and adverse event monitoring.
RESULTS: Overall, 154 participants were rolled over from the DB part of SR and received at least one dose of gantenerumab in the SR OLE. The median duration of treatment was 2.9 years (152.9 weeks). Forty-seven (30.5%) participants had an amyloid-related imaging abnormalities - edema (ARIA-E) MRI finding, and 51 (33.1%) had an ARIA - hemorrhage MRI finding. Most ARIA-E findings were asymptomatic and manageable by MRI monitoring and dose intervention. There were no unexpected safety findings.

39759398,Multidimensional relationships between sensory perception and cognitive aging.,"A growing literature suggests that declines in sensory/perceptual systems predate cognitive declines in aging, and furthermore, they are highly predictive for developing Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias (ADRD). While vision, hearing, olfaction, and vestibular function have each been shown to be related to ADRD, their causal relations to cognitive declines, how they interact with each other remains to be clarified. Currently, there is substantial debate whether sensory/perceptual systems that fail early in disease progression are causal in their contributions to cognitive load and/or social isolation or are simply coincident declines due to aging. At the same time, substantial declines in any of these senses requires compensation, can strain other neural processes and impact activities of daily living, including social engagement, quality of life, and the risk of falls. In this perspective piece, we review literature that illustrates the different relationships between sensory/perceptual systems, cognitive aging and ADRD. We suggest that broadly administered and precise assessment of sensory/perceptual functions could facilitate early detection of ADRD and pave the way for intervention strategies that could help reduce the multifaceted risk of developing ADRD and to improve everyday functioning as people age.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39825890,"Comparison of the amyloid plaque proteome in Down syndrome, early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.","Down syndrome (DS) is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to APP overexpression, exhibiting Amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau pathology similar to early-onset (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). We evaluated the Aβ plaque proteome of DS, EOAD, and LOAD using unbiased localized proteomics on post-mortem paraffin-embedded tissues from four cohorts (n = 20/group): DS (59.8 ± 4.99 y/o), EOAD (63 ± 4.07 y/o), LOAD (82.1 ± 6.37 y/o), and controls (66.4 ± 13.04). We identified differentially abundant proteins when comparing Aβ plaques and neighboring non-plaque tissue (FDR &lt; 5%, fold-change &gt; 1.5) in DS (n = 132), EOAD (n = 192), and LOAD (n = 128), with 43 plaque-associated proteins shared across all groups. Positive correlations were observed between plaque-associated proteins in DS and EOAD (R<sup>2</sup> = .77), DS and LOAD (R<sup>2</sup> = .73), and EOAD and LOAD (R<sup>2</sup> = .67). Top gene ontology biological processes (GOBP) included lysosomal transport (p = 1.29 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) for DS, immune system regulation (p = 4.33 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) for EOAD, and lysosome organization (p = 0.029) for LOAD. Protein networks revealed a plaque-associated protein signature involving APP metabolism, immune response, and lysosomal functions. In DS, EOAD, and LOAD non-plaque vs. control tissue, we identified 263, 269, and 301 differentially abundant proteins, with 65 altered proteins shared across all cohorts. Non-plaque proteins in DS showed modest correlations with EOAD (R<sup>2</sup> = .59) and LOAD (R<sup>2</sup> = .33) compared to the correlation between EOAD and LOAD (R<sup>2</sup> = .79). Top GOBP term for all groups was chromatin remodeling (p &lt; 0.001), with additional terms for DS including extracellular matrix, and protein-DNA complexes and gene expression regulation for EOAD and LOAD. Our study reveals key functional characteristics of the amyloid plaque proteome in DS, compared to EOAD and LOAD, highlighting shared pathways in endo/lysosomal functions and immune responses. The non-plaque proteome revealed distinct alterations in ECM and chromatin structure, underscoring unique differences between DS and AD subtypes.

40042433,Scam susceptibility is associated with a markedly accelerated onset of Alzheimer's disease dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: The association of scam susceptibility with the timing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia onset is unknown.
METHODS: One thousand ninety-two older adults without dementia underwent assessments of scam susceptibility and annual clinical evaluations to document incident AD dementia. Accelerated failure time models examined the relation of scam susceptibility with dementia onset.
RESULTS: During a mean of 5 years of follow-up (standard deviation = 3.1), 188 individuals (17%) were diagnosed with incident AD dementia. A higher level of scam susceptibility was associated with a considerably earlier dementia onset ( β $\beta $   = -0.039; 95% confidence interval: -0.061, -0.017); those with a high level of susceptibility developed AD dementia at a mean age of 90.9 years compared to 98.2 for those with a low level. Results persisted after controlling for global cognition, sex, and education.
DISCUSSION: Scam susceptibility is associated with a markedly earlier onset of AD dementia. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of individuals at risk of developing dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: We examined whether scam susceptibility among older adults is associated with an accelerated onset of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Participants came from a large ongoing cohort study of aging. Scam susceptibility was assessed using a validated measure. Scam susceptibility was associated with a marked acceleration in dementia onset. Assessment of susceptibility may facilitate early identification of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40118895,A cytometric bead array for the measurement of plasma biomarker levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"Identifying plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered strong interest. In this study, a cytometric bead array (CBA) method for measuring the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) was evaluated. Fifty patients with cognitive impairment (CI) and 22 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls were recruited. CI patients were classified into Aβ + and Aβ - groups according to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan results. Biomarker levels in the plasma of all participants and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 28 CI patients were measured via CBA. Plasma P-tau181 levels were greatest in the Aβ + CI group and showed excellent performance in differentiating Aβ + CI patients from CU controls. The plasma and CSF levels of P-tau181 were correlated with each other and had similar diagnostic performance for distinguishing between Aβ + CI patients and Aβ- CI patients. Overall, CBA is a potential cost-effective method for measuring plasma biomarkers, particularly P-tau181, in AD patients.",Sci Rep,2025
40016783,Probing locus coeruleus functional network in healthy aging and its association with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers using pupillometry.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and the early detection of the disease-associated changes allows early interventions. The locus coeruleus (LC) has been reported to be the first brain region to develop tau pathology in AD. However, the functional brain network of the LC in both healthy aging and AD pathology is largely unknown due to technical difficulties associated with the small size of the LC. In this study, we used the measurement of spontaneous pupil constriction/dilation as a surrogate for LC activity to study LC brain network changes during healthy aging.
METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy younger and thirty-nine healthy older adults were included from the Emory Healthy Brain Study and underwent resting-state functional MRI while simultaneously tracking pupil diameter. The measurements of pupil diameter dynamics were used as reference signals in brain connectivity analysis. The connectivity of the identified networks was then compared between younger and older participants. Correlations of the identified regions with neuropsychological assessments and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were also evaluated.
RESULTS: A brain network of 20 clusters associated with pupil diameter dynamics was identified, including the LC as well as brain regions functionally connected to the LC. The pupil diameter network was found to positively correlate with the salience network and negatively correlate with the central executive network. Functional connectivity decreased within the pupil diameter network with healthy aging. The pupil diameter connectivity was associated with memory, executive, and visuospatial functioning. CSF total tau closely correlated with pupil diameter network.
CONCLUSIONS: Pupil diameter dynamics provide valuable insights into LC-related processes. While they are not solely influenced by LC activity, spontaneous pupil constrictor/dilatory activity shows promise as a non-invasive approach to probe the LC network and warrants further studies to evaluate its value as an early biomarker of AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39900257,Statin is associated with higher cortical thickness in early Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ, essential for myelination and neuronal function. Statins, widely used to lower cholesterol, cross the blood-brain barrier and may impact brain cholesterol synthesis. Despite their widespread use, the effects of statins on cortical regions relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not well understood. This study aimed to compare cortical thickness between statin-exposed and statin-unexposed older adults and evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of statins.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The sample included 193 healthy controls (HC), 485 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 169 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were categorized as statin users if they had used statins for at least two years. MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer software to estimate cortical thickness in 64 regions of interest. ANCOVA models assessed the association between statin use and cortical thickness at baseline, and linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes.
RESULTS: Statin use was associated with increased cortical thickness in multiple brain regions across HC, MCI, and AD participants. In HC, statin users had greater thickness in the right lateral occipital, left middle temporal, and left parahippocampal regions. MCI participants exhibited additional increases in the right cuneus, right posterior cingulate, and left superior temporal cortex. In AD, statin users had higher thickness in the right cuneus and right superior parietal lobule. Longitudinal analysis revealed no statin-related differences in cortical thickness changes among HC and AD groups, but in MCI, statins slowed cortical thinning in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex.
CONCLUSION: Statin use is associated with greater cortical thickness in older adults, particularly in those with MCI. These findings suggest that statins may have neuroprotective effects, potentially mitigating neurodegenerative changes in early cognitive decline. Further research with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods is needed to confirm these findings and understand the mechanisms involved.",Exp Gerontol,2025
39821948,Searching for responders to multidomain dementia prevention in late life: A pooled analysis of individual participant data from the MAPT and preDIVA trials.,"INTRODUCTION: It is unknown in which, if any, subgroups of older adults multidomain interventions are effective at reducing long-term dementia incidence.
METHODS: We pooled up to 12 years of follow-up data from 5205 participants aged > 70 from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) and Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (preDIVA) studies. The primary outcome was incident all-cause dementia. Pre-specified subgroups were defined by dementia risk factors (age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype, cognitive status, and cardiovascular risk factors).
RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-six participants developed dementia during 37,782 person-years of follow-up. Higher incidence was associated with baseline age, APOE ε4 genotype, physical inactivity, Mini-Mental State Examination, and blood pressure. Multidomain intervention had no effect on incident dementia overall (hazard ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.80-1.21), or in any pre-specified subgroup. A recursive partitioning algorithm also did not detect any subgroups, defined by single or multiple risk factors, showing a differential intervention effect.
DISCUSSION: We did not identify any subgroups of older adults in whom multidomain interventions significantly reduced incident dementia.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: MAPT: NCT00672685 (clinicaltrials.gov); PreDIVA: ISRCTN29711771 (ISRCTN registry) HIGHLIGHTS: We pooled up to 12 years of follow-up data from two multidomain prevention trials. Five thousand two hundred five participants aged ≥ 70 were included. Subgroups were pre-defined by modifiable and non-modifiable dementia risk factors. A data-driven recursive partitioning algorithm was also used. Multidomain intervention did not lower incident dementia overall or in any subgroup.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

40012862,Study insights in the role of PGC-1α in neurological diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which is highly expressed in the central nervous system, is known to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biosynthesis, metabolic regulation, neuroinflammation, autophagy, and oxidative stress. This knowledge indicates a potential role of PGC-1α in a wide range of functions associated with neurological diseases. There is emerging evidence indicating a protective role of PGC-1α in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. As such, a deeper and broader understanding of PGC-1α and its role in neurological diseases is urgently needed. The present review provides a relatively complete overview of the current knowledge on PGC-1α, including its functions in different types of neurons, basic structural characteristics, and its interacting transcription factors. Furthermore, we present the role of PGC-1α in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other PolyQ diseases. Importantly, we discuss some compounds or drug-targeting strategies that have been studied to ameliorate the pathology of these neurological diseases and introduce the possible mechanistic pathways. Based on the available studies, we propose that targeting PGC-1α could serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for one or more neurological diseases.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39865687,Digital detector PET/CT increases Centiloid measures of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease: A head-to-head comparison of cameras.,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease has led to increased interest in precisely quantifying amyloid-β (Aβ) burden for diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and further clinical research. Recent positron emission tomography (PET) hardware innovations including digital detectors have led to superior resolution and sensitivity, improving quantitative accuracy. However, the effect of PET scanner on Centiloid remains relatively unexplored and is assumed to be minimized by harmonizing PET resolutions.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the differences in Centiloid between scanners in a paired cohort.
METHODS: 36 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle study (AIBL) cohort were scanned within a year on two scanners. Each participant underwent <sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694 imaging on two of the three scanners investigated, the Siemens Vision, the Siemens mCT and the Philips Gemini. We compared Aβ Centiloid quantification between scanners and assessed the effectiveness of post-reconstruction PET resolution harmonization. We further compared the scanner differences in target sub-regions and with different reference regions to assess spatial variability.
RESULTS: Centiloid from the Vision camera was found to be significantly higher compared to the Gemini and mCT; the difference was greater at high-Centiloid levels. Post-reconstruction resolution harmonization only accounted for and corrected ∼20% of the Centiloid (CL) difference between scanners. We further demonstrated that residual differences have effects that vary spatially between different subregions of the Centiloid mask.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the type of PET scanner that a participant is scanned on affects Centiloid quantification, even when scanner resolution is harmonized. We conclude by highlighting the need for further investigation into harmonization techniques that consider scanner differences.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39776253,The etiology and prevention of early-stage tau pathology in higher cortical circuits: Insights from aging rhesus macaques.,"Aging rhesus macaques provide a unique model for learning how age and inflammation drive early-stage pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and for testing potential therapeutics. Unlike mice, aging macaques have extensive association cortices and inflammatory signaling similar to humans, are apolipoprotein E ε4 homozygotes, and naturally develop tau and amyloid pathology with marked cognitive deficits. Importantly, monkeys provide the unique opportunity to study early-stage, soluble hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), including p-tau217. As soluble p-tau is rapidly dephosphorylated post mortem, it is not captured in human brains except with biopsy material. However, new macaque data show that soluble p-tau is toxic to neurons and capable of seeding across cortical circuits. Extensive evidence indicates that age-related inflammatory signaling contributes to calcium dysregulation, which drives tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid beta generation. Pharmacological studies in aged macaques suggest that inhibiting inflammation and restoring calcium regulation can reduce tau hyperphosphorylation with minimal side effects, appropriate for potential preventive therapeutics. HIGHLIGHTS: Aging monkeys provide a unique window into early stage, soluble phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Inflammation with advancing age leads to calcium dysregulation, p-tau, and amyloid beta (Aβ). Macaque research shows p-tau undergoes transsynaptic seeding early in the cortex. p-tau traps amyloid precursor protein-containing endosomes, which may increase Aβ and drive vicious cycles. Restoring calcium regulation in cortex reduced p-tau217 levels in aged macaques.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40042435,Considerations in the clinical use of amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are now established tools in the diagnostic workup of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their use is anticipated to increase with the introduction of new disease-modifying therapies. Although these biomarkers are comparable alternatives in research settings to determine Aβ status, biomarker testing in clinical practice requires careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of each modality, as well as the specific clinical context, to identify which test is best suited for each patient. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathologic processes reflected by Aβ-PET and CSF biomarkers, their performance, and their current and future applications and contexts of use. The primary aim is to assist clinicians in making better-informed decisions about the suitability of each biomarker in different clinical situations, thereby reducing the risk of misdiagnosis or incorrect interpretation of biomarker results. HIGHLIGHTS: Recent advances have positioned Aβ PET and CSF biomarkers as pivotal in AD diagnosis. It is crucial to understand the differences in the clinical use of these biomarkers. A team of experts reviewed the state of Aβ PET and CSF markers in clinical settings. Differential features in the clinical application of these biomarkers were reviewed. We discussed the role of Aβ PET and CSF in the context of novel plasma biomarkers.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39956948,In silico study of selected alkaloids as dual inhibitors of β- and γ-secretases for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become common as the number of aged people increases making it as a socioeconomic problem lately. To date, no success is recorded for disease-modifying therapies for AD but only drugs for symptomatic relief exist. Research has been centered on the role of amyloid-β on the pathogenesis of AD, which has led to the development of drugs that target Aβ (β- and γ-secretase inhibitors) to reduce the amount of Aβ formed. However, the existing β and γ-secretase inhibitors were associated with harmful side effects, low efficacy, and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
OBJECTIVE: This study therefore used in silico approach to predict the inhibitory properties of alkaloids as potential drug targets against AD.
METHODS: Thus, in this current study, 54 alkaloids from the PhytoHub server (phytohub.eu), and two approved drugs were docked against β-secretases. Additionally, galantamine and 5 alkaloids with the utmost binding potential with β-secretase were subjected to pharmacokinetics evaluation and docked against γ-secretase.
RESULTS: From the result, 5 compounds displayed for both docking periods, with demissidine, solasodine, tomatidine, and solanidine having better BE than the control drugs. Based on the pharmacokinetics evaluation, 4 compounds possessed good pharmacokinetic evaluation and biological activities than galantamine.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that demissidine, solasodine, tomatidine, and solanidine are promising dual inhibitors against β- and γ-secretase proteins in silico. However, there is an urgent need to carry out in vitro and in vivo experiments on these new leads to validate the findings of this study.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39820599,CohortDiagnostics: Phenotype evaluation across a network of observational data sources using population-level characterization.,"OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating phenotype algorithms (PAs) using the open-source tool, Cohort Diagnostics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method is based on several diagnostic criteria to evaluate a patient cohort returned by a PA. Diagnostics include estimates of incidence rate, index date entry code breakdown, and prevalence of all observed clinical events prior to, on, and after index date. We test our framework by evaluating one PA for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and two PAs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) across 10 different observational data sources.
RESULTS: By utilizing CohortDiagnostics, we found that the population-level characteristics of individuals in the cohort of SLE closely matched the disease's anticipated clinical profile. Specifically, the incidence rate of SLE was consistently higher in occurrence among females. Moreover, expected clinical events like laboratory tests, treatments, and repeated diagnoses were also observed. For AD, although one PA identified considerably fewer patients, absence of notable differences in clinical characteristics between the two cohorts suggested similar specificity.
DISCUSSION: We provide a practical and data-driven approach to evaluate PAs, using two clinical diseases as examples, across a network of OMOP data sources. Cohort Diagnostics can ensure the subjects identified by a specific PA align with those intended for inclusion in a research study.
CONCLUSION: Diagnostics based on large-scale population-level characterization can offer insights into the misclassification errors of PAs.",PLoS One,2025
39979805,Interaction of genetic variants and methylation in transcript-level expression regulation in Alzheimer's disease by multi-omics data analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant public health problem and major cause of dementia. Not only genetic but epigenetic factors contribute to complex and heterogeneous molecular mechanisms underlying AD risk; in particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation can lead to dysregulation of gene expression in the AD brain. Each of these regulators has been independently studied well in AD progression, however, their interactive roles, particularly when they are located differently, still remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the interplay between SNPs and DNA methylation in regulating transcript expression levels in the AD brain through an integrative analysis of whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and methylation data measured from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
RESULTS: We identified 179 SNP-methylation combination pairs that showed statistically significant interactions associated with the expression of 67 transcripts (63 unique genes), enriched in functional pathways, including immune-related and post-synaptic assembly pathways. Particularly, a number of HLA family genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-K, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DMA) were observed as having expression changes associated with the interplay.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings especially implicate immune-related pathways as targets of these regulatory interactions. SNP-methylation interactions may thus contribute to the molecular complexity underlying immune-related pathogenies in AD patients. Our study provides a new molecular knowledge in the context of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic regulations, in that it concerns transcript expression status in AD.",BMC Genomics,2025
40002537,The Endothelial Cell-Related Genes EIF1 and HSPA1B Contribute to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease by Modulating Peripheral Immunoinflammatory Responses.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immunoinflammatory responses contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and endothelial cells (ECs) are involved in these responses. Nevertheless, the potential molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which ECs modulate peripheral immunoinflammatory responses and thus contribute to AD pathogenesis are not fully understood.
METHODS: The single-cell RNA sequencing dataset GSE157827 was analyzed, and AD key genes were screened using LASSO regression and random forest algorithms. Functional enrichment analyses of these AD key genes were conducted using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis. Immune cell infiltration analyses for AD key genes were performed using single-sample GSEA, and their correlations with immunoinflammatory factors were assessed using the TISIDB database. Peripheral blood RNA sequencing data from our cohort were utilized to validate the expression patterns of EC-related AD key genes in peripheral blood and to investigate their association with cognition.
RESULTS: ECs are the most significant contributors to AD among all brain cell subpopulations. For the first time, the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B were identified as key genes associated with AD progression. These two EC-related key genes may participate in AD pathogenesis by modulating peripheral immunoinflammatory responses. The levels of EIF1 and HSPA1B were significantly altered in the peripheral blood during AD progression, and EIF1 levels correlated with cognitive functions in AD clinical continuum patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the critical roles of the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B in AD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for this disease.",Brain Sci,2025
40042470,Exploring epidemiological risk factors for cerebral amyloid angiopathy: Considerations for monoclonal antibody therapy in people with Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) increases the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients receiving anti-amyloid-beta therapies, emphasizing the need to identify its risk factors.
METHODS: Data were collected from three cohort studies, and a machine learning model was developed to predict CAA occurrence using the selected risk factors.
RESULTS: The AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC)-CAA association was significantly positive in the cross-sectional analysis. When stratified by selected risk factors, this association was generally stronger among females, smokers, people with a history of stroke/memory complaints, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 carriers, and those without diabetes/heart conditions. In the longitudinal analysis of the association between potential risk factors and CAA, a higher risk of CAA was observed among males, older individuals, smokers, people with diabetes/heart conditions, lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and APOE-ε4 carriers compared to their respective reference groups.
DISCUSSION: Our study identified risk factors for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, informing potential prevention strategies.
HIGHLIGHTS: ADNC were significantly positively associated with the risk of CAA. The ADNC-CAA association was generally stronger among females, smokers, people with a history of stroke/memory complaints, APOE-ε4 carriers, and those without diabetes or heart conditions. Longitudinally, higher CAA risk was observed among males, older individuals, smokers, people with diabetes/heart conditions/lower MMSE scores, and APOE-ε4 carriers compared to their reference groups.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40087766,Beyond expectations: investigating nilotinib's potential in attenuating neurodegeneration in alzheimer's disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose a formidable global challenge. While therapeutic options are available, their limitations are significant, necessitating the development of innovative treatment approaches. Here, we highlight the importance of repurposing drugs and discuss the future of drug treatments for AD. We review the potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for mitigating AD pathology and symptoms, as well as neurodegenerative processes more broadly. We focus on nilotinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has unique mechanisms of action involving the modulation of cell responses and removal of toxic proteins associated with AD pathogenesis. Encouraging studies have demonstrated its efficacy, calling for further investigation through clinical trials to assess its potential in various neurodegenerative conditions. However, despite these promising preclinical findings, no clinical studies have yet conclusively demonstrated its efficacy in treating AD. Considering the future directions in AD research, personalized medicine approaches hold promise by incorporating patient-specific factors, including sex and gender differences, to tailor nilotinib treatment for improved efficacy and safety profiles.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40145328,Decreased water exchange rate across the blood-brain barrier throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum: Evidence from Chinese data.,"INTRODUCTION: Water exchange rate (Kw) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to evaluate BBB functionality. Variations in BBB Kw across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum remain uncertain.
METHODS: The study encompassed 38 cognitively normal individuals without AD biomarkers (CN_A-), 30 cognitively normal (CN_A+), and 31 cognitively impaired individuals (CI_A+) with positive AD biomarkers. Participants underwent clinical assessments, MRI/positron emission tomography scans, and assays of plasma biomarkers.
RESULTS: Significantly lower Kw was observed in multiple brain regions throughout the AD continuum. This alteration in Kw correlated with plasma biomarkers and neuropsychological performance. Elevated levels of phosphorylated tau 217 intensified the inverse relationship between Kw and neuropsychological performance. The integration of Kw, brain volume, and plasma biomarkers demonstrated potential in distinguishing stages within the AD continuum.
DISCUSSION: Consistently lower Kw was evident across the AD continuum and may act as a diagnostic tool for early AD screening.
HIGHLIGHTS: Observations revealed a decline in water exchange rate (Kw) across multiple brain regions within the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, notably in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and deep brain nuclei during the preclinical stage of AD. Strong correlations were established between Kw levels in various brain regions and plasma biomarkers, as well as neuropsychological performance in the AD continuum. Interaction between plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and Kw in the hippocampus was linked to executive function, indicating a combined detrimental impact on cognitive abilities stemming from both blood-brain barrier Kw and p-tau 217. The combined use of Kw, brain volume, and plasma biomarkers-neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein-demonstrated potential for distinguishing individuals within the AD continuum.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39763384,Cerebral perfusion alterations in healthy young adults due to two genetic risk factors of Alzheimer's disease: APOE and MAPT.,"Functional brain changes such as altered cerebral blood flow occur long before the onset of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. While cerebral hypoperfusion occurs in established AD, middle-aged carriers of genetic risk factors for AD, including APOE ε4, display regional hyperperfusion due to hypothesised pleiotropic or compensatory effects, representing a possible early biomarker of AD and facilitating earlier AD diagnosis. However, it is not clear whether hyperperfusion already exists even earlier in life. Here, 160 young and cognitively healthy participants from the Chinese PREVENT cohort underwent 3 T arterial spin labelling and T1 MRI and genetic testing for APOE and MAPT rs242557 status. Using FSL, we performed a whole brain voxel-wise analysis and a global mean grey matter analysis comparing for the effects of both risk genes on cerebral perfusion. No significant alterations were seen for APOE genotype, but in MAPT rs242557 A carriers, we observed a significantly hyperperfusion in the left anterior cingulate cortex and left insular cortex. There were no effects of APOE or MAPT status on the global perfusion. These results are novel and may suggest that MAPT genotypes demonstrated a distinct hemodynamic profile in a very young age.",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,2025
40142629,Apathy in Dementia: A Pilot Study Providing Insights from Neuropsychiatric and Radiological Perspectives.,"Background: Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in all stages of dementia, significantly complicating patient management. This study examines the prevalence of apathy across Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Vascular Dementia (VD) and explores its associations with cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 200 patients diagnosed with AD, LBD, FTD, and VD along with 100 healthy controls (HCs). Apathy was assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Depression and anxiety in patients were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Scale, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). MRI findings were evaluated using atrophy scales that are routinely utilized in dementia assessments. Results: Apathy was significantly more prevalent in dementia and MCI patients compared to HC. However, there were no significant differences in apathy prevalence among dementia subtypes. Apathy showed no significant correlation with depression, anxiety, or cognitive performance. Notably, MRI analysis revealed a strong association between apathy and orbitofrontal (OF) sulci atrophy. Conclusions: Apathy is a critical symptom in dementia, linked to OF atrophy and presenting challenges in management. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating apathy assessments in clinical practice. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify the pathophysiology and management of apathy in dementia.",J Clin Med,2025
39686621,"Conformation pattern changes in R1-pS262 tau peptide induced endogenous tau aggregation, synaptic damage, and cognitive impairments.","BACKGROUND: To date, the effect of tau phosphorylation at different amino acid sites on the conformation and function of tau is still unclear in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Protein fingerprinting, also known as the protein folding shape code (PFSC) method, is a protein structure prediction technique based on protein sequence, which can reveal proteins' most likely spatial conformation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of phosphorylation on tau protein conformation using PFSC technology and further analyze the differences in the effect of phosphorylation on tau aggregation at specific sites.
METHODS: We performed a conformational analysis of wild-type and simulated mutant hTau441 using the PFSC method and synthesized the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau fragments by the chemical solid phase method.
RESULTS: We found that the number of Ser262 protein fingerprints increased from six in tau S262A to nine in tau S262E, together with increased conformational changes and enhanced flexibility. The in vitro Thioflavin S assay showed that phosphorylated tau fragments R1-pS262 possessed a stronger activity of inducing tau aggregation. In contrast to the non-phosphorylated tau fragment R1-nS262, R1-pS262 promoted endogenous tau aggregation and decreased synaptic proteins. In rats, R1-pS262 caused cognitive impairments and neuronal loss in addition to endogenous tau aggregation and synaptic damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study firstly reports that tau phosphorylation at Ser262 induces tau aggregation, and phosphorylated tau fragments R1-pS262 directly result in neuropathological changes. These provide new clues to the pathogenesis of tauopathy, such as AD, and a new molecular target for possible intervention.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40193795,Automatic Mild Intracranial Stenosis Detection in the Circle of Willis from Time-of-Flight MRA (S2.007).,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an automatic method for detecting mild intracranial stenosis in the Cirlce of Willis from Time-of-Flight MRA (TOF-MRA).
BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic mild intracranial stenosis (MIS) is defined as 20-50% narrowing of brain arteries, including those in the Circle of Willis (CW). Recent studies show that MIS increases the risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and accelerates brain atrophy. However, MIS is often underdiagnosed in clinical settings, leading to missed opportunities for early intervention that could delay cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Current software-based detection methods have limited sensitivity in detecting MIS, partly due to challenges in reconstructing tortuous arterial segments (e.g., kissing vessels).
DESIGN/METHODS: We tested our approach using 1.5T TOF-MRA images from the NOMAS dataset, comprising 1052 participants aged 62 to 80 years, with 1157 MIS cases manually identified in anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs), internal carotid arteries (ICAs), middle cerebral arteries (MCAs), and posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) by a vascular neurologist. Intracranial arteries were automatically segmented, and kissing vessel artifacts were addressed using in-house algorithms. Arterial diameters were measured along the centerline extracted from a 3D surface method. We calculated stenosis ratios by comparing these measurements to distal (Metric 1), proximal (Metric 2), and average diameters (Metric 3) of each artery. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of MIS cases evaluated by the neurologist that had a stenosis ratio of 20-50% from our method.
RESULTS: Metric 3 achieved the highest accuracy (89.6%), significantly outperforming Metric 1 (51%) and Metric 2 (46%). Metric 1 performed best in ACAs (92.5%), followed by ICAs (89%), PCAs (88.5%), and MCAs (85.7%). The method effectively addressed kissing vessels in 180 out of 192 ICAs, enhancing stenosis detection accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method effectively detects MIS, particularly in the CW anterior circulation, by incorporating our approach to kissing vessels and average arterial diameters in stenosis ratio calculations.

39975470,Characterization of plasma AT(N) biomarkers among a racial and ethnically diverse community-based cohort: an HABS-HD study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers of Amyloid(A), Tau(T), and Neurodegeneration(N) have been increasingly studied to fill the gap in our understanding of racial and ethnic differences. This study aimed to examine the relationship between plasma AT(N) biomarkers and (1) AT(N) neuroimaging biomarkers, (2) demographics, (3) medical comorbidities, and (4) cognitive diagnosis.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from n = 764 non-Hispanic Black (NHB), n = 1230 Hispanic, and n = 1232 non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants. Plasma AT(N) biomarkers were derived using single molecule array (SIMOA) technology on an HD-X imager and included amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40, total tau, ptau181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Clinical reads of positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid and tau positivity were used to examine the link between AT(N) plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers. Generalized linear models were conducted to examine the relationship between plasma AT(N) biomarkers and select demographic, diagnostic, and medical comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease).
RESULTS: Differences in the AT(N) biomarkers were found across racial/ethnic groups. Plasma Aβ42/40 was found to be associated with PET amyloid positivity only among NHW participants, while plasma NfL was found to correlate with Meta-ROI among NHB and Hispanic participants. Ptau181 was associated with PET amyloid positivity among NHB and NHW participants and well as PET tau positivity among the latter group and Hispanic participants. Diabetes was related to increased plasma AT(N) biomarkers among NHB and Hispanic participants. CKD was associated with increased AT(N) biomarkers for all race/ethnic groups with the exception of Aβ42/40. While Aβ42/40, total tau, ptau181, and NfL were found to be related to a dementia diagnosis among NHW participants, only ptau181 and NfL were found to be related to this same diagnostic category among NHB and Hispanic participants.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate differential relationships between comorbidities (demographic, medical, diagnostic) across NHB, Hispanic, and NHW participants. This work expands our knowledge regarding the associations of plasma biomarkers to AD pathology in diverse populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Differences in AT(N) plasma biomarkers were found in a diverse community cohort.While plasma Aβ42/40 was associated with PET amyloid positivity among non-Hispanic white participants, this did not apply to non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic participants.Medical comorbidity of diabetes and chronic kidney disease was related to increased plasma AT(N) biomarkers among the ethnically diverse segment of the cohort.Plasma AT(N) biomarkers were more so related to a diagnosis of dementia for non-Hispanic white as compared to Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black participants.Across racial/ethnic groups, the plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration (NfL) and ptau181 were related to a diagnosis of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39775480,Importance of Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Circadian Disruption-Associated Biomarkers in Emergence of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major devastating neurodegenerative disorder afflicting majorly the geriatric population. Emerging studies augur the connection of gut dysbiosis and circadian disruption with the early onset of AD. Gut dysbiosis is characterized by dysregulated gut microbiota signature and compromised intestinal integrity, which provokes the translocation of bacterial metabolites into the systemic circulation. Noteworthy, gut-derived metabolites like calprotectin, trimethylamine-N-oxide, kynurenine, isoamylamine, and short-chain fatty acids play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Circadian dysregulation also corresponds with the exacerbated AD pathogenesis by accumulating Aβ and tau proteins. Moreover, circadian dysregulation is one of the causative factors for gut dysbiosis. This review discusses the complex interplay between the microbiota-gut-brain axis, circadian rhythmicity, and the emergence of AD. We reviewed preclinical and clinical studies on AD describing potential biomarkers of gut dysbiosis and circadian dysregulation. The identification of new biomarkers associated with the microbiota-gut-brain axis and circadian rhythmicity may help in early diagnosis and development of targeted therapies for mitigating neurodegenerative AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39995657,"Neuronal and glial dysfunction, white matter hyperintensities and cognition in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.","This cross-sectional study examined associations between multiple fluid biomarkers of neuronal and glial dysfunction (plasma neurofilament light chain, CSF growth-associated protein 43 and CSF soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), total white matter hyperintensity volume and episodic memory and executive function performance in the context of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status. A total of 563 participants (mean age = 71.9 years, standard deviation = 7.2) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were classified by the amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration framework into no Alzheimer's disease pathology (n = 176), suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (n = 87) or Alzheimer's disease continuum (n = 300) groups. Participants completed baseline neuropsychological assessment, plasma/CSF biomarker collection and MRI. Analyses explored the relative contributions of biomarkers to episodic memory and executive function performance and whether relationships varied by amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration group status. Across all participants, neurofilament light chain (  β ^   = -0.14, P &lt; 0.001) and growth-associated protein 43 (  β ^   = -0.13, P &lt; 0.001) were the strongest biomarkers associated with episodic memory performance, such that greater levels were associated with worse episodic memory. There was a group by growth-associated protein 43 interaction with episodic memory: greater growth-associated protein 43 was associated with lower episodic memory performance in participants classified as Alzheimer's disease continuum relative to the no Alzheimer's disease pathology group (  β ^   = -0.26, P &lt; 0.001). No robust associations between biomarkers and executive function performance or between soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, white matter hyperintensity volume and cognition were observed. Biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury and synaptic dysfunction may independently contribute to episodic memory performance across participants with differing amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration profiles. Growth-associated protein 43 may predict worse episodic memory performance in participants with greater Alzheimer's disease pathology. These biomarkers of neuronal dysfunction may serve as domain-specific cognitive correlates in the context of Alzheimer's disease biomarker status.",Brain Commun,2025

AIMS: Retromer complex with Vacuolar Protein Sorting-35 (VPS35) as the core plays an important role in the transport of biological proteins and has been confirmed to be closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. This study was designed to determine whether VPS35 could affect the trafficking mechanism of M1AChRs.
METHOD: The interaction between VPS35 and M1AChR was studied by co-immunoprecipitation method, and the recycling of M1AChR influence by VPS35 was analyzed using biotinylation technology.
RESULTS: It was found that VPS35 affected the localization of M1AChR on the cell membrane by regulating intracellular M1AChR transport, thus controlling the M1AChR-mediated cholinergic signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: The findings presented here provide a potential pathogenesis and pathway for the treatment of AD.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
40084922,Regional Brain Metabolism across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum in Down Syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).
METHODS: We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.
RESULTS: In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.
INTERPRETATION: The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol,2025
39740107,Facing the new diagnostic and treatment options of Alzheimer's disease: The necessity of informed consent.,"With advances in biomarker-based detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and new treatment options with disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), we are heading toward a new conceptualization of diagnostics and therapy in the early stages of AD. Yet consensus guidelines on best clinical practices in predictive AD diagnostics are still developing. Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding counseling and disclosure practices in early symptomatic disease stages, its implications for dementia risk estimation, and DMTs with associated risks and benefits. The crucial feature is the capacity of patients with (mild) cognitive impairment, eligible for DMTs, to consent. This perspective aims to (1) discuss the current challenges in assessing capacity to consent and (2) highlight the importance of a supported (informed) decision-making process. Measures to facilitate informed decision-making of patients constitute an ethical approach to enhancing the quality of care in this evolving therapeutic landscape. HIGHLIGHTS: This perspective: Explores biomarker-based early symptomatic AD detection and the implications for patient care. Emphasizes supported decision-making in DMTs for MCI and dementia patients. Discusses the need for standardized tools to assess the capacity to consent. Aligns diagnostic and treatment approaches with ethical care standards. Enhances patient autonomy in the evolving AD therapeutic landscape.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39894910,"Microglial polarization in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanisms, implications, and therapeutic opportunities.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation. Microglial cells, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. Microglia can undergo polarization, shifting between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes in response to different stimuli. Dysregulation of microglial polarization towards the pro-inflammatory phenotype leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction. These processes contribute to neuronal damage and cognitive decline in AD. However, several challenges remain in this field. The complex molecular mechanisms governing microglial polarization in AD need to be further elucidated. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying microglial polarization in AD and its implications in disease progression.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39953602,Circular RNA APP contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by modulating microglial polarization via miR-1906/CLIC1 axis.,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal microglial polarization phenotypes contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered increasing attention due to their significant roles in human diseases. Although research has demonstrated differential expression of circRNAs in AD, their specific functions in AD pathogenesis remain largely unexplored.
METHODS: CircRNA microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and WT mice. The stability of circAPP was assessed via RNase R treatment assay. CircAPP downstream targets miR-1906 and chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) were identified using bioinformatics and proteomics, respectively. RT-PCR assay was conducted to detect the expression of circAPP, miR-1906 and CLIC1. Morris water maze (MWM) test, passive avoidance test and novel object recognition task were used to detect cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice. Microglial M1/M2 polarization and AD pathology were assessed using Western blot, flow cytometry and Golgi staining assays. CLIC1 expression and channel activity were evaluated using Western blot and functional chloride channel assays, respectively. The subcellular location of circAPP was assessed via FISH and RT-PCR assays. RNA pull-down assay was performed to detect the interaction of miR-1906 with circAPP and 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of CLIC1 mRNA.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a novel circRNA, named circAPP, that is encoded by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is implicated in AD. CircAPP is a stable circRNA that was upregulated in Aβ-treated microglial cells and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Downregulation of circAPP or CLIC1, or overexpression of miR-1906 in microglia modulated microglial M1/M2 polarization in Aβ-treated microglial cells and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, and improved AD pathology and the cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice. Further results revealed that circAPP was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, and circAPP could regulate CLIC1 expression and channel activity by interacting with miR-1906 and affecting miR-1906 expression, thereby regulating microglial polarization in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study elucidates the regulatory role of circAPP in AD microglial polarization via miR-1906/CLIC1 axis, and suggests that circAPP may act as a critical player in AD pathogenesis and represent a promising therapeutic target for AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39868572,Association of rapid eye movement sleep latency with multimodal biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep disturbances are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), but the relationship between sleep architecture, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and AD/ADRD biomarkers remains unclear.
METHODS: We enrolled 128 adults (64 with Alzheimer's disease, 41 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 23 with normal cognition [NC]), mean age 70.8 ± 9.6 years, 56.9% female, from a tertiary hospital in China. Participants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG), amyloid β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma biomarker analysis: phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
RESULTS: After adjusting for demographics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status, cognition, and comorbidities, the highest tertile of REM latency was associated with higher Aβ burden (β = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03 to 0.13, p = 0.002), elevated p-tau181 (β = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.13, p = 0.002), and reduced BDNF levels (β = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.13, p = 0.013), compared to the lowest tertile.
DISCUSSION: Prolonged REM latency may serve as a novel marker or risk factor for AD/ADRD pathogenesis.
HIGHLIGHTS: Rapid eye movement latency (REML) may be a potential marker for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) pathogenesis. Prolonged REML was associated with higher amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181), and lower brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Intervention trial is needed to determine if targeting REML can modify AD/ADRD risk. Slow-wave sleep was not associated with AD/ADRD biomarkers.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40133250,Blood DNA methylation signature for incident dementia: Evidence from longitudinal cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Distinguishing between molecular changes that precede dementia onset and those resulting from the disease is challenging with cross-sectional studies.
METHODS: We studied blood DNA methylation (DNAm) differences and incident dementia in two large longitudinal cohorts: the Offspring cohort of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We analyzed blood DNAm samples from > 1000 cognitively unimpaired subjects.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis identified 44 CpGs and 44 differentially methylated regions consistently associated with time to dementia in both cohorts. Our integrative analysis identified early processes in dementia, such as immune responses and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we developed a methylation-based risk score, which successfully predicted future cognitive decline in an independent validation set, even after accounting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score.
DISCUSSION: DNAm offers a promising source as a biomarker for dementia risk assessment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood DNA methylation (DNAm) differences at individual CpGs and differentially methylated regions are significantly associated with incident dementia. Pathway analysis revealed DNAm differences associated with incident dementia are significantly enriched in biological pathways involved in immune responses and metabolic processes. Out-of-sample validation analysis demonstrated that a methylation-based risk score successfully predicted future cognitive decline in an independent dataset, even after accounting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40116682,V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 as a potential predictor of Alzheimer's disease and advanced aging.,"BackgroundV-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4) emerges as a significant player in the immune system pathways. It has been previously identified as a potential hub gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging, underscoring its importance in understanding these conditions.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of serum VSIG4 and identify trends in serum VSIG4 in relationship with other biomarkers and neurological tests.MethodsELISA was used to measure the serum concentration of VSIG4 in AD, compared to healthy subjects. The relationship between VSIG4 levels and the age of the subjects, as well as other AD-related serum proteins and various measures of cognition was examined.ResultsVSIG4 was significantly elevated in the serum of AD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0074). Significant correlations were identified between serum VSIG4 and other notable proteins related to AD and inflammation, such as total tau, neurofilament light (NfL), YKL-40, CD14, FABP3, and TNF-α. Significant correlations were also identified between VSIG4 concentration and the results of neurological tests.ConclusionsSerum VSIG4 may reflect neuroinflammation and altered lipid processing, affecting the cognitive performance of AD and aging.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39983802,The causal relationship of inflammation-related factors with osteoporosis: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to examine whether genetically determined inflammation-related risk factors play a role in the onset of osteoporosis (OP) in the European population.
METHODS: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) summary statistics of estimated bone mineral density (eBMD) obtained from the public database GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis Consortium (GEFOS) including 142,487 European people. For exposures, we utilized GWAS data of 9 risk factors including diseases chronic kidney disease (CKD) (41,395 cases and 439,303 controls), type 2 diabetes (T2D) (88,427 cases and 566,778 controls), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls) and major depression disorder (MDD) (9240 cases and 9519 controls) and lifestyle behaviors are from different consortiums. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis was principal method in this study and random effect model was applied; MR-Egger method and weighted median method were also performed for reliable results. Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger regression were used to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy and leave-one-out analysis was performed to find out whether there are influential SNPs.
RESULTS: We found that T2D (IVW: β = 0.05, P = 0.0014), FI (IVW: β = -0.22, P < 0.001), CKD (IVW: β = 0.02, P = 0.009), ALZ (IVW: β = 0.06, P = 0.005), Coffee consumption (IVW: β = 0.11, P = 0.003) were causally associated with OP (P<0.006after Bonferroni correction).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that T2D, FI, CKD, ALZ and coffee consumption are causally associated with OP. Future interventions targeting factors above could provide new clinical strategies for the personalized prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.",Exp Gerontol,2025
40133753,Advancements in Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras for Targeted Therapeutic Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The presence of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins, which mislocalize and form neurofibrillary tangles, and the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These toxic protein aggregates contribute to synaptic impairment and neuronal dysfunction, underscoring the need for strategies aimed at effectively clearing or reducing these aggregates in the treatment of AD. In recent years, proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has emerged as a promising approach for selectively degrading dysfunctional proteins rather than merely inhibiting their function. This approach holds great potential for developing more effective interventions that could slow AD progression and improve patient outcomes. In this review, we first examine the pathological mechanisms underlying AD, focusing on abnormal protein degradation and accumulation. We then explore the evolution of PROTAC technology, its mechanisms of action, and the current status of drug development. Finally, we discuss the latest findings regarding the application of PROTACs in AD therapy, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of this technology. Although promising, further clinical research is necessary to fully assess the safety and efficacy of PROTAC-based therapies for AD treatment.",Mol Neurobiol,2025

These issues can be addressed by the IMplementation Framework fOr Behavioral and LIfestyLe Interventions In AlZheimer's DiseasE (MOBILIZE), which was developed to guide the design and implementation of behavioral interventions in AD. Building on the person-centered principle, MOBILIZE includes three implementation outcomes with corresponding team processes: (1) screening (processes), (2) intervention adherence (processes), and (3) safety (processes). This study systematically evaluated MOBILIZE implementation outcomes of the 3-site aerobic exercise and cognitive training (ACT) Trial (recruitment started on 4/1/2018 and last follow-up on 7/17/2024). Outcomes included time in screening phases, intervention adherence (attendance and intervention dose adherence, and safety [adverse events]). Sample (n = 146) was 73.8 ± 5.7 years in age and 23.4 ± 2.1 on Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with 48.0% female and 91.8% White. The median days of screening-to-enrollment averaged 98 days. Attendance was 76.7 ± 28.6%. Adherence to 100% exercise session dose and 100% cognitive session dose was 71.7 ± 30.8% and 51.5 ± 26.2%, respectively. There were 10 study-related adverse events.

39719687,"Microglial Depletion, a New Tool in Neuroinflammatory Disorders: Comparison of Pharmacological Inhibitors of the CSF-1R.","A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, and their pro-inflammatory activation in the onset of many neurological diseases. Microglial proliferation, differentiation, and survival are highly dependent on the CSF-1 signaling pathway, which can be pharmacologically modulated by inhibiting its receptor, CSF-1R. Pharmacological inhibition of CSF-1R leads to an almost complete microglial depletion whereas treatment arrest allows for subsequent repopulation. Microglial depletion has shown promising results in many animal models of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis) where transitory microglial depletion reduced neuroinflammation and improved behavioral test results. In this review, we will focus on the comparison of three different pharmacological CSF-1R inhibitors (PLX3397, PLX5622, and GW2580) regarding microglial depletion. We will also highlight the promising results obtained by microglial depletion strategies in adult models of neurological disorders and argue they could also prove promising in neurodevelopmental diseases associated with microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Finally, we will discuss the lack of knowledge about the effects of these strategies on neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in adults and during neurodevelopment.",Glia,2025
40183406,Alzheimer's disease-related cortical proteins modify the association of brain insulin signaling with cognitive decline.,"BackgroundBrain insulin signaling has been associated with both Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and cognitive decline, but the mechanisms remain unclear.ObjectiveTo examine whether AD-related cortically-expressed proteins modify the association of brain insulin signaling and cognitive decline.MethodsParticipants included 116 autopsied members of the Religious Orders Study (58 with diabetes matched to 58 without, by age at death, sex, and education) who had both postmortem brain (prefrontal cortex) insulin signaling (by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, including RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase or AKT1) and AD-related cortical protein measurements. Levels of five AD-related proteins including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) and inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase (ITPK1) were measured using quantitative proteomics. We conducted adjusted linear mixed model analyses to examine associations of insulin signaling measures and AD-related proteins with longitudinally assessed cognitive function.ResultsHigher levels of IGFBP-5 and lower levels of ITPK1 were each associated with higher levels of AKT1 phosphorylation (pT<sup>308</sup>AKT1 /total AKT1). Additionally, higher levels of AKT1 phosphorylation were associated with faster decline in global cognition and most cognitive domains. IGFBP-5 partially mediated the association of AKT1 phosphorylation with the decline rate of global cognition and cognitive domains including perceptual speed and visuospatial abilities. Further, ITPK1 had an interaction with AKT1 phosphorylation on decline of global cognition and domains including episodic memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial abilities.ConclusionsAD-related proteins IGFBP-5 and ITPK1 are each associated with insulin signaling AKT1 phosphorylation in the postmortem human brain. Moreover, IGFBP-5 mediates, while ITPK1 moderates, the association between AKT1 phosphorylation and late-life cognitive decline.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40071121,Imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the correlation between cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) imaging markers and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: In July 2024, two researchers independently conducted a thorough literature search across databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The selected studies investigated the correlations between white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), lacunar infarction (LI), and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and the risk of AD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was employed to assess the risk of bias in the included cohort and case-control studies.
RESULTS: A total of 6,487 articles were identified, with 15 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses showed that WMHs (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.10-1.74, N = 7,661), CMBs (HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07-2.40, N = 6,567), and EPVS (HR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.24-2.72, N = 3,045) were associated with an increased risk of AD, with EPVS showing the strongest correlation. LI did not show a statistically significant association with an increased risk of AD (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.98-2.01, N = 4,014).
CONCLUSION: WMHs, CMBs, and EPVS are associated with an elevated risk of AD, whereas LI is considered a potential risk factor. However, additional studies are required to determine the role of CSVD markers in AD progression.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39740343,Applying recommendations for diagnostic disclosure of mild cognitive impairment and dementia: Practical guidance for clinicians.,"A comprehensive evaluation for cognitive impairment should culminate with the communication of the diagnosis to patients and their care partners. This diagnostic disclosure sets the stage for subsequent care. Diagnostic disclosure for individuals with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (ADRD) is particularly nuanced and requires a conscientious approach. Clinicians must assess patients' understanding and appreciation of symptoms, goals for the evaluation, and desire for information. Because AD/ADRD can impact patients' perceptions of their symptoms, it is recommended to include an informant or care partner for this assessment and for future care. Here, we provide guidance for addressing the complexities of AD/ADRD diagnostic disclosure to build clinicians' confidence in communicating diagnostic findings and a plan of care. HIGHLIGHTS: Diagnostic disclosure is a key part of the evaluation of cognitive impairment. The disclosure process begins at the moment a cognitive evaluation is initiated. Care partners must be included in the cognitive evaluation and diagnostic disclosure. Clinicians should use patient-centered communication for evaluation and disclosure.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39837812,Developing multifactorial dementia prediction models using clinical variables from cohorts in the US and Australia.,"Existing dementia prediction models using non-neuroimaging clinical measures have been limited in their ability to identify disease. This study used machine learning to re-examine the diagnostic potential of clinical measures for dementia. Data was sourced from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Clinical variables included 21 measures across medical history, hematological and other blood tests, and APOE genotype. Tree-based machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks were used. APOE genotype was the best predictor of dementia cases and healthy controls. Our results, however, demonstrated that there are limitations when using publicly accessible cohort data that may limit the generalizability and interpretability of such predictive models. Future research should examine the use of routine APOE genetic testing for dementia diagnostics. It should also focus on clearly unifying data across clinical cohorts.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
39775287,Essential tremor with tau pathology features seeds indistinguishable in conformation from Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy.,"Neurodegenerative tauopathies are characterized by the deposition of distinct fibrillar tau assemblies, whose rigid core structures correlate with defined neuropathological phenotypes. Essential tremor (ET) is a progressive neurological disorder that, in some cases, is associated with cognitive impairment and tau accumulation. In this study, we explored tau assembly conformation in ET patients with tau pathology using cytometry-based tau biosensor assays. These assays quantify the tau seeding activity present in brain homogenates by detecting the conversion of intracellular tau-fluorescent protein fusions from a soluble to an aggregated state. Pathogenic tau assemblies exhibit seeding barriers, where a specific assembly structure cannot serve as a template for a native monomer if the amino acid sequences are incompatible. We recently leveraged this species barrier to define tauopathies systematically by substituting alanine (Ala) into the tau monomer and measuring its incorporation into seeded aggregates within biosensor cells. This Ala scan precisely classified the conformation of tau seeds from various tauopathies. In this study, we analyzed 18 ET patient brains with tau pathology, detecting robust tau seeding activity in 9 (50%) of the cases, predominantly localized to the temporal pole and temporal cortex. We further examined 8 of these ET cases using the Ala scan and found that the amino acid requirements for tau monomer incorporation into aggregates seeded from ET brain homogenates were identical to those of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and distinct from other tauopathies, such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These findings indicate that in a pathologically confined subset of ET cases with significant tau pathology, tau assembly cores are identical to those seen in AD and PART. This could facilitate more precise diagnosis and targeted therapies for ET patients presenting with cognitive impairment.",Acta Neuropathol,2025
40188035,Fibre density and cross-section associate with hallmark pathology in early Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) propagates trans-synaptically along structurally connected brain networks and in synergy with amyloid pathology it induces synaptic damage. However, the in vivo relationship of amyloid, tau and synaptic density with white matter (WM) structural changes has been studied rather limitedly. Recent advances in diffusion MRI processing allow quantification of apparent fibre density and fibre cross-section on the fixel level, i.e., individual fibre populations within one voxel. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis of axonal loss due to tau propagation and amyloid pathology and its association with synaptic density in early disease stages.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 23 healthy controls (HC) underwent baseline amyloid (<sup>11</sup>C-PiB/<sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694), tau (<sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240) and synaptic density (<sup>11</sup>C-UCB-J binding to SV2A) PET/MR in combination with diffusion MRI and cognitive assessments. A subset of 14 aMCI patients underwent follow-up visits after 2 years. First, a whole-brain fixel-based analysis was performed to identify differences in fibre density and fibre cross-section between HC and aMCI and longitudinally in the aMCI group. Next, a tract-of-interest analysis was performed, focusing on the temporal-cingulum bundle where most alterations have been shown in early AD. Tau and SV2A PET were quantified in the connected regions, i.e., hippocampus and posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC-P). Amyloid PET centiloids were measured in the commonly used cortical composite volume-of-interest.
RESULTS: At baseline, multiple WM tracts showed lower fibre density and lower fibre cross-section in aMCI compared to HC, and these parameters further decreased longitudinally in the aMCI group. In the temporal cingulum bundle, reduced fibre density was significantly associated with reduced hippocampal synaptic density while increased hippocampal and PCC-P tau specifically correlated with reduced fibre cross-section. Increased global amyloid burden was associated with reduced fibre density and fibre cross-section in the temporal cingulum bundle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that WM degeneration already occurs in the aMCI stage of AD and alterations in apparent fibre density and fibre cross-section of the temporal cingulum bundle are associated with AD hallmark pathology.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40043118,The interplay between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on Alzheimer's disease risk in women.,"Menopause is a major biological transition that may influence women's late-life brain health. Earlier estrogen depletion-via earlier menopause-has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.",Sci Adv,2025

Derivative 27 was synthesized to improve low-dose efficacy in the context of AD. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-amyloidogenic activities were evaluated in chemico, in vitro using AD and neuroinflammation cell models, and in vivo using the double-transgenic APP/PS1 mice. In vitro, this curcumin derivative significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, inducible NO synthase, pro-interleukin-1β (Pro-IL-1β) and cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, Derivative 27 activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 transcription factor (Nrf2) and significantly increased Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase-1 protein levels in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, respectively. In one-year-old APP/PS1 mice, orally administered-Derivative 27 (50 mg/Kg/day) for 28 days improved spatial short-term memory and significantly decreased hippocampal Pro-IL-1β and amyloid precursor protein levels, as well as Aβ levels in the hippocampus and plasma. This study supports developing new chemical approaches to alter curcumin molecule, enabling lower doses, while increasing the effectiveness in AD treatment.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
40169805,Mettl3 regulates the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease via fine-tuning Lingo2.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and diverse factors contribute to its pathogenesis. Previous studies have suggested the dysregulation of m<sup>6</sup>A modification involves in AD, but the underlying mechanism and targets remain largely unknown. In the present study, we have shown that the levels of Mettl3 and m<sup>6</sup>A modification are increased in specific brain regions of 5xFAD mice and post-mortem AD patients, respectively. Heterozygous deletion of neuronal Mettl3 (AD::Mettl3<sup>+/-</sup>) reduced Aβ plaques and inflammation, and improved learning and memory of AD mice, and vice versa for Mettl3 knock in (AD::Mettl3-KI). Mechanistically, we observed that the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of Lingo2 increased in 5xFAD mice and AD patients, which promoted the binding of Ythdf2 and enhanced the degradation of Lingo2 mRNA. The decreased level of Lingo2 promoted the interaction between APP and β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (Bace1), and subsequently enhanced Aβ production in AD mice, which can be inhibited by Mettl3 depletion. Both ectopic Lingo2 and the administration of Mettl3 inhibitor STM2457 significantly alleviated the neuropathology and behavioral deficits of AD mice. In summary, our study has revealed the important function of Mettl3 and m<sup>6</sup>A in the pathogenesis of AD and provided novel insight for the underlying mechanisms.

These plants are considered the source of numerous medicinal compounds. For instance, silymarin is a polyphenolic flavonoid extract obtained from the milk thistle plant or Silybum marianum which has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects and great therapeutic benefits. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a class of neurological diseases that have become more prevalent in recent years, and although treatment is available, there is no complete cure developed yet. Silymarin utilizes a range of molecular mechanisms, including modulation of MAPK, AMPK, NF-κB, mTOR, and PI3K/Akt pathways, along with various receptors, enzymes, and growth factors. These mechanisms collectively contribute to its protective effects against NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Despite its safety and efficacy, silymarin faces challenges related to bioavailability and aqueous solubility, hindering its development as a clinical drug. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying silymarin's neuroprotective effects, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for NDs.",Mol Neurobiol,2025

39908349,Proteomic analysis reveals distinct cerebrospinal fluid signatures across genetic frontotemporal dementia subtypes.,"We used an untargeted mass spectrometric approach, tandem mass tag proteomics, for the identification of proteomic signatures in genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A total of 238 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the Genetic FTD Initiative were analyzed, including samples from 107 presymptomatic (44 C9orf72, 38 GRN, and 25 MAPT) and 55 symptomatic (27 C9orf72, 17 GRN, and 11 MAPT) mutation carriers as well as 76 mutation-negative controls (""noncarriers""). We found shared and distinct proteomic alterations in each genetic form of FTD. Among the proteins significantly altered in symptomatic mutation carriers compared with noncarriers, we found that a set of proteins including neuronal pentraxin 2 and fatty acid binding protein 3 changed across all three genetic forms of FTD and patients with Alzheimer's disease from previously published datasets. We observed differential changes in lysosomal proteins among symptomatic mutation carriers with marked abundance decreases in MAPT carriers but not other carriers. Further, we identified mutation-associated proteomic changes already evident in presymptomatic mutation carriers. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis combined with gene ontology annotation revealed clusters of proteins enriched in neurodegeneration and glial responses as well as synapse- or lysosome-related proteins indicating that these are the central biological processes affected in genetic FTD. These clusters correlated with measures of disease severity and were associated with cognitive decline. This study revealed distinct proteomic changes in the CSF of patients with genetic FTD, providing insights into the pathological processes involved in the disease. In addition, we identified proteins that warrant further exploration as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker candidates.",Sci Transl Med,2025
39914370,Longitudinal Analysis of Objective and Self-Reported Cognitive Functions in Individuals with Subjective Cognitive Decline.,"INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered a preclinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent research suggests that subtle cognitive changes in SCD are linked to an increased risk of clinical decline. This study investigates the longitudinal trajectories of both objective and self-reported cognitive functions in individuals with SCD, with a focus on the impact of subtle cognitive impairment (SCI).
METHODS: A total of 107 individuals with SCD, with at least two annual follow-ups, were included in this study. We analyzed the trajectories of both objective and subjective cognitive functions, assessed changes in medial temporal lobe regional volumes, and compared baseline AD biomarkers between SCD individuals with SCI (n = 22, SCI group) and without SCI (n = 85).
RESULTS: SCD individuals with SCI showed a faster decline in objective cognitive function over time compared to those without SCI, who exhibited cognitive improvement. Self-reported cognitive complaints showed no differences between groups at baseline or in annual changes over time. The SCI group had lower baseline entorhinal cortical volumes and greater volume reductions over time and also exhibited more abnormalities in AD biomarkers, including higher amyloid PET positivity, a lower Aβ 42/40 ratio, and elevated p-tau181.
CONCLUSION: SCI status in SCD individuals is associated with significant cognitive decline, along with more abnormal AD biomarkers. These findings suggest that early identification of SCI status in individuals with SCD may improve the prediction of cognitive decline. However, self-reported cognitive complaints may have a limited role in monitoring clinical changes in SCD.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,2025
39839077,Unraveling the impact of blood RANKL and OPG levels on Alzheimer's disease: Independent of bone mineral density and inflammation.,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have revealed a close relationship between reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) system, pivotal in regulating bone metabolism, has been implicated in brain function, but the causal impact on AD risk remains unclear.
METHODS: We employed bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) approaches to elucidate the effect of blood soluble RANKL (sRANKL) and OPG levels on AD, assessing whether this influence was independent of BMD and inflammation. Three distinct AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), UK Biobank (UKB), and FinnGen were utilized. Summary-level data on blood sRANKL and OPG were sourced from deCODE Genetics.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted per standard deviation (SD) increase in blood sRANKL levels was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD across all three AD GWAS data sets (IGAP: odds ratio [OR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.72-0.94, p = 0.004; UKB: OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78-0.91, p &lt; 0.001; FinnGen: OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.73-0.94, p = 0.004). No significant causal relationship was observed between OPG levels and AD. In addition, there was no causal impact of AD on the blood levels of sRANKL and OPG. MVMR results showed that the inverse association between sRANKL and AD risk persisted after adjusting for BMD and interleukin-1α and chemoattractant protein-1.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides evidence that elevated sRANKL levels are causally linked to a reduced risk of AD, independent of BMD and inflammation. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between bone metabolism and AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (sRANKL) levels are linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).The association between sRANKL levels and AD is independent of bone mineral density (BMD) and inflammation.No causal link exists between blood osteoprotegerin levels and AD.AD does not affect blood levels of sRANKL or osteoprotegerin.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40194420,"Associations Between Neuropsychiatric Symptom Burden, Change in Cognitive Status and Survival in Autopsy-confirmed Cohorts of Lewy Body Disease and Alzheimer's Disease (P1-5.028).","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) burden and cognitive status on survival in pathological cohorts of Lewy body disease (LBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
BACKGROUND: Presence of pathological LBD is typically associated with higher NPS burden and poorer survival. Predictors of mortality at dementia diagnosis include age, more depression and worse cognitive status. Predictors of survival during early cognitive changes and relationship to final pathological burden is unknown.
DESIGN/METHODS: We included 313 initially non-demented cases from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND) with longitudinal Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores who came to autopsy (mean follow-up duration 6±4 years). Participants were categorized by final Unified Staging System for Lewy Body Disorders (USSLB) (stage-I [n=9], IIA-B [n=32, 16], III [n=59], IV [n=70]); 127 cases had USSLB stage-0, including AD without LB (n=66). We performed Cox regression analyses, adjusting for cognitive status change, age, sex, motor subscale of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III), and Functional Assessment Scale (FAS) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.
RESULTS: Individuals with USSLB stages III-IV were younger at first NPI-Q (mean 79±7 years) and at death (mean 85±8 years) (p<0.05). UPDRS-III (mean 23±15) and frequency of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) status (37%) at first NPI-Q were highest for USSLB stage-IV (p<0.05). Total initial NPI-Q score was highest for USSLB stage-IIB (mean 3.6±3.4), followed by stage-IV (3.3±3.4) and III (2.9±3.7) (p<0.05). While nighttime behaviors were most frequent/severe in stage-IIB, hallucinations were most prominent in stage-IV (p<0.05). When analyzing survival across all cases irrespective of underlying pathology, higher first available total NPI-Q, progression to dementia, age and UPDRS-III at first NPI-Q were predictive of worse survival (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive progression to dementia (not MCI), higher initial NPI-Q scores, older age, and poorer baseline motor function, were associated with worse survival across pathological cases of LBD and AD.

39941597,The Brain Toxin Cleansing of Sleep Achieved During Wakefulness.,"A primary purpose of sleep for humans is to remove toxins and metabolic wastes from the brain (e.g., Aβ, tau, lactate) that would otherwise build up and compromise brain functionality. There are currently no drugs or devices that have been clinically shown in humans to enhance brain toxin removal, either during sleep or wakefulness. This perspective article focuses on a recently (re)discovered major route of toxin drainage from the human brain through meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) and the primary enhancer of their flow-the cytokine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The purpose of this perspective article is to present pre-clinical and clinical evidence relevant to a new bioengineered technology (Transcranial Radiofrequency Treatment; TRFT) that appears to enhance mLV flow to increase brain toxin cleansing in humans during wakefulness. In being both safe and non-invasive, TRFT is administered in-home, presently through a device called ""MemorEM"". Two months of daily TRFT during wakefulness increased the typically low plasma/brain levels of VEGF in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects, which was associated with increased Aβ and tau toxin removal from their brains during wakefulness-ostensibly through VEGF-increased mLV flow. Even irrespective of baseline VEGF levels, brain toxin cleansing was increased by TRFT in AD subjects, who also experienced a notable reversal of their cognitive impairment after TRFT. Additional clinical studies are nonetheless required to firmly establish TRFT's brain cleansing abilities during wakefulness. In performing a major duty of sleep, TRFT during wakefulness is proposed as a viable intervention to counter the decline in nighttime brain toxin cleansing that occurs with aging and in multiple brain diseases, most notably Alzheimer's Disease. The implications of TRFT for insomnia and for sleep deprivation are also discussed, as is the potential for TRFT to extend healthy human longevity.",J Clin Med,2025
39816192,Aberrant functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampal subregions in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"The posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus are the core regions involved in episodic memory, and they exhibit functional connectivity changes in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that the posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus are both cytoarchitectonically heterogeneous regions. Specifically, the retrosplenial cortex, typically subsumed under the posterior cingulate cortex, is an area functionally and anatomically distinct from the posterior cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus is composed of several subregions that participate in multiple cognitive processes. However, little is known about the functional connectivity patterns of the retrosplenial cortex or other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex with hippocampal subregions and their differential vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 60 Alzheimer's disease participants, 60 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and 60 sex-matched normal controls. The bilateral retrosplenial cortex, other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus subregions (including the bilateral anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus) were selected to investigate functional connectivity alterations in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis demonstrated heterogeneity in the degree of connectivity between the hippocampus and different parts of the total posterior cingulate cortex, with considerably greater functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex with the hippocampus compared with other parts of the posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, the bilateral retrosplenial cortex exhibited widespread intrinsic functional connectivity with all anterior-posterior hippocampus subregions. Compared to the normal controls, the amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups showed different magnitudes of decreased functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and the contralateral posterior hippocampus. Additionally, diminished functional connectivity between the left retrosplenial cortex and right posterior hippocampus was correlated with clinical disease severity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment subjects, and the combination of multiple functional connectivity indicators of the retrosplenial cortex can discriminate the three groups from each other. These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that the retrosplenial cortex is extensively and functionally connected with hippocampus subregions and that these functional connections are selectively affected in the Alzheimer's disease continuum, with prominent disruptions in functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and contralateral posterior hippocampus underpinning episodic memory impairment associated with the disease.",Brain Commun,2025

39966925,Sex differences in the association of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cognition in a multicenter memory clinic study.,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated sex differences in the associations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, cognitive performance, and decline in memory clinic settings.
METHODS: 249 participants (females/males:123/126), who underwent tau-PET, amyloid-PET, structural MRI, and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) measurement were included from Geneva and Lausanne Memory Clinics. Mann-Whitney U tests investigated sex differences in clinical and biomarker data. Linear regression models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between biomarkers and cognitive performance and decline. Sex differences in cognitive decline were further evaluated using longitudinal linear mixed-effect models with three-way interaction effects.
RESULTS: Women and men present similar clinical features, amyloid, and neurodegeneration. Women had higher tau load and plasma levels of GFAP than men (p < 0.05). Tau associations with amyloid (standardized β = 0.54,p < 0.001), neurodegeneration (standardized β=-0.44,p < 0.001), and cognition (standardized β=-0.48,p < 0.001) were moderated by a significant interaction with sex. Specifically, the association between amyloid and tau was stronger among women than men (standardized β=-0.19,p = 0.047), whereas the associations between tau and cognition and between tau and neurodegeneration were stronger among men than in women (standardized β=-0.76,p = 0.001 and standardized β=-0.56,p = 0.044). Women exhibited faster cognitive decline than men in the presence of severe cortical thinning (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Women showed higher tau load and stronger association between amyloid and tau than men. In individuals with high tau burden, men exhibited greater neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment than women. These findings support that sex differences may impact tau deposition through an upstream interplay with amyloid, leading to downstream effects on neurodegeneration and cognitive outcomes.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40151917,"Sex differences on tau, astrocytic, and neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers.","BackgroundSex differences have consistently been identified on autopsy, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid outcomes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the exact mechanisms for these associations are unclear. Blood-based biomarkers are practical alternatives for the investigation of mechanisms of AD, in addition to accurate disease detection and monitoring.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to examine sex differences across a panel of blood-based plasma biomarkers in participants with and without cognitive impairment due to AD.MethodsPlasma samples were collected from 567 participants from across the AD diagnostic continuum (i.e., normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia) and analyzed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau<sub>181</sub>), and total tau (t-tau). Baseline and longitudinal analyses evaluated for any significant associations between sex and AD-related plasma biomarkers.ResultsFemales were found to have higher plasma GFAP compared to males at baseline regardless of cognitive diagnosis. Among those with AD dementia, females were also found to have higher NfL levels compared to males. Longitudinal analyses found that higher plasma NfL at baseline was associated with an increased risk of worsening AD dementia status only in females. No significant findings were observed for p-tau<sub>181</sub> or t-tau.ConclusionsThis study found significant sex differences in plasma biomarkers of GFAP and NfL.

39773296,Variables associated with cognitive function: an exposome-wide and mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that cognitive function is influenced by potential environmental factors. We aimed to determine the variables influencing cognitive function.
METHODS: Our study included 164,463 non-demented adults (89,644 [54.51%] female; mean [SD] age, 56.69 [8.14] years) from the UK Biobank who completed four cognitive assessments at baseline. 364 variables were finally extracted for analysis through a rigorous screening process. We performed univariate analyses to identify variables significantly associated with each cognitive function in two equal-sized split discovery and replication datasets. Subsequently, the identified variables in univariate analyses were further assessed in a multivariable model. Additionally, for the variables identified in multivariable model, we explored the associations with longitudinal cognitive decline. Moreover, one- and two- sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to confirm the genetic associations. Finally, the quality of the pooled evidence for the associations between variables and cognitive function was evaluated.
RESULTS: 252 variables (69%) exhibited significant associations with at least one cognitive function in the discovery dataset. Of these, 231 (92%) were successfully replicated. Subsequently, our multivariable analyses identified 41 variables that were significantly associated with at least one cognitive function, spanning categories such as education, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, body measurements, mental health, medical conditions, early life factors, and household characteristics. Among these 41 variables, 12 were associated with more than one cognitive domain, and were further identified in all subgroup analyses. And LASSO, rigde, and principal component analysis indicated the robustness of the primary results. Moreover, among these 41 variables, 12 were significantly associated with a longitudinal cognitive decline. Furthermore, 22 were supported by one-sample MR analysis, and 5 were further confirmed by two-sample MR analysis. Additionally, the quality of the pooled evidence for the associations between 10 variables and cognitive function was rated as high. Based on these 10 identified variables, adopting a more favorable lifestyle was significantly associated with 38% and 34% decreased risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study constructed an evidence database of variables associated with cognitive function, which could contribute to the prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39834619,An EEG-based framework for automated discrimination of conversion to Alzheimer's disease in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment: an 18-month longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: As a clinical precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) bears a considerably heightened risk of transitioning to AD compared to cognitively normal elders. Early prediction of whether aMCI will progress to AD is of paramount importance, as it can provide pivotal guidance for subsequent clinical interventions in an early and effective manner.
METHODS: A total of 107 aMCI cases were enrolled and their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected at the time of the initial diagnosis. During 18-month follow-up period, 42 individuals progressed to AD (PMCI), while 65 remained in the aMCI stage (SMCI). Spectral, nonlinear, and functional connectivity features were extracted from the EEG data, subjected to feature selection and dimensionality reduction, and then fed into various machine learning classifiers for discrimination. The performance of each model was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated in terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score.
RESULTS: Compared to SMCI patients, PMCI patients exhibit a trend of ""high to low"" frequency shift, decreased complexity, and a disconnection phenomenon in EEG signals. An epoch-based classification procedure, utilizing the extracted EEG features and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, achieved the ACC of 99.96%, AUC of 99.97%, SEN of 99.98%, SPE of 99.95%, PPV of 99.93%, and F1-score of 99.96%. Meanwhile, the subject-based classification procedure also demonstrated commendable performance, achieving an ACC of 78.37%, an AUC of 83.89%, SEN of 77.68%, SPE of 76.24%, PPV of 82.55%, and F1-score of 78.47%.
CONCLUSION: Aiming to explore the EEG biomarkers with predictive value for AD in the early stages of aMCI, the proposed discriminant framework provided robust longitudinal evidence for the trajectory of the aMCI cases, aiding in the achievement of early diagnosis and proactive intervention.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024

Recent evidence indicates that inflammation plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, with elevated inflammatory markers and risk genes linked to innate immune functions. Glial cell dysfunction, particularly in astrocytes and microglia, is crucial to the neuroinflammatory process, contributing to oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and impaired neurogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of benfotiamine (BFT), a vitamin B1 analogue, on microglial morphology, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters in a sporadic Alzheimer-like disease model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Supplementation with 150 mg/kg of BFT for 7 days significantly reduced inflammation in the hippocampus and provided protection against oxidative damage in the entorhinal cortex by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD1 and CAT. These findings suggest that BFT exerts neuroprotective effects in AD, particularly impacting glial cell function and redox homeostasis.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39814524,Subjective motoric cognitive risk syndrome: Preliminary prevalence from an online survey of a German cohort aged 50.,"The motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a novel and clinically relevant pre-dementia syndrome indicating a higher dementia risk (e.g., for Alzheimer's disease). Given that MCR prevalence is unknown in Germany, we conducted a cross-sectional study, in which 208 participants from Germany aged 50 and 82 years answered an online survey including questions to assess subjective MCR (sMCR). The adjusted sMCR prevalence was 25.3%. Adults with sMCR reported more diseases and showed negative associations with physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, suggesting that lifestyle modifications can play a significant role in MCR prevention. Further research is required to complement our preliminary findings on sMCR prevalence in Germany.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39760516,Cell-type specific epigenetic clocks to quantify biological age at cell-type resolution.,"The ability to accurately quantify biological age could help monitor and control healthy aging. Epigenetic clocks have emerged as promising tools for estimating biological age, yet they have been developed from heterogeneous bulk tissues, and are thus composites of two aging processes, one reflecting the change of cell-type composition with age and another reflecting the aging of individual cell-types. There is thus a need to dissect and quantify these two components of epigenetic clocks, and to develop epigenetic clocks that can yield biological age estimates at cell-type resolution. Here we demonstrate that in blood and brain, approximately 39% and 12% of an epigenetic clock's accuracy is driven by underlying shifts in lymphocyte and neuronal subsets, respectively. Using brain and liver tissue as prototypes, we build and validate neuron and hepatocyte specific DNA methylation clocks, and demonstrate that these cell-type specific clocks yield improved estimates of chronological age in the corresponding cell and tissue-types. We find that neuron and glia specific clocks display biological age acceleration in Alzheimer's Disease with the effect being strongest for glia in the temporal lobe. Moreover, CpGs from these clocks display a small but significant overlap with the causal DamAge-clock, mapping to key genes implicated in neurodegeneration. The hepatocyte clock is found accelerated in liver under various pathological conditions. In contrast, non-cell-type specific clocks do not display biological age-acceleration, or only do so marginally. In summary, this work highlights the importance of dissecting epigenetic clocks and quantifying biological age at cell-type resolution.",Aging (Albany NY),2024
39907502,"""By the Time We Knew …"": Poetic Analysis of End-of-Life Caregiving Experiences for Rapidly Progressive and Slower-Duration Dementia Syndromes.","BACKGROUND: One in three older adults in the United States dies with or from dementia. Little is known about whether end-of-life caregiving experiences differ by dementia diagnosis.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of two qualitative studies. Participants included caregivers of decedents with ""rapid-type"" sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD, survival prognosis of < 1 year) or ""slow-type"" Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (survival prognosis of 5-20 years). We used reflexive thematic analysis and a novel method, poetic analysis, to compare end-of-life caregiving experiences.
RESULTS: ""Rapid-type"" caregivers (n = 12) had a median age of 59 (range 45-73) years; 6 were female, and 9 were spouses. ""Slow-type"" caregivers (n = 15) had a median age of 69 (45-82) years; 9 were female, and 11 were spouses. We identified three main areas of differential experience that were influenced by syndrome rarity and participation in research yet hinged on time. Time enables preparation: Due to the rarity of sCJD, ""rapid-type"" caregivers struggled to obtain accurate diagnoses, which prevented preparation for end-of-life care. Weeks or months before death, specialists simultaneously disclosed sCJD diagnoses and recommended hospice. In contrast, for ""slow-type"" dementia, preparation began years before death. Time complicates conflict: Most ""rapid-type"" caregivers described conflicts, rarely resolved before death, about code status, treatment, or care location decisions. Fewer ""slow-type"" caregivers experienced such conflicts, and these were typically resolved before death; instead, they experienced conflict between needs and what the care system provides. Postmortem experience contrasts with perimortem: For ""rapid-type"" dementia, short perimortem periods contrasted with elongated and often intense postmortem logistics and grief. For ""slow-type"" caregivers, preparation and perimortem grieving typically led to shorter duration and minimally intrusive postmortem logistics and grief.
CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life care for dementia should attend to and support axes of differential experience based on diagnosis and rarity, time since symptom onset (affecting preparation and conflict resolution), and participation in research studies.",J Am Geriatr Soc,2025
39881195,Oligodendrocytes in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.,"Our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has transformed from a purely neuronal perspective to one that acknowledges the involvement of glial cells. Despite remarkable progress in unraveling the biology of microglia, astrocytes and vascular elements, the exploration of oligodendrocytes in AD is still in its early stages. Contrary to the traditional notion of oligodendrocytes as passive bystanders in AD pathology, emerging evidence indicates their active participation in and reaction to amyloid and tau pathology. Oligodendrocytes undergo a functional transition to a disease-associated state, engaging in immune modulation, stress responses and cellular survival. Far from being inert players, they appear to serve a dual role in AD pathogenesis, potentially offering defense mechanisms against pathology while also contributing to disease progression. This Review explores recent advancements in understanding the roles of oligodendrocytes and their myelin sheaths in the context of AD, shedding light on their complex interactions within the disease pathology.",Nat Neurosci,2025
39885271,Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 localized to primary endothelial cilia regulates blood pressure and cognition.,"We previously demonstrated that the inability of primary endothelial cilia to sense fluid shear stress can lead to nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and cause hypertension (HTN). Decreased biosynthesis of NO contributes to cerebral amyloid angiopathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients through increased deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HTN and AD are incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiological roles of vascular primary cilia and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (CHRM3) in HTN and AD. We discovered, for the first time, that CHRM3 was localized to primary cilia of endothelial and cerebrovascular cells, and that CHRM3 expression was downregulated in cilialess cells. Moreover, CHRM3 activation enhanced cilia length and sensory function in terms of eNOS activation. To further examine the role of vascular CHRM3 in vivo, we showed that endothelial CHRM3 knockout was associated with increased BP and attenuated acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation. In addition, endothelial CHRM3 knockout resulted in altered fear behavior. This demonstrates the physiological significance of endothelial CHRM3 signaling and primary cilia-derived NO production as an important mechanism in the control of BP and cognition.",Sci Rep,2025
40193957,Combination of Plasma Beta Amyloid 42/40 and P-tau217 in the Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease (S15.004).,"OBJECTIVE: Determine whether combining plasma beta amyloid 42/40 and p-tau217 could achieve ≥90 sensitivity and specificity in evaluating patients at an ADRC for possible Alzheimer's disease (AD).
BACKGROUND: Advances in the ability to utilize plasma biomarkers to assess AD pathology provided new tools for assessing patients with cognitive impairment. With the emergence of anti-amyloid therapies, efficient diagnostic evaluation is needed to help identify treatment candidates accurately and timely. Combining biomarkers could provide a scalable diagnostic evaluation to identify AD patients for these therapies.
DESIGN/METHODS: Patients from the 1Florida ADRC with clinical evaluations and PET scan data (n=276; 39.1% prevalence) were evaluated for Abeta42/40 and apoprotein E4 (ApoE4) proteotype status by LC-MS/MS and p-tau217 by immunoassay. A likelihood score model was determined for each biomarker and the combination of Abeta42/40 and p-tau217 with or without ApoE4 status. Model performance included the use of two cut points for PET positivity.
RESULTS: For the intended use cohort (46.0% prevalence of PET-positivity), a combination of Aβ42/40, p-tau217, and APOE4 allele count provided the best model with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.942 and with cut points fixed at 91% sensitivity and 91% specificity yielding 88% positive predictive value (PPV), 91% negative predictive value (NPV), and 87% accuracy for identifying amyloid PET status. Inclusion of APOE4 allele count also reduced the percentage of patients with indeterminate risk by 33% (from 15% to 10%). The model and cut points categorized the real-world clinical specimens as having 42% (1,822) high, 51% (2,204) low, and 7% (300) indeterminant likelihood for PET positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining plasma biomarkers for Abeta42/40 and p-tau217 shows significant promise as a scalable approach when evaluating patients with cognitive impairment for potential AD pathology. These data suggest that utilization of Abeta42/40 and p-tau217 tests together can accurately assess AD pathology with ≥90% sensitivity and specificity.

39710611,Asymmetrical patterns of β-amyloid deposition and cognitive changes in Alzheimer's disease: the SILCODE study.,"The asymmetric pattern of β-amyloid plaque distribution across Alzheimer's disease clinical progression stages remains unclear. In this study, 66 participants with normal cognition, 59 with subjective cognitive decline, 12 with mild cognitive impairment, and 11 with Alzheimer's disease dementia were included in the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE) cohort. A regional asymmetry index, denoting the left-right asymmetry of β-amyloid plaques, was derived for each region based on the Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas. The level of β-amyloid plaques in each region was compared among different clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease using the analysis of variance. An additional correlation analysis examined the relationship between each region of interest's cognitive performance scores and asymmetry index values. We found that β-amyloid appears to be lateralized in different stages of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, there is a significant correlation between β-amyloid asymmetry in various brain regions and cognition. The observed Aβ lateralization could potentially be utilized as a neuroimaging biomarker throughout AD progression.",Cereb Cortex,2024
39839310,Threshold effects of sleep duration and cognitive function in older adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.,"BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that older adults' cognitive capacities can be improved with sleep duration. However, the relationship between overweight, obesity, and cognitive decline remains a subject of debate. The impact of sleep duration on cognitive performance in seniors with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is largely unknown. This makes it an intriguing subject to explore further.
METHODS: This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2011-2014) with 2,243 participants. Weighted multivariate linear regression and smooth curve fitting were employed to investigate linear and non-linear relationships. A two-part linear regression model was used to determine the threshold effects. Additionally, subgroup analysis and interaction tests were conducted.
RESULTS: Results showed that a negative association was found between sleep duration and scores in the fully adjusted model in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, the Animal Fluency test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). A two-piecewise linear regression model was then applied to explore the threshold effect of sleep duration on cognitive performance. When sleep duration was less than 5 and 6 h per day, sleep duration was positively correlated with CERAD test scores [ß (95% CI): 2.11 (1.17, 3.05), p &lt; 0.0001], AFT scores [β (95% CI): 0.25 (-0.17, 0.67), p = 0.2376], and DSST scores [ß (95% CI): 0.49 (-0.57, 1.56), p = 0.3654]. However, there was a threshold effect where sleep duration reached the three inflection points.
CONCLUSION: In overweight and obese older adults, there is a clear inverted U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function, with consistent results across different subgroups. Sleep durations of around 5-6 h may help prevent cognitive decline in older adults with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40018326,Accrual of Alzheimer's disease pathology as a function of proximity to parental dementia onset.,"INTRODUCTION: Whether temporal proximity to parental onset of dementia (PPO) can be used to estimate timing of the preclinical stage of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains uncertain.
METHODS: We investigated cross-sectionally adults aged &gt; 50 without dementia included in the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) study. PPO was tested as a predictor of quantitative levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (1-42) (Aβ1-42) in those with a parental history of dementia (n = 688) and of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and EPAD neuropsychological examination (ENE) subscores in an amyloid positive subgroup (n = 226). Possible interactions were explored.
RESULTS: Shorter PPO predicted lower CSF Aβ1-42 level (β = 9.357; T = 4.161; p &lt; 0.001), interacting with apolipoprotein E (APOE) -𝜀4 carriage in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitant APOE-𝜀2 carriage appeared to provide protection. PPO did not predict p-tau levels or cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: PPO may provide a valid method of stratifying risk of early AD pathologic change in APOE-𝜀4 carriers, with empirical and clinical applications.
HIGHLIGHTS: Proximity to age of parental dementia onset can predict amyloid accrualThe effect is APOE-𝜀4 dose-dependent and APOE-𝜀2 appears to provide protectionPPO does not appear to predict further advancement along the AD continuumIn the era of anti-amyloid treatments, this may inform timing of amyloid screeningUsed as an empirical metric, PPO could help elucidate the natural history of LOAD.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39737627,Microstructural mapping of neural pathways in Alzheimer's disease using macrostructure-informed normative tractometry.,"INTRODUCTION: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is sensitive to the microstructural properties of brain tissues and shows great promise in detecting the effects of degenerative diseases. However, many approaches analyze single measures averaged over regions of interest without considering the underlying fiber geometry.
METHODS: We propose a novel macrostructure-informed normative tractometry (MINT) framework to investigate how white matter (WM) microstructure and macrostructure are jointly altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We compared MINT-derived metrics with univariate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to examine how fiber geometry may impact the interpretation of microstructure.
RESULTS: In two multisite cohorts from North America and India, we find consistent patterns of microstructural and macrostructural anomalies implicated in MCI and dementia; we also rank diffusion metrics' sensitivity to dementia.
DISCUSSION: We show that MINT, by jointly modeling tract shape and microstructure, has the potential to disentangle and better interpret the effects of degenerative disease on the brain's neural pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics may be due to macroscopic changes. Normative models encode normal variability of diffusion metrics in healthy controls. Variational autoencoder applied on tractography can learn patterns of fiber geometry. WM microstructure and macrostructure are modeled with multivariate methods. Transfer learning uses pretraining and fine-tuning for increased efficiency.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39737333,Aftereffect of single transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation on spontaneous home-cage and open-field EEG activities in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: As a non drug and non invasive therapy, both transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may modulate cortical rhythms and serve as potentially effective approaches to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies using animal models of AD are quite limited.
METHODS: This study investigates the aftereffects of tACS and tDCS on brain EEG activity and associated exploratory behavior in normal aged and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (15 months old). Anodal tDCS and 10 Hz tACS (350 μA, 20 min) were applied once and EEGs were recorded from the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during spontaneous home-cage state and open-field exploration.
RESULTS: A key finding was that tDCS induced significant alpha (8-12 Hz) EEG changes while tACS induced peak frequency changes in the group difference between normal aged and AD mice. However, both groups showed similar increases in theta (4-8 Hz) EEG activity during open-field exploration and increases in gamma (20-100 Hz) EEG activity in spontaneous state, suggesting that the ongoing physiological state may be related to some of the EEG changes.
CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the short-term aftereffects of transcranial current stimulation in the aging and AD brain and is the first animal study to compare brain activity between tACS and tDCS treatments.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40068731,"Studying the effect of Chlamydia trachomatis, Helicobacter pylori, and Varicella zoster microorganisms in stimulating the expression of cytokines TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, IL-10 in Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer patients.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to use the real-time RT-PCR method to detect the gene expression cytokines IL-10, TNFα, IFN-γ, and TGF-β in the serum of Alzheimer's patients.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 100 serum samples of Alzheimer's patients. DNA extraction was performed on the samples with the Cinnaclone kit and PCR techniques were used to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Varicella zoster virus. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to measure the expression of TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, and IL-10 genes with a Smobio kit.
RESULTS: The relative changes in the expression of TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, and IL-10 genes were observed in Alzheimer's patients compared to the control samples without microorganisms, and a significant increase was observed (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the cytokines TNFα, IFNɤ, TGFβ, and IL-10, have an increase in Alzheimer's patients(P < 0.05). Therefore, the presence of the microorganisms accompanied by the rise and inducing the expression of cytokines compared to the groups without the mentioned microorganisms causes a significant increase in the production of cytokines effective in the occurrence or exacerbation of Alzheimer's disease.",Neurosci Lett,2025
39919257,Association Between Lifestyle at Different Life Periods and Brain Integrity in Older Adults.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lifestyle behaviors, including engagement in complex mental activities, have been associated with dementia risk and neuroimaging markers of aging and Alzheimer disease. However, the life period(s) at which lifestyle factors have the greatest influence on brain health remains unclear. Our objective was to determine the relative influence of lifestyle (i.e., engagement in complex mental activities) at different life periods on older adults' brain health.
METHODS: This observational study included community-dwelling cognitively unimpaired seniors (older than 65 years) from the Age-Well randomized controlled trial (Caen, France). All participants completed at baseline the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire, assessing engagement in complex mental activities during young adulthood (13-30 years: LEQ-young), midlife (30-65 years: LEQ-midlife), and late-life (older than 65 years: LEQ-late). LEQ scores were divided into specific and non-specific activities. Multiple regressions were conducted including LEQ scores at the 3 life periods (same model) to predict gray matter volume (GMv; structural-MRI), glucose metabolism (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET), perfusion (early-Florbetapir-PET), or amyloid burden (late-Florbetapir-PET), both in AD-signature regions and voxel-wise (significance for voxel-wise analyses: p &lt; 0.005<sub>uncorrected</sub>, k &gt; 100). Correlations between LEQ and neuroimaging outcomes were then compared between (1) life periods and (2) specific and non-specific activities. Analyses were controlled for age and sex.
RESULTS: In 135 older adults (mean age = 69.3 years; women = 61.5%), no associations were found within AD-signature regions (all p &gt; 0.25). Voxel-wise analyses revealed no association between LEQ-young and neuroimaging. LEQ-midlife showed stronger voxel-wise associations than the other periods with GMv, notably in the anterior cingulate cortex, and with amyloid burden in the precuneus. These correlations were stronger for the LEQ-midlife specific (i.e., occupation) than the non-specific subscore (GMv: z = 3.25, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.1292-0.5135]; amyloid: z = -1.88, p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI [-0.3810 to -0.0113]). LEQ-late showed stronger voxel-wise associations than the other periods with perfusion and glucose metabolism in medial frontal regions. The correlation of perfusion with LEQ-late was stronger for non-specific than specific subscore (z = 2.88, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [0.0894-0.4606]).
DISCUSSION: Lifestyle at different life periods may have complementary benefits on brain health in regions related to reserve/resilience in aging. While past (midlife) engagement could promote resistance against structural/pathologic alterations, current (late-life) engagement could enhance cognitive reserve. Future larger longitudinal studies should explore mechanisms by which lifestyle promotes reserve.",Neurology,2025
39985404,SCD-plus features and AD biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired samples: A meta-analytic approach for nine cohort studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Specific features of subjective cognitive decline (SCD-plus) have been proposed to indicate an increased risk of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies have examined how these features relate to AD biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults.
METHODS: Meta-analyses were performed using cross-sectional data from nine cohorts (n = 7219, mean age (SD): 71.17 (5.9), 56.5% female) to determine associations of SCD-plus features with positron emission tomography (PET)- or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau biomarkers.
RESULTS: Participants with preclinical AD (community-based only) were more likely to fulfill SCD-plus features. The presence of self-reported memory decline, associated concern/worry, and a higher number of fulfilled features were all associated with high Aβ levels. Only the latter was associated with abnormal tau.
DISCUSSION: Simultaneous endorsement of multiple SCD-plus features is a robust indicator of abnormal AD biomarkers in CU older adults, whereas isolated SCD features seem only sensitive to elevated Aβ, supporting their value as early behavioral markers of preclinical AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: About two-tenths of our sample had abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels with evidence of subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Preclinical AD subsamples (community-based) had a higher percentage of participants meeting SCD-plus features. Self-reported memory decline and concern/worry were the sole features associated with high Aβ, but not tau, burden. A higher number of fulfilled SCD-plus features are linked to high Aβ and tau burden. Use of multiple SCD-plus features may help identify early stages of biological AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39780222,Post-marketing safety concerns with lecanemab: a pharmacovigilance study based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database.,"BACKGROUND: The safety data of lecanemab in the post-marketing period has yet to be fully investigated in the current literature. We aimed to identify and characterise the safety profile of lecanemab in the post-marketing period.
METHODS: We searched and reviewed the reports submitted to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). We used a case/non-case approach to estimate the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for lecanemab-related adverse events (AEs) reported at least four counts. We compared the difference between serious and non-serious reports using non-parametric tests.
RESULTS: The FAERS recorded 1,986 lecanemab-related AEs affecting 868 patients. Two hundred and three patients experienced serious AEs, including 22 deaths. The most frequently reported AEs were headache (n = 193), chills (n = 100), fatigue (n = 93), and amyloid-related imaging abnormality-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E) (n = 91). Safety signals were detected, such as headache (ROR: 10.4, 95%CI: 8.97, 12.07; IC: 3.25, 95%CI: 2.97, 3.40), ARIA-E (ROR: 18,299.69, 95%CI: 14,001.27, 23,917.73; IC: 13.37, 95%CI: 6.15, 6.87), and infusion-related reaction (ROR: 35.25, 95CI 27.58, 45.07; IC: 5.09, 95CI 4.15, 4.87). We also identified several new AEs, such as migraine and pancreatic carcinoma. Patients with serious AEs were more likely to be on polypharmacy for Alzheimer's disease and use aspirin, acid-suppressing medications, statins, antidepressants, or benzodiazepines compared to those with non-serious AEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab may have a significant potential for AEs. Our results provide evidence for healthcare professionals and patients to weigh the risks and benefits of lecanemab treatment. Further prospective studies are needed to explore rare and unexpected AEs.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39876754,Immune cells: Mediators in the metabolites and Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects elderly individuals across the globe. While genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors are known to influence the onset of AD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the intricate interplay between metabolites and immune cell activation in the ethology of AD, and to determine their collective impact on AD risk.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide association studies data to examine the relationships between metabolites, immune cell phenotypes, and the risk of AD. Our study encompassed a comprehensive examination involving 731 distinct immune cell types, 1400 metabolites, and a large cohort comprising10,520 AD cases with 401,661 controls. We employed univariate Mendelian randomization to assess bidirectional relationships between metabolites and AD, metabolites and immune cells, as well as immune cells and AD. Subsequently, multivariate Mendelian randomization was then applied to evaluate the potential mediating role of immune cells on the relationship between metabolites and AD.
RESULTS: Specific metabolites, the histidine/pyruvate ratio and homoarginine, were positively associated with the risk of AD, mediated by immune cells. Conversely, 4-hydroxycoumarin and glycolithocholate sulfate showed protective associations against AD. Immune cell markers, CD64 on monocytes and HLA DR on CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes were linked to higher AD risk, while CD33<sup>dim</sup> HLA DR<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> myeloid cells and HLA DR on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were protective.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of immune cells in the pathogenesis of AD, demonstrating how their interaction with specific metabolites influences disease risk.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39747370,Temporal ablation of the ciliary protein IFT88 alters normal brainwave patterns.,"The primary cilium is a hair-like organelle that hosts molecular machinery for various developmental and homeostatic signaling pathways. Its alteration can cause rare ciliopathies such as the Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndromes, but is also linked to Alzheimer's disease, clinical depression, and autism spectrum disorder. These afflictions are caused by disturbances in a wide variety of genes but a common phenotype amongst them is cognitive impairment. While cilia-mediated neural function has been widely examined in early neurodevelopment, their function in the adult brain is not well understood. To help elucidate the role of cilia in neural activity, we temporally induced the ablation of IFT88, a gene encoding the intraflagellar transport 88 protein which is neccessary for ciliogenesis, in adult mice before performing memory-related behavioral assays and electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) recordings. Inducible IFT88 KO mice exhibited severe learning deficits in trace fear conditioning and Morris water maze tests. They had strongly affected brainwave activity both under isoflurane induced anesthesia and during normal activity. And additionally, inducible IFT88 KO mice had altered sleep architecture and attenuated phase-amplitude coupling, a process that underlies learning and memory formation. These results highlight the growing significance of primary cilia for healthy neural function in the adult brain.",Sci Rep,2025

METHODS: To capture comprehensive data, the VMP integrates self-enrollment and automatic enrollment using Virginia's All-Payer Claims Database (APCD). It also adapts Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) modules for self-reported cognitive and caregiving data, offering connections to research, clinical services, and education.
RESULTS: Virginia successfully codified the VMP in the 2024 general assembly session.
DISCUSSION: The VMP demonstrates a novel approach to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) surveillance by combining traditional registry functions with community engagement and workforce development. Future efforts will focus on increasing enrollment, especially among underrepresented groups, to enhance data-driven dementia policy and care in Virginia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Integrated the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI) domains into the newest statewide epidemiological dementia registry in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Collected data and identified gaps in the current research related to dementia and Alzheimer's related diseases. Aimed to mitigate barriers to dementia registry enrollment by identifying significant underdiagnosis and underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority groups. Developed solutions to alleviate the current data and enrollment disparities and to connect individuals to research, physicians, and community groups.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39992249,The role of insulin resistance and APOE genotype on blood-brain barrier integrity in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence suggests a connection between insulin resistance and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but the mechanisms are unclear. We examined effects of insulin resistance and APOE genotype on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in AD.
METHODS: BBB integrity was measured in 196 biologically-confirmed non-diabetic patients with AD evaluating CSF/serum albumin ratio, kappa and lambda free light chains (FLCs). Insulin resistance was assessed using triglyceride-glucose index (TyG). The impact of TyG on BBB integrity, and its interaction with APOE genotypes, was analyzed using multivariate models.
RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of patients with AD showed altered TyG, with the 21.8% classified as high TyG. TyG subgroups were associated with BBB abnormalities, with similar AD clinical and biomarkers profile. A significant interaction between TyG and APOE ε4/ε4 genotype on BBB permeability was found in multivariate analyses.
DISCUSSION: Insulin resistance is a common feature in non-diabetic AD and correlates with altered BBB permeability, interacting synergistically with APOE genotype.
HIGHLIGHTS: Insulin resistance and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype are well-recognized risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin resistance shows high prevalence in patients with AD. Insulin resistance is related to damage in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. The association between the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and BBB permeability varies in relation to APOE genotype; patients with the APOE ε4/ε4 displayed higher BBB permeability.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40140924,Diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau217 in a memory clinic cohort using the Lumipulse automated platform.,"BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a promising tool for accessible and accurate biological diagnostics. However, data in clinical practice are needed to better understand their diagnostic and prognostic ability in memory unit patients.
METHODS: We analyzed plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) and neuroflament light chain (NfL) levels and AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a group of 493 subjects using the Lumipulse G600II platform. The sample includes 340 patients from our memory unit (142 dementia, 186 mild cognitive impairment, and 12 with subjective complaints) and 153 cognitively unimpaired volunteers. We have correlated plasma and CSF biomarkers; we have analyzed plasma biomarker levels as a function of clinical diagnosis, cognitive status and amyloid status. We have also studied the ability of p-tau217 to discriminate between amyloid-positive and -negative subjects according to CSF using receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 correlated significantly with CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 (Rho = -0.75; p-value < 0.001), p-tau181 (r = 0.66; p-value < 0.001), and t-tau (r = 0.59; p-value < 0.001). Plasma NfL correlated with CSF NfL (r = 0.48; p-value < 0.001). By clinical diagnosis, plasma p-tau217 levels showed to be higher in AD patients than in healthy controls (difference = 0.63 pg/ml; p-value < 0.001), FTD (difference = 0.60 pg/ml; p-value < 0.001), and nondegenerative dementias (difference = 0.61 pg/ml; p-value < 0.001). Plasma p-tau217 showed an area under the curve of 0.95 to discriminate between A + and A- subjects (95%CI 0.93-0.97).
CONCLUSION: Plasma p-tau217 shows excellent results for detecting amyloid pathology at brain level in a clinical setting with an AUC of 0.95. It is a highly specific marker of AD and increases progressively along the disease continuum. Using plasma p-tau217 as an initial diagnostic tool with cut-offs at sensitivities and specificities of 95 or 97.5% could save between 57.4-84.8% of LP/PETs with diagnostic accuracies of 95-97%. Plasma NfL increases progressively at different cognitive stages.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39686608,Item response theory for the color-picture version of Boston naming test in a Chinese sample with neurodegenerative diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Although Boston Naming Test has been thoroughly validated at a global level, there is limited assessment of item-level properties using modern psychometric methods.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the construct validity and item-level properties of the color-picture version of Boston Naming Test (CP-BNT) in a Chinese cohort with neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 424 participants, consisting of 118 normal controls, 152 with Alzheimer's disease, 101 with primary progressive aphasia, and 53 with other neurodegenerative diseases. All participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment that included the CP-BNT. Factor analysis and item response theory were conducted.
RESULTS: The CP-BNT exhibits a multidimensional structure with three factors: Factor 1, consisting of nine items with moderate difficulty levels, demonstrated peak measurement function for mild anomia (the highest information value = 33.7, ability estimated value = -0.8, reliability = 0.97); Factor 2, comprising eleven items with lower difficulty levels, performed well in cases of mild to moderate anomia (the highest information value = 34.1, ability estimated value = -1.2, reliability = 0.97); and Factor 3, including ten items with higher difficulty levels, provided the most measurement information for normal naming (the highest information value = 9.9, ability estimated value = 0, reliability = 0.90). All items, except item igloo, showed good discrimination (discrimination parameter ranged from 5.46 to 1.15). Most items had a different difficulty position versus the original version, thereby generating a novel item sequence with an ascending difficulty hierarchy for Chinese samples.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that the CP-BNT has good validity, reliability, and cultural appropriateness in the Chinese context, improving its utility in clinical assessments and interventions.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39748838,Alzheimer's disease drug development in an evolving therapeutic landscape.,"UNLABELLED: The Alzheimer's disease (AD) research field has entered a new era, where our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and advances in biomarkers have not only allowed for earlier, timely, and accurate detection and diagnosis of the disease, but that amyloid removal has been shown to be associated with signals of slowing cognitive and functional decline. Although recent FDA-approved amyloid plaque-lowering monoclonal antibody therapies have shifted the trajectory of AD, additional treatment options will be key to further slowing clinical decline or stopping disease progression. Thus, new and emerging therapies for AD have created an evolving therapeutic landscape. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Spring meeting held on May 23-34, 2023, brought together a broad array of scientific leaders from the AARR membership, academia, industry, and government and regulatory agencies to discuss the future of clinical trials in an era of regulator-approved amyloid-targeting therapies. Participants discussed lessons learned from other neurological diseases where disease-modifying treatments were first approved and key considerations for future clinical trials, for example, trial population real-world representativeness, duration, biomarker screening, efficacy endpoints, combination therapy, as well as overall trial design and the ethical and equity concerns that clinicians, patients, and their families face when considering clinical trial participation.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from industry and academia, as well as patients, clinicians, and government and regulatory agency scientists to discuss the topic, ""Alzheimer's Disease Drug Development in an Evolving Therapeutic Landscape.""While recently approved amyloid-targeting therapies show great promise in providing clinically meaningful outcomes for patients and families, additional treatments, and a better understanding of dosing and administration of these approved treatments, are needed to further slow and eventually prevent clinical decline in AD.Approved therapies will impact many aspects of clinical trial design including the use of placebo-controls, participant re-enrollment, safety monitoring, as well as biomarker selection.This exciting new era in AD research represents a hopeful future for clinicians, patients, and their care partners.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39985481,Human herpesvirus-associated transposable element activation in human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
METHODS: We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) dysregulation underlying AD etiologies.
RESULTS: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical validation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in real-world patient data.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39762947,"Depressive symptoms in older adults are associated with changes in stress-related markers, functional connectivity and brain volume.","BACKGROUND: Subclinical depressive symptoms increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this link may involve stress system dysfunction, notably related to the hippocampus which is particularly sensitive to AD. We aimed to investigate the links between blood stress markers and changes in brain regions involved in the stress response in older adults with or without subclinical depressive symptoms.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using baseline data from the Age-Well trial. Cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with (DepS; n = 73) or without (NoDepS; n = 58) subclinical depressive symptoms (defined using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) were included in the analyses. Blood cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured; as well as the resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) between, and gray matter (GM) volume of, the hypothalamus, hippocampus and hippocampal subfields. Blood stress markers levels and neuroimaging measures were compared between groups; then regression analyses were conducted between these measures.
RESULTS: DepS participants showed higher plasma epinephrine levels, which was associated with greater rs-FC between the CA1 and Subiculum hippocampal subfields and the hypothalamus. Lower GM volume in the CA1 and DG/CA2-3-4 subfields was also found in DepS. No between-group differences were observed for blood cortisol and norepinephrine.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that subclinical depressive symptoms are associated with increased sympatho-adrenomedullary axis activity, together with lower GM volume in a hippocampal subfield (i.e., CA1) particularly sensitive to AD. While causation cannot be inferred, these results suggest that screening and treating subclinical depressive symptoms in CU older adults could reduce AD risk.

39732509,Early midlife ovarian removal is associated with lower posterior hippocampal function.,"INTRODUCTION: Women with early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) have greater Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk than women with spontaneous menopause (SM), but the pathway toward this risk is understudied. Considering associative memory deficits may reflect early signs of AD, we studied how BSO affected brain activity underlying associative memory.
METHODS: Early midlife women with BSO (with and without 17β-estradiol therapy [ET]) and age-matched controls (AMCs) with intact ovaries completed a face-name associative memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Hippocampal activity along the anteroposterior axis during associative encoding and retrieval was compared among three groups (BSO [n = 28], BSO+ET [n = 35], AMCs [n = 40]).
RESULTS: Both BSO groups (with and without ET) showed lower posterior hippocampal activation during encoding compared to the AMC group. However, this difference in activation was not significantly correlated with associative memory task performance.
DISCUSSION: Early 17β-estradiol loss may influence posterior hippocampal activity during associative encoding, possibly presaging late-life AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: After ovarian removal, changes in hippocampal function may affect dementia risk. Midlife ovarian removal is associated with less activation in the posterior hippocampus. Estradiol therapy may ameliorate alterations in brain function during learning.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40101271,EEG biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: A novel automated pipeline for detecting and monitoring disease progression.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that profoundly alters brain function and organization. Currently, there is a lack of validated functional biomarkers to aid in diagnosing and classifying AD. Therefore, there is a pressing need for early, accurate, non-invasive, and accessible methods to detect and characterize disease progression. Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a minimally invasive technique to quantify functional changes in neural activity associated with AD. However, challenges such as poor signal-to-noise ratio-particularly for resting-state (rsEEG) recordings-and issues with standardization have hindered its broader application.ObjectiveTo conduct a pilot analysis of our custom automated preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline to identify indicators of AD and correlates of disease progression.MethodsWe analyzed data from 36 individuals with AD and 29 healthy participants recorded using a standard 19-channel EEG and features were processed using our custom end-t-end pipeline. Various features encompassing amplitude, power, connectivity, complexity, and microstates were extracted. Unsupervised machine learning (uniform manifold approximation and projection) and supervised learning (random forest classifiers with nested cross-validation) were used to characterize the dataset and identify differences between AD and healthy groups.ResultsOur pipeline successfully detected several new and previously established EEG-based measures indicative of AD status and progression, demonstrating strong external validity.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that this automated approach provides a promising initial framework for implementing EEG biomarkers in the AD patient population, paving the way for improved diagnostic and monitoring strategies.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40084669,Salivary biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies.,"BackgroundDespite dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) being the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, more than 80% of DLB cases are initially misdiagnosed. Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and tau species have been detected in peripheral tissues and biological fluids of DLB patients and among different biological fluids, saliva represent an easely accessible and non-invasive source for biomarker detection.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate salivary a-syn and tau species as molecular disease biomarkers, assessing their potential in the diagnosis of DLB and in the differential diagnosis on respect to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).MethodsWe measured total and oligomeric a-syn, total-tau, and S199-phosphorylated-tau (pS199-tau) in the saliva of 21 DLB, 20 AD, 20 PD patients, and 20 healthy subjects (HS) using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses.ResultsSalivary total a-syn was not significantly changed between the different groups, whereas all pathological groups had a higher oligomeric a-syn concentration than HS. Salivary total-tau concentration was higher in all the pathological groups than HS, whereas the concentrations did not differ among patients' groups. Conversely, salivary levels of pS199-tau was higher in DLB and AD patients than in HS and PD patients. Both correlation matrix and principal component analysis showed that core clinical DLB features were related to a-syn pathology, while cognitive decline was associated with salivary levels of pS199-tau in both DLB and AD patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis reported high diagnostic accuracy for both a-syn oligomers and pS199-tau, between DLB and HS, and an adequate accuracy between DLB and PD. Conversely, the diagnostic accuracy was not optimal between DLB patients and AD patients.ConclusionsThese findings provide preliminary evidence that salivary a-syn and tau species might be promising in identifying DLB patients on respect to PD patients and HS, while the diagnostic potential is limited on respect to AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40065919,Blood-based biomarker prescreening with different testing combinations and cutoffs: A simulation study examining efficacy and cost-effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease prevention studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), including plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) or phosphorylated tau (p-tau), combined with apolipoprotein E (APOE) testing, are anticipated to serve as prescreening tools before amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) for recruiting participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention studies. The predictive efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prescreening may vary with different testing combinations, sequences, and cutoff levels.
METHODS: We conducted a simulation study utilizing data from our ongoing Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort (J-TRC) onsite study (n = 202) recruited online. We included cognitively unimpaired individuals who had undergone amyloid PET, APOE genotyping, and evaluation of BBBMs (i.e., plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, plasma p-tau217, and plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio). We examined 14 different prescreening models incorporating APOE genotype and/or BBBMs with varied combinations and cutoff levels. Models were evaluated for predictive performance (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value [PPV]) and cost-effectiveness (cost per identified amyloid-positive case) across varied testing costs and the prevalence of amyloid positivity.
RESULTS: Applying BBBM prescreening significantly decreased sensitivity and increased specificity and PPV compared to the no-prescreening scenario. Although no single model was superior in all performance metrics, a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity was observed. Generalized linear models (GLMs) simultaneously incorporating plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and p-tau217 showed a balanced efficacy (the best level of improvement in number needed to screen (NNS) but modest worsening in sensitivity) and the best level of cost-effectiveness compared to other models, although there were substantial overlaps in their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The minimum-required PET/BBBM cost ratio to achieve improved cost-effectiveness by employing the prescreening process was negatively associated with the background prevalence of amyloid positivity.
DISCUSSION: The choice of prescreening strategy in AD prevention studies/trials should be tailored to specific trial requirements, considering the relative importance of sensitivity versus cost-effectiveness, local testing cost environments, and background population characteristics.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated different models of blood-based biomarker (BBBM) prescreening.Data from Japanese Trial-Ready Cohort Study were used for simulation.BBBM reduced the number needed to screen with positron emission tomography (PET) but decreased the sensitivity.The cost-effectiveness improved with a higher PET/BBBM cost ratio.No single model was optimal for all scenarios.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39910474,Influence of immune cells and inflammatory factors on Alzheimer's disease axis: evidence from mediation Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia in the elderly, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. While the exact etiology of AD remains unclear, immune inflammation is known to play a significant role in the disease.
METHODS: This study utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the causal relationship between different types of immune cells and AD, while considering inflammatory factors as intermediate variables. Data were collected from three sources: immune cell data (731 phenotypes), inflammatory factors (48 cytokines from 8,293 individuals), and AD data (35,274 cases, 59,163 controls). Multiple MR methods were employed to minimize bias, and detailed descriptions of instrumental variable selection and statistical methods were provided.
RESULTS: The study findings suggest potential causal relationships between six different types of immune cells and AD, as well as causal relationships between 13 immune cells and inflammatory factors. Additionally, two statistically significant inflammatory factors were found to have potential causal relationships with AD. Specifically, immune cells CD33-HLA DR + and CD45 on CD33-HLA DR + may further influence AD by regulating Interleukin-2 levels.
CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into the immunoinflammatory pathogenesis of AD and offers partial guidance for the development of relevant interventions, thereby contributing beneficial information for the prevention and treatment of related diseases.",BMC Neurol,2025
39967687,Enhancing the utility of polygenic scores in Alzheimer's disease through systematic curation and annotation.,"INTRODUCTION: Polygenic Scores (PGSs) assess cumulative genetic risk variants that contribute to the association with complex diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The PGS Catalog is a valuable repository of PGSs of various complex diseases, but it lacks standardized annotations and harmonization, making the information difficult to integrate for a specific disease.
METHODS: In this study, we curated 44 PGS datasets for AD from the PGS Catalog, categorized them into five methodological groups, and annotated 813,257 variants to nearby genes. We aligned the scores based on the ""GWAS significant variants"" (GWAS-SV) method with the GWAS Catalog and flagged redundant files and those with a ""limited scope"" due to insufficient external GWAS support. Using rank aggregation (RA), we prioritized consistently important variants and provided an R package, ""PgsRankRnnotatR,"" to automate this process.
RESULTS: Of the six RA methods evaluated, ""Dowdall"" method was the most robust. Our refined dataset, enhanced by multiple RA options, is a valuable resource for AD researchers selecting PGSs or exploring AD-related genetic variants.
DISCUSSION: Our approach offers a framework for curating, harmonizing, and prioritizing PGS datasets, improving their usability for AD research. By integrating multiple RA methods and automating the process, we provide a flexible tool that enhances PGS selection and genetic variant exploration. This framework can be extended to other complex diseases or traits, facilitating broader applications in genetic risk assessment.",Front Genet,2025
39784954,Autophagy intersection: Unraveling the role of the SNARE complex in lysosomal fusion in Alzheimer's disease.,"Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process critical for maintaining neuronal health, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review explores the intricate role of the SNARE complex in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a crucial step in autophagic flux. Disruptions in this fusion process, often resulting from aberrant SNARE complex function or impaired lysosomal acidification, contribute to the pathological accumulation of autophagosomes and lysosomes observed in AD. We examine the composition, regulation, and interacting molecules of the SNARE complex, emphasizing its central role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, we discuss the potential impact of specific SNARE protein mutations and the broader implications for neuronal health and disease progression. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying SNARE-mediated autophagic fusion, we aim to highlight therapeutic targets that could restore autophagic function and mitigate the neurodegenerative processes characteristic of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40032716,The Peripheral Amyloid-β Nexus: Connecting Alzheimer's Disease with Atherosclerosis through Shared Pathophysiological Mechanisms.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherosclerosis (AS) are two chronic diseases with seemingly distinct pathologies. However, emerging research points to a bidirectional relationship driven by common mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of Amyloid-Beta (Aβ). This review focuses on the role of Aβ as a critical molecular link between AD and AS, emphasizing its contribution to neuronal impairment and vascular damage. Specifically, peripheral Aβ produced in the pancreas and skeletal muscle tissues exacerbates AS by promoting endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance (IR). Furthermore, AS accelerates AD progression by impairing cerebral blood flow and inducing chronic hypoxia, causing Aβ accumulation. This review critically evaluates recent findings, highlighting inconsistencies in clinical studies and suggesting future research directions. Understanding the bidirectional influence of AD and AS could pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting shared molecular pathways, particularly emphasizing Aβ clearance and inflammation.",Neuromolecular Med,2025
40189700,Expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in human brain and its association with Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19.,"It is known that infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is widely reported that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality. However, it remains largely unclear about the link between AD and COVID-19. ACE2 is an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We consider that there may be a link between AD and COVID-19 through the expression of ACE2. Here, we summarize recent findings about the ACE2 expression especially in AD and COVID-19, and shows that (1) ACE2 shows mRNA and protein expression in human brain tissues, especially in neurons and non-neuron cells; (2) low ACE2 mRNA and protein expression are sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human brain through the neural route (olfactory and/or vagal) and the hematogenous route; (3) SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein were detected in brains of COVID-19 patients; (4) SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in human brain dependent on ACE2; (5) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load shows a positive association with ACE2 mRNA levels and COVID-19 severity; (6) ACE2 shows increased expression in AD compared with controls in human brain; (7) ACE2 shows increased expression in COVID-19 compared with controls in human brain; (8) ACE2 expression levels affect COVID-19 outcomes. Together, ACE2 shows significantly increased mRNA and protein expression in AD compared with controls in human brain. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with SARS-CoV-2, and play a role in the context of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the expression of ACE2 may partly explain the link of AD with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
39744519,Hippocampal SIRT1 signaling mediates the ameliorative effect of treadmill exercise on anxiety- and depression-like behavior in APP/PS1 mice.,"OBJECTIVE: Anxiety and depression-like symptoms occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling mediates anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Exercise training improves anxiety and depression-like behavior in various disease models, such as the rat chronic restraint stress model, rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder, and rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate whether exercise ameliorates anxiety- and depression like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice and explore the potential mechanisms.
METHODS: After eight weeks of exercise intervention, we assessed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. We then measured the levels of SIRT1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and mitochondrial biogenesis (CO2, ATP6, and mitochondrial content) using immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR, and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we investigated the effects of pharmacological activation of SIRT1 on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, the SIRT1/PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM signaling axis, and mitochondrial biogenesis.
RESULTS: We first observed that treadmill exercise improved anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in six-month-old APP/PS1 mice and increased SIRT1 levels in the hippocampus. Pharmacological activation of hippocampal SIRT1 function also reduced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Meanwhile, both treadmill exercise and pharmacological activation of hippocampal SIRT1 increased the levels of PGC1α, NRF1, TFAM, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis (CO2, ATP6, or mitochondrial content) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that treadmill exercise reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in six-month-old APP/PS1 mice by enhancing the SIRT1-dependent PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM axis, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in the hippocampus.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39773275,CDPMF-DDA: contrastive deep probabilistic matrix factorization for drug-disease association prediction.,"The process of new drug development is complex, whereas drug-disease association (DDA) prediction aims to identify new therapeutic uses for existing medications. However, existing graph contrastive learning approaches typically rely on single-view contrastive learning, which struggle to fully capture drug-disease relationships. Subsequently, we introduce a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework, named CDPMF-DDA, which enhances the model's ability to capture drug-disease associations by incorporating diverse information representations from different views. First, we decompose the original drug-disease association matrix into drug and disease feature matrices, which are then used to reconstruct the drug-disease association network, as well as the drug-drug and disease-disease similarity networks. This process effectively reduces noise in the data, establishing a reliable foundation for the networks produced. Next, we generate multiple contrastive views from both the original and generated networks. These views effectively capture hidden feature associations, significantly enhancing the model's ability to represent complex relationships. Extensive cross-validation experiments on three standard datasets show that CDPMF-DDA achieves an average AUC of 0.9475 and an AUPR of 0.5009, outperforming existing models. Additionally, case studies on Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy further validate the model's effectiveness, demonstrating its high accuracy and robustness in drug-disease association prediction. Based on a multi-view contrastive learning framework, CDPMF-DDA is capable of integrating multi-source information and effectively capturing complex drug-disease associations, making it a powerful tool for drug repositioning and the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.",BMC Bioinformatics,2025

Studying the development of brain changes prior to symptoms onset may lead to early diagnostic biomarkers and a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Alzheimer's disease pathology is thought to arise from a combination of protein accumulation and spreading via neural connections, but how these processes influence brain atrophy progression in the pre-symptomatic phases remains unclear. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (FHAD) have an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease, providing an opportunity to study the pre-symptomatic phase. Here, we used structural MRI from three databases (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer Disease and Montreal Adult Lifespan Study) to map atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease and assess the constraining effects of structural connectivity on atrophy progression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data up to 4 years were used to perform atrophy progression analysis in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. PET radiotracers were also used to quantify the distribution of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta protein isoforms at baseline. We first derived cortical atrophy progression maps using deformation-based morphometry from 153 FHAD, 156 Alzheimer's disease and 116 controls with similar age, education and sex at baseline. We next examined the spatial relationship between atrophy progression and spatial patterns of tau aggregates and amyloid-beta plaques deposition, structural connectivity and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. Our results show that there were similar patterns of atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease, notably in the cingulate, temporal and parietal cortices, with more widespread and severe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. Both tau and amyloid-beta pathology tended to accumulate in regions that were structurally connected in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease. The pattern of atrophy and its progression also aligned with existing structural connectivity in FHAD. In Alzheimer's disease, our findings suggest that atrophy progression results from pathology propagation that occurred earlier, on a previously intact connectome. Moreover, a relationship was found between serotonin receptor spatial distribution and atrophy progression in Alzheimer's disease. The current study demonstrates that regions showing atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease present with specific connectivity and cellular characteristics, uncovering some of the mechanisms involved in pre-clinical and clinical neurodegeneration.",Brain Commun,2025
39994734,Hippocampal mitophagy alterations in MAPT-associated frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism.,"The enzyme pair PINK1 and PRKN together orchestrates a cytoprotective mitophagy pathway that selectively tags damaged mitochondria with phospho-serine 65 ubiquitin (pS65-Ub) and directs them for autophagic-lysosomal degradation (mitophagy). We previously demonstrated a significant accumulation of pS65-Ub signals in autopsy brains of sporadic Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease cases, which strongly correlated with early tau pathology. In this study, we extended our analysis to a series of pathologically confirmed cases of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) harboring different pathogenic mutations in MAPT, the gene encoding tau. We assessed the morphology, levels, and distribution of the mitophagy tag pS65-Ub in several affected brain regions and hippocampal subregions of these cases. While tau pathological burden was similarly increased across all FTDP-17 cases, pS65-Ub immunopositive signals were strongly accumulated in P301L cases and only weakly present in N279K cases. In the hippocampus of both mutation groups, the density of pS65-Ub positive cells was overall the greatest in the dentate gyrus followed by the subiculum, CA1, and CA2/3, with the CA4 showing only minimal presence. Notably, positive cells in the subiculum carried greater numbers and particularly vacuolar pS65-Ub structures, while cells in the dentate gyrus mostly contained fewer and rather granular pS65-Ub inclusions. Single cell analyses revealed differential co-localization of pS65-Ub with mitochondria, autophagosomes, and lysosomes in these two regions. Together, our study demonstrates distinct mitophagy alteration in different FTDP-17 MAPT cases and hint at selective organelle failure in the hippocampal subregions that was associated with the P301L mutation.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
40089165,Vascular models of Alzheimer's disease: An overview of recent in vitro models of the blood-brain barrier.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains an overwhelming epidemiologic and economic burden on our healthcare systems, affecting an estimate of 11 % of individuals aged 65 years and older. Increasing evidence of the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in AD pathology lends support to the vascular hypothesis of AD, which posits that damage to cerebral vasculature and impairments to cerebral blood flow are major contributors to neurodegeneration in AD. While the question remains whether the dysfunction of the BBB is the cause or consequence of the disease, understanding of the relationship between vascular pathology and AD is growing increasingly complex, warranting the need for better tools to study vasculature in AD. This review provides an overview of AD models in the context of studying vascular impairments and their relevance in pathology. Specifically, we summarize opportunities in in vitro models, cell sources, and phenotypic observations in sporadic and familial forms of AD. Further, we describe recent advances in generating models which recapitulate in vivo characteristics of the BBB in AD through the use of microfluidics, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and organoid technologies. Finally, we provide a searchable database of reported cell-based models of pathogenic AD gene variants.",Neurobiol Dis,2025

40191787,Significance of nicotine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the aggregation of α-synuclein. According to epidemiological data, PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has emerged as a significant global health concern. This review examines the intricate pathological mechanisms and high-risk factors associated with PD, and discusses the challenges in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. We elucidate the relationship between smoking and the reduced risk of PD, highlighting the potential neuroprotective effects of nicotine present in tobacco. The interaction between nicotine and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is analyzed in detail, emphasizing their neuroprotective capabilities and underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we analyze the structural and functional diversity of nAChRs and their roles in the pathological progression of PD. Our review aims to elucidate the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and biochemical factors in PD and to propose future research directions that may facilitate therapeutic development.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39838927,Mitochondria-Related Genome-Wide Mendelian Randomization Identifies Putatively Causal Genes for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondria-related genes. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets for these diseases through a comprehensive analysis that integrated genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) with genes associated with mitochondrial function.
METHODS: Using existing publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and comprehensive data on 1136 mitochondria-related genes, we initially identified a subset of genes related to mitochondrial function that exhibited significant associations with NDDs. We then conducted colocalization and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to validate the causal role of these candidate genes. Additionally, we assessed the druggability of the encoded proteins to prioritize potential therapeutic targets for further exploration.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted levels of 10 genes were found to be significantly associated with the risk of NDDs. Elevated DMPK and LACTB2 levels were associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk. Higher expression of NDUFAF2, BCKDK, and MALSU1, along with lower TTC19, raised Parkinson's disease risk. Higher ACLY levels were associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, while decreased MCL1, TOP3A, and VWA8 levels raised MS risk. These genes primarily impact mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Notably, several druggable protein targets identified are being explored for potential NDDs treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This data-driven MR study demonstrated the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in NDDs. Additionally, this study identified candidate genes that could serve as potential pharmacological targets for the prevention and treatment of NDDs. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Mov Disord,2025
39946349,Characterizing plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers relevant to neurodegeneration in captive olive baboons (Papio anubis).,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a significant global disease burden that is only expected to grow in the future. As such, there is a need to develop and investigate biomarkers that identify individuals at risk of developing ADRD with the goal of providing early interventions and treatments. Non-human primate (NHP) models of neurodegeneration present opportunities to examine such biomarkers in a preclinical model with the ability to control several confounding factors present in research with humans. Baboons naturally develop several ADRD-related neuropathologies that humans also exhibit, including age-related tau and amyloid deposition. However, to our knowledge, there are no data characterizing fluid biomarkers relevant to neurodegeneration or ADRD in baboons. We collected plasma (N = 139) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, N = 44) from captive baboons ranging in age from 3-19 years old. We characterized biomarkers as a function of age, sex, and rearing status in baboons using a bead-based bioplex human assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific's Neuroscience 18-Plex Human ProcartaPlex™ Panel). Fluid biomarkers were more detectable in CSF compared to plasma. Additionally, while sex and rearing did not significantly predict biomarkers in baboons, age significantly predicted levels of eight of the 12 biomarkers detected in the assay. Linear regressions showed that CSF levels of total tau, pTau181, NGF-beta, GFAP, NF-H, and S100B were higher in older baboons, as were plasma levels of NGF-beta. Lastly, older baboons showed a higher incidence of co-occurrence of multiple biomarkers as measured in CSF, but not in plasma. These data show that baboons exhibit age-dependent changes in biomarkers used in humans for clinical screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of ADRD, thereby further demonstrating the value of baboons as a model of aging and, possibly, ADRD.",PLoS One,2025

This study aims to explore these regions using high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the goal of identifying reliable biomarkers based on histopathological observations.
METHODS: Twenty post mortem brain specimens were scanned with 11.7T MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, and were cut for subsequent histological examinations. The entorhinal cortical thickness and number of PP fibers derived from MRI were compared across neuropathological and premortem clinical diagnoses of AD.
RESULTS: The entorhinal cortical thickness and number of PP fibers decreased along with severities of neurofibrillary tangles in the ERC. Meanwhile, a reduction in the number of PP fibers, but not the entorhinal cortical thickness, was observed during the preclinical stage of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Degeneration of PP fibers was observed in early AD and progressed along with neuropathological changes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Twenty post mortem brain tissues were scanned with 11.7T MRI. Degeneration of PP fibers was observed at 250 µm isotropic resolution. PP fiber indices were linked with severities of NFTs. The number of PP fibers was decreased in preclinical AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40002547,Cholinesterase Inhibitors from Plants and Their Potential in Alzheimer's Treatment: Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, primarily due to dysfunction of acetylcholine caused by acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. While synthetic cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are commonly used, they have notable side effects, prompting interest in natural alternatives. Medicinal plants, rich in bioactive compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids, have shown potential as cholinesterase inhibitors with additional antioxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the cholinesterase-inhibiting effects of various plant species and their compounds to identify new therapeutic candidates and reduce side effects.
METHOD: A PRISMA-compliant review was conducted, screening studies from multiple databases, with a final inclusion of 64 in vivo studies.
RESULTS: These studies highlighted plant extracts such as Ferula ammoniacum, Elaeagnus umbellata, Bacopa monnieri, and Centella asiatica, which improved memory, reduced oxidative stress, and provided neuroprotection. Some extracts also reduced amyloid plaques, enhanced neuronal integrity, and restored cholinesterase activity, indicating their potential as therapeutic agents for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the promise of plant-based compounds in treating cognitive decline and cholinergic dysfunction in AD, advocating for further research into their therapeutic potential.",Brain Sci,2025

39711511,Proteomic signatures of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementias: A comparative analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to identify unique proteomic signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).
METHODS: We conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of 33 post mortem brains from AD, DLB, and PDD individuals without dementia focusing on prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal cortices, using weighted gene co-expression network analyses with differential enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: Network modules revealed hub proteins common to all dementias. Lewy body dementias differed from AD by reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1), whereas DLB was distinguished from both AD and PDD by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) across brain regions. An increase in mitochondrial and synaptic proteins was related to better cognition whereas enrichment in the extracellular matrix, complement system, and autophagy proteins was associated with greater cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Our study offers valuable insights into the network-based biomarker characterization of molecular signatures of AD, DLB, and PDD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Reduced levels of the autophagy protein p62 (SQSTM1) differentiated Lewy body dementias from Alzheimer's disease (AD) across multiple brain regions. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was distinguished from both AD and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) by altered TRIM33 and cysteine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) levels across brain regions. Key mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins (e.g., COX7A2, TOMM40L, NDUFV1), and synaptic proteins (e.g., GABRB3, GABRB2, GLUA3, GLUA4, SNAP47, dynamin1) were more abundant in preserved cognitive states. Extracellular matrix proteins and members of the complement system (decorin, biglycan, C4A, C4B) showed a strong positive correlation with cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39966328,The Abnormal ERα-miRNA Cross-Talk in AD-Affected Human Hippocampus: A Bioinformatics Perspective.,"Estrogen's impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifaceted, with its receptors potentially influencing AD pathology in both beneficial and detrimental ways. This study aims to dissect the intricate cross-talk between estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD-affected human hippocampus. Through a comprehensive literature review in the PubMed database, coupled with a GeneCards database search, we obtained AD-related key miRNAs and genes in the hippocampus. Using bioinformatics tools, we predicted target genes and miRNAs of ERα, and the targets of the identified miRNAs. The integration of these elements resulted in the construction of an ERα-related FFL network, which includes 13 miRNAs and 56 core genes. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted, revealing significant enrichment in biological processes such as neuron death and response to metal ions, and cellular components like membrane microdomains. Notably, the AKT-associated signaling pathway was prominently highlighted, with key genes including GSK3A, CDKN1A, AKT2, and MDM2, and key miRNAs including miR-485 and let-7f, suggesting a potential role of ERα in modulating this pathway in AD. The findings of this study provide a novel perspective on the regulatory network of ERα in the hippocampal region of AD and may pave the way for future research into the therapeutic potential of targeting the ERα pathway in neurodegenerative diseases.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39849529,Emerging targets of α-synuclein spreading in α-synucleinopathies: a review of mechanistic pathways and interventions.,"α-Synucleinopathies constitute a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), and Alzheimer's disease concurrent with LBD (AD-LBD). These disorders are unified by a pathological hallmark: aberrant misfolding and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn). This review delves into the pivotal role of α-syn, the key agent in α-synucleinopathy pathophysiology, and provides a survey of potential therapeutics that target cell-to-cell spread of pathologic α-syn. Recognizing the intricate complexity and multifactorial etiology of α-synucleinopathy, the review illuminates the potential of various membrane receptors, proteins, intercellular spreading pathways, and pathological agents for therapeutic interventions. While significant progress has been made in understanding α-synucleinopathy, the pursuit of efficacious treatments remains challenging. Several strategies involving decreasing α-syn production and aggregation, increasing α-syn degradation, lowering extracellular α-syn, and inhibiting cellular uptake of α-syn are presented. The paper underscores the necessity of meticulous and comprehensive investigations to advance our knowledge of α-synucleinopathy pathology and ultimately develop innovative therapeutic strategies for α-synucleinopathies.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39711072,Overview of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and future clinical trials.,"The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is to optimize and validate biomarkers for clinical trials while sharing all data and biofluid samples with the global scientific community.

39748836,Designing and implementing the IDEAL Study: A randomized clinical trial of APOE genotype disclosure for late-onset Alzheimer's disease in an urban Latino population.,"INTRODUCTION: The Información de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer para Latinos (IDEAL) Study is a randomized clinical trial investigating the psychosocial, behavioral, and cognitive impacts of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype disclosure for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) among Latinos.
METHODS: We used address-based sampling to recruit English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos aged 40-64 living in northern Manhattan for a community-based Baseline Survey about their knowledge and opinions about AD. Participants eligible for the clinical trial were invited to complete an Introductory Session, including AD and genetics education and informed consent, before undergoing genotyping for APOE. Participants were then randomized to learn their risk of AD by age 85 (range: 21%-55%) based on either Latino ethnicity and family history alone, or the same factors and their APOE genotype. Risk information is provided in a semi-structured genetic counseling session. Psychological impacts, health-related behavioral changes, and cognitive performance are evaluated 6 weeks, 9 months, and 15 months later via surveys and qualitative interviews. To promote cultural competence, study materials were developed by a multidisciplinary team including bilingual and bicultural staff, Latinx content experts, and genetic counselors.
RESULTS: We sent invitations to 91,433 households; 5542 (6.1%) responded, 2120 completed the Baseline Survey (78.5% online; 21.5% via computer-assisted telephone interview), and 2087 were deemed eligible, yielding a response rate of 2.3%. Many participants expressed appreciation for the opportunity to contribute to AD research. We randomized 374 participants for the clinical trial.
DISCUSSION: We describe the study design, recruitment and retention strategies, and interventions employed in the IDEAL Study. Our design provides a framework for future studies using rigorous mixed methods. Our findings may facilitate the development of culturally-sensitive educational materials about AD and genetic testing, as well as genetic counseling protocols, to improve coping and adjustment in response to receiving risk information.

39764140,Targeting NLRP3 signaling with a novel sulfonylurea compound for the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia.,"BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and VaD + AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) on the 50<sup>th</sup> day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples were collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration, expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling pathways, tight junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels, while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.",Res Sq,2024
40109019,Tau degradation in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau undergoes abnormal post-translational modifications and aggregations. Impaired intracellular degradation pathways further exacerbate the accumulation of pathological tau. A new strategy - targeted protein degradation - recently emerged as a modality in drug discovery where bifunctional molecules bring the target protein close to the degradation machinery to promote clearance. Since 2016, this strategy has been applied to tau pathologies and attracted broad interest in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. However, a systematic review of recent studies on tau degradation mechanisms is lacking. Here we review tau degradation mechanisms (the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway), their dysfunction in AD, and tau-targeted degraders, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras and autophagy-targeting chimeras. We emphasize the need for a continuous exploration of tau degradation mechanisms and provide a future perspective for developing tau-targeted degraders, encouraging researchers to work on new treatment options for AD patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Post-translational modifications, aggregation, and mutations affect tau degradation. A vicious circle exists between impaired degradation pathways and tau pathologies. Ubiquitin plays an important role in complex degradation pathways. Tau-targeted degraders provide promising strategies for novel AD treatment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40156243,Unraveling temporal patterns of diagnostic markers and comorbidities in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from large-scale data.,"INTRODUCTION: Comorbid conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood regarding timing and potential impact on disease onset and progression.
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV electronic health records from 2008 to 2019 were examined. The study identified 2527 AD patients (34.9% male, mean age 80.27 years) among 299,712 patients. We examined the timing of 12 cardiovascular and metabolic diseases relative to AD diagnosis. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center validated the findings.
RESULTS: Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, diagnosed 1.09 years before AD. Depression was the only comorbidity diagnosed after AD start, 0.16 years on average. AD patients had greater rates of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and depression compared to the general population.
DISCUSSION: The findings emphasize early detection and therapy of AD-related comorbidities, notably cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The temporal link between these diseases and AD suggests opportunities for preventive strategies and improved care pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Temporal analysis of comorbidities: The study reveals hypertension and hyperlipidemia as leading precursors to AD, typically diagnosed 1 to 1.3 years prior to AD onset, while depression emerges predominantly after diagnosis. Unique data integration: Large-scale datasets from MIMIC-IV (n = 299,712) and NACC (n = 51,836) were leveraged to identify chronological patterns in 12 key comorbid conditions relative to AD diagnosis. Sex- and age-specific insights: AD prevalence peaks at 80 to 86 years, with females exhibiting higher rates of LOAD compared to males. Depression as a post-diagnostic marker: Unlike other comorbidities, depression's post-diagnostic mean onset (0.16 years after AD diagnosis) highlights the need for targeted mental health interventions in AD patients. Implications for early detection: Findings suggest that managing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other modifiable conditions in midlife may delay or reduce the risk of AD development. Comorbidity variability across cohorts: Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia showed significantly higher prevalence in the NACC cohort compared to MIMIC-IV, reflecting potential dataset-specific biases or regional healthcare differences. Future research directions: Advocates for longitudinal, multiethnic, and global studies to refine early diagnostic criteria and explore preventive strategies tailored to comorbid conditions.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40042515,Parkinsonism in Alzheimer's disease without Lewy bodies in association with nigral neuron loss: A data-driven clinicopathologic study.,"INTRODUCTION: Parkinsonism in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often attributed to Lewy-related pathology, given its high comorbidity. In the era of anti-amyloid therapy, recognizing parkinsonism caused by AD pathology is needed to optimize the treatment.
METHODS: This study aimed to quantitatively characterize parkinsonism and nigral neuropathology in AD without Lewy bodies (LB). Nigral neurons were counted automatically. Fine-tuned ChatGPT collected structured clinical data.
RESULTS: Among 635 AD patients without LB, 62 (9.7%) presented parkinsonism, which correlated with reduced nigral neuron density (p < 0.01). Tau burden did not explain the nigral neuronal loss. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology correlated with reduced nigral pigmented neuron density (p = 0.03).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that parkinsonism in AD without LB is related to nigral neuronal loss in association with TDP-43 pathology. Recognition of parkinsonism in AD without LB is crucial for appropriate therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: One in 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients without Lewy bodies had parkinsonism. Parkinsonism in AD was correlated with reduced nigral neuron density. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathology was associated with nigral degeneration in AD. AD should be included in the differential diagnosis of dementia with parkinsonism.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

Alterations in GAP-43 levels have been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), potentially reflecting synaptic dysfunction. We evaluated the potential of GAP-43 as a biomarker for AD and explored its association with amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels, as well as its correlation with Aβ plaque burden in the brain.
METHODS: We screened 1,639 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. A total of 226 individuals met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled. Participants were classified into three groups: 77 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 111 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 38 with a diagnosis of AD. The associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels with other biomarkers as well as [¹⁸F] AV-45 (Florbetapir) PET Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR) were investigated.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed significantly elevated CSF GAP-43 levels in individuals with AD compared to CN and MCI groups. Furthermore, GAP-43 levels showed a significant positive correlation with tau pathology. Notably, we observed a significant association between GAP-43 and [¹⁸F] Florbetapir PET SUVR in the MCI group, suggesting that GAP-43 may serve as a reliable biomarker in the early stages of AD.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence supporting the role of GAP-43 as a potential biomarker for AD, particularly in relation to predicting the amyloid pathology pattern in the brain in the MCI stage.",BMC Neurol,2025
39924880,Genetic and biomarker disclosure process in a memory and aging study.,"Despite growing awareness that disclosing biomarker results to research participants is aligned with ethical principles of researcher-participant partnership, there are currently no widely adopted guidelines for this disclosure in Alzheimer's disease research. We developed a process and tools to deliver biomarker and genetic results to 65 participants of The Memory and Aging Study of the Duke-UNC Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Survey responses of 46 participants were analyzed. We show high participant satisfaction and lower anxiety levels after receiving the results.

40188157,Circadian rhythm disturbances in Alzheimer's disease: insights from plaque-free and plaque-burdened stages in APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>dE9</sub> mice.,"BACKGROUND: Disruptions in circadian rhythms are commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and could potentially accelerate the progression of the condition. However, the relationship between circadian rhythm disruptions and AD development, as well as the mechanisms involved, remain poorly understood.
METHODS: This study investigated the circadian behavior, rhythmic gene expression in multiple brain regions, and its correlation with sleep architecture of AD mice at two disease stages: plaque-free stage (2-month-old) and plaque-burdened stage (10-month-old) as compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) mice.
RESULTS: Two-month-old AD mice already displayed alteration in the activity patterns compared to WT mice, showing increased activity during the light phase and decreased activity during the dark phase, and the change in the activity pattern of 10-month-old AD mice was more significant. Further, electroencephalogram (EEG) examination showed increased wakefulness and reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in 2- and 10-month-old AD mice. In addition, we documented a significant change in circadian core clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), hippocampus, and cortex of 2- and 10-month-old AD mice. Correlation analyses demonstrated the close relationship between circadian clock gene expression level and specific sleep-wake parameters, especially within the SCN and hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that circadian rhythm disturbances in AD mice preceded Aβ deposition. The circadian rhythm disturbances observed in the early AD might be attributed to the abnormal expression of core clock genes in the brain regions involved in circadian rhythm regulation.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39716787,Apathy Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Apathy is a multidimensional and complex disease that is the primary neuropsychiatric symptom among those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, apathy in AD is sometimes underestimated.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search utilized specific keywords related to apathy and Alzheimer's disease (e.g., ""apathy,"" ""Alzheimer's disease,"" ""neuropsychiatric symptoms,"" ""front-striatal circuitry""). The studies were selected based on pre-defined criteria, including publication date (within the last 10 years), peer-reviewed status, and relevance to neurobiological, neurochemical, and behavioral aspects of apathy in AD. The articles were screened through title and abstract reviews, followed by full-text evaluations to ensure they met the inclusion criteria, such as relevance to apathy in Alzheimer's patients, study design rigor, and methodological quality.
RESULTS: Some research on the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of apathy in AD points to the role of the front-striatal circuitry, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, we reviewed the neurochemical, neuropsychological, and neuropathological characteristics believed to be associated with apathy symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that understanding the intricate neurobiological underpinnings of apathy in AD is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Our analysis suggests that a multimodal approach, incorporating both pharmacological and personalized non-pharmacological strategies, could enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. This highlights the need for future research to explore these combined treatment modalities and their potential to alleviate apathy in AD patients.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
39762366,Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies display a signature alteration of their cognitive connectome.,"Cognition plays a central role in the diagnosis and characterization of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the complex associations among cognitive deficits in different domains in DLB are largely unknown. To characterize these associations, we investigated and compared the cognitive connectome of DLB patients, healthy controls (HC), and Alzheimer's disease patients (AD). We obtained data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. We built cognitive connectomes for DLB (n = 104), HC (n = 3703), and AD (n = 1985) using correlations among 24 cognitive measures mapping multiple cognitive domains. Connectomes were compared using global and nodal graph measures of centrality, integration, and segregation. For global measures, DLB showed a higher global efficiency (integration) and lower transitivity (segregation) than HC and AD. For nodal measures, DLB showed higher global efficiency in most measures, higher participation (centrality) in free-recall memory, processing speed/attention, and executive measures, and lower local efficiency (segregation) than HC. Compared with AD, DLB showed lower nodal strength and local efficiency, especially in memory consolidation. The cognitive connectome of DLB shows a loss of segregation, leading to a loss of cognitive specialization. This study provides the data to advance the understanding of cognitive impairment and clinical phenotype in DLB, with implications for differential diagnosis.",Sci Rep,2025
39998322,Identification of 16 novel Alzheimer's disease loci using multi-ancestry meta-analyses.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. While many AD-associated genetic determinants have been identified, few studies have analyzed individuals of non-European ancestry.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy using whole genome sequencing data from the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS), National Institute of Mental Health, UK Biobank (UKB), and All of Us (AoU) consisting of 49,149 cases (12,074 clinically diagnosed and 37,075 AD-by-proxy) and 383,225 controls. Nearly half of NIAGADS and AoU participants were of non-European ancestry.
RESULTS: For clinically diagnosed AD, we identified 14 new loci-five common (FBN2/SCL27A6, AC090115.1, DYM, KCNG1/AL121785.1, TIAM1) and nine rare (VWA5B1, RNU6-755P/LMX1A, MOB1A, MORC1-AS1, LINC00989, PDE4D, RNU2-49P/CDO1, NEO1, and SLC35G3/AC022916.1). Meta-analysis of UKB and AoU AD-by-proxy cases yielded two new rare loci (RPL23/LASP1 and CEBPA/AC008738.6), also nominally significant in NIAGADS.
DISCUSSION: In summary, we provide evidence for 16 novel AD loci and advocate for more studies using whole genome sequencing-based GWAS of diverse cohorts.
HIGHLIGHTS: We used whole-genome sequencing data from large and diverse cohorts. We found novel genome-wide association study findings based on whole-genome data. We performed a multiancestry meta-analysis and incorporated results from underrepresented groups.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40095208,Intranasal Delivery of Lithium Salt Suppresses Inflammatory Pyroptosis in the Brain and Ameliorates Memory Loss and Depression-like Behavior in 5XFAD Mice.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease (AD) and has no treatment that can cure or halt the disease progression. This study explored the therapeutic potential of lithium salt dissolved in Ryanodex formulation vehicle (RFV) and delivered to the brain by intranasal application. We first compared lithium concentrations in the brain and blood of wild-type mice following intranasal or oral administration of lithium chloride (LiCl) dissolved in either RFV or water. The beneficial and side effects of intranasal versus oral LiCl in RFV in these mice were assessed and potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of anti-inflammation and anti-pyroptosis in the brains were also investigated in both wild-type and 5XFAD Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mice brains.
METHODS: For the study of brain versus blood lithium concentrations, wild-type (WT) B6SJLF1/J mice at 2 months of age were treated with intranasal or oral LiCl (3 mmol/kg) dissolved in RFV or in water. Brain and blood lithium concentrations were measured at various times after drugs administration. Brain/blood lithium concentration ratios were then determined. For studying therapeutic efficacy versus side effects and their underlying mechanisms, 5XFAD and WT B6SJLF1/J mice were treated with intranasal LiCl (3 mmol/kg) daily, Monday to Friday each week, in RFV beginning at 2 or 9 months of age with a 12-week treatment duration. Animal behaviors were assessed for depression (tail suspension), cognition (fear conditioning and Y maze), olfaction (buried food test), and motor functions (rotarod) at the age of 5 and 12 months. Blood and brain tissue were harvested from these mice at 13 months. Blood biomarkers for the functions of thyroid (thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH) and kidney (creatinine) were measured using ELISA. Changes in protein expression levels of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels type 1 InsP<sub>3</sub> receptors (InsP<sub>3</sub>R-1), malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified proteins and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), pyroptosis regulatory proteins (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal of Gasdermin D (GSDMD)), cytotoxic (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α) and cytoprotective (IL-10) cytokines and synapse proteins (PSD-95, synapsin-1) were determined using immunoblotting. Mouse body weights were monitored regularly.
RESULTS: Compared to oral LiCl in RFV nanoparticles, intranasal treatment of WT mice with LiCl in RFV markedly decreased blood concentrations at the time range of 30-120 min. The ratio of brain/blood lithium concentration after intranasal lithium chloride in RFV significantly increased, in comparison to those after oral administration lithium chloride in RFV or intranasal administration of lithium chloride in water. Intranasal lithium chloride in RFV inhibited both memory loss and depressive behavior in adult and aged 5XFAD mice. Additionally intranasal treatment of aged 5XFAD mice with LiCl in RFV effectively suppressed the increases in InsP<sub>3</sub>R-1, intracellular oxidative stress markers (4-HNE-bound and MDA-modified proteins), pyroptosis activation proteins (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal GSDMD) and cytotoxic cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), but reversed the down-regulation of cytoprotective cytokine IL-10. Intranasal LiCl in RFV also alleviated the loss of the postsynaptic synapse proteins PSD-95, but not synapsin-1, in aged 5XFAD mice. Blood level of the kidney function marker creatinine was significantly increased in 5XFAD than in WT mice in an age-dependent manner and this elevation was abolished by intranasal delivery of LiCl in RFV. Intranasal LiCl in RFV for 12 weeks in both WT or 5XFAD mice did not affect blood biomarkers for thyroid function, nor did it affect smell or muscle function or body weight.
CONCLUSION: Intranasal administration of LiCl in RFV significantly decreased lithium blood concentrations and increased brain/blood lithium concentration ratio, in comparison to its oral administration. Intranasal administration of LiCl in RFV robustly protected against both memory loss and depressive-like behavior, while had no side effects concerning thyroid and kidney toxicity in 5XFAD mice. These lithium-induced beneficial effects were strongly associated with lithium's suppression of InsP<sub>3</sub>R-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel receptor increase, pathological neuroinflammation and activation of the pyroptosis pathway, as well as the loss of the synaptic protein PSD-95. Intranasal delivery of lithium salt in RFV could become an effective and potent inhibitor of pathological inflammation/pyroptosis in the CNS and serve as a new treatment for both AD-associated dementia and depression with minimal unwanted side effects including peripheral organ toxicity.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2025
40111925,"Predictors of transitions between normal cognition, cognitive impairment, and dementia in a longitudinal cohort.","BackgroundUnderstanding how sociodemographic characteristics and medical history are associated with progression (or regression) of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias could inform intervention strategies, personalized prognoses, and projections of population-level burden.ObjectiveWe estimated transition rates for progression and reversion between normal cognition, cognitive impairment, dementia, and death in a longitudinal cohort, as well as associations with sociodemographic characteristics and medical history.MethodsWe applied a multistate transition model to a cohort of 960 participants (with 2-16 (median 3) annual visits; 2006-24). Covariate hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated in models adjusted for age group.ResultsSeveral covariates were associated with faster progression from normal cognition to cognitive impairment but slower progression from cognitive impairment to dementia. For example, non-Hispanic Black participants transitioned from normal to cognitive impairment at higher rates (HR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.63, 3.21) and to dementia at lower rates (HR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.23) than non-Hispanic White participants. Additionally, amnestic versus non-amnestic impairment emerged as a strong predictor of transitions from cognitive impairment by reducing reversion to normal cognition (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74) and accelerating progression to dementia (HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.49, 4.22). History of traumatic brain injury was associated with reversion from cognitive impairment to normal cognition (HR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.13, 5.23).ConclusionsA better understanding and measurement of cognitive impairment is needed to explain and predict both reversion to normal cognition and why factors associated with faster onset of impairment may be associated with delayed onset of dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40037468,"2024 VCP International Conference: Exploring multi-disciplinary approaches from basic science of valosin containing protein, an AAA+ ATPase protein, to the therapeutic advancement for VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathy.","Valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) is a ubiquitously expressed AAA+ ATPase associated with numerous protein-protein interactions and critical cellular functions including protein degradation and clearance, mitochondrial homeostasis, DNA repair and replication, cell cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, and lysosomal functions including autophagy and apoptosis. Autosomal-dominant missense mutations in the VCP gene may result in VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathy (VCP-MSP), a rare degenerative disorder linked to heterogeneous phenotypes including inclusion body myopathy (IBM) with Paget's disease of bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or IBMPFD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), parkinsonism, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT), and spastic paraplegia.

39839371,Long-Term Multimodal Exercise Intervention for Patients with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration: Feasibility and Preliminary Outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: After Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common form of early-onset dementia. Despite the heavy burden of care for FTLD, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments with sufficient efficacy remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a multimodal exercise program for FTLD and to examine preliminary changes in the clinical outcomes of the program in FTLD.
METHODS: This single-arm preliminary study was conducted from July 2017 to July 2018 and recruited 4 male patients with FTLD aged 60-78 years. Patients exercised under the supervision of an exercise instructor once every 2 weeks for 48 weeks. The multimodal exercise program comprised cognitive training, moderate-intensity continuous training, strength training, balance training, and flexibility and relaxation training. Feasibility was measured using dropout and attendance rates. Cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral function tests were conducted before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: All patients completed the intervention (100%) and attended well (93.6%). Positive changes in scores in the Stroop Color-Word Test (cognitive; 5 out of 6 items), Mood Check List-short form 2 (psychological), movement subscales of the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (behavioral), and Timed Up and Go (TUG, physical) assessments demonstrated a medium-to-high effect size (open effect size: 0.52-0.97). While there were improvements in some domains, such as recovery self-efficacy and exercise efficacy, the MMSE-J scores showed an overall slight decline, especially in the semantic dementia case where a marked decrease was observed. Additionally, three physical function items showed no effect, except for a positive outcome in the TUG test. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy revealed increased activation in the frontal lobe, indicated by elevated oxygenated hemoglobin levels before and after the exercise intervention. This pattern of activation suggests that the intervention may have stimulated neural activity in the frontal lobe, potentially enhancing cognitive and behavioral functions, including executive function and attention.
CONCLUSION: The long-term multimodal exercise intervention may be feasible and positively change the cognitive, psychological, physical, and behavioral functions in older adults with FTLD. Although the intervention led to improvements in certain areas, there were also declines observed in various functions, which may not necessarily be due to the intervention itself but rather reflect the natural progression of the disease.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra,2025
39702989,Multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers and subtle cognitive decline in a population-based cohort without dementia.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between subtle cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as measured by biomarkers in settings outside of specialty memory clinics is not well characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate how subtle longitudinal cognitive decline relates to neuroimaging biomarkers in individuals drawn from a population-based study in an economically depressed, small-town area in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA.
METHODS: A subset of participants without dementia (N = 115, age 76.53 years ± 6.25) from the Monongahela Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) study completed neuroimaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-signature region cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451-PET for tau deposition. Neuropsychological evaluations were completed at multiple timepoints up to 11 years prior to neuroimaging. Aβ positivity was determined using a regional approach. We used linear mixed models to examine neuroimaging biomarker associations with retrospective cognitive slopes in five domains and a global cognitive composite.
RESULTS: Among Aβ(+) participants (38%), there were associations between (i) tau Braak III/IV and language decline (p < 0.05), (ii) cortical thickness and both memory decline (p < 0.001) and global cognitive decline (p < 0.01), and (iii) WMH and decline in executive function (p < 0.05) and global cognition (p < 0.05). Among Aβ(-) participants, there was an association between tau Braak III/IV and decline on tests of attention/psychomotor speed (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm an Aβ-dependent early AD biomarker pathway, and suggest a possible Aβ-independent, non-AD process underlying subtle cognitive decline in a population-based sample of older adults without dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

39840019,Olfactory dysfunction as potential biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases represent a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system, leading to a range of cognitive, motor, and sensory impairments. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the association between neurodegenerative diseases and olfactory dysfunction (OD). Characterized by a decline in the ability to detect or identify odors, OD has been observed in various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This phenomenon often precedes the onset of other clinical symptoms, suggesting its potential utility as an early marker or prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a vast literature overview on the current knowledge of OD in PD, AD, ALS, and HD in order to evaluate its potential as a biomarker, particularly in the early and prodromal stages of these diseases. We summarize the most common methods used to measure olfactory function and delve into neuropathological correlations and the alterations in neurotransmitter systems associated with OD in those neurodegenerative diseases, including differences in genetic variants if applicable, and cater to current pitfalls and shortcomings in the research.",Front Neurosci,2024
39953559,Pathway-based network medicine identifies novel natural products for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by a complex pathogenesis that complicates the development of effective treatments. Natural products are promising multitarget agents because of their ability to interact with multiple molecular targets. Network-based medicine presents a robust strategy for discovering such agents, which can address the intricate mechanisms underlying AD.
METHODS: In this study, we constructed an AD-related pathway-gene network via text mining and pathway database construction. This network facilitated the identification of natural products that target multiple pathways and genes associated with AD. We evaluated the safety profiles of two selected natural products in C57BL/6J mice through assessments of general behavior, body weight changes, vital organ weight and morphology, and hematological and biochemical parameters. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were subsequently treated with these natural products-either individually or in combination-to assess their therapeutic effects. Cognitive function was evaluated via behavioral tests, such as novel object recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to examine Aβ-associated pathological changes. Transcriptomic analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of the natural products.
RESULTS: The constructed AD-related pathway-gene network encompassed three perspectives: (i) Most Studied Pathways (21 pathways with 5325 genes), (ii) Gene-Associated Pathways (26 pathways with 2557 genes), and (iii) Popular Pathways (24 pathways with 3435 genes). Two natural products, (-)-Vestitol and Salviolone, were selected for further validation. Their safety was confirmed in C57BL/6J mice. Notably, the combination of (-)-Vestitol and Salviolone synergistically affected cognitive function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by reducing Aβ deposition and lowering toxic soluble Aβ levels in the brain. Transcriptomic analysis and qRT-PCR experiments revealed that their combination regulated AD-related pathways and genes more comprehensively, particularly affecting the Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and Calcium signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that screening potential natural products through an AD-related pathway-gene network is a promising strategy for discovering novel therapeutics for AD. The therapeutic potential of (-)-Vestitol and Salviolone as novel candidates for AD treatment is underscored by their synergistic effects, attributed to their comprehensive regulation of AD-associated pathways and genes.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39719197,Globular-shaped Aβ oligomers have diverse mechanisms for promoting Aβ aggregations with the facilitation of fibril elongation.,"The accumulation of amyloid β-proteins (Aβ) in the extracellular space, forming insoluble plaques, is a primary pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the various Aβ species that appear during Aβ aggregation, Aβ oligomers are considered the most neurotoxic form. However, the precise mechanisms of their molecular functions within the Aβ aggregation cascade have not been clarified so far. This research aimed to uncover the structural and functional characteristics of globular-shaped Aβ oligomers (gAβO) under in vitro conditions. We performed thioflavin T (ThT) assays on low-molecular-weight (LMW) Aβ42, testing different concentrations of Aβ42 mature fibril (MF) seeds and gAβO. Fibril formation was continuously observed using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) in LMW Aβ42 with different sample conditions. Conformational changes of Aβ42 aggregates in the presence of gAβO was also evaluated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results of the ThT analysis and HS-AFM observation indicated that gAβO promoted fibril formation of LMW Aβ42 while gAβO itself did not form fibrous aggregates, indicating that gAβO would have a catalytic effects on LMW Aβ42 aggregation. We also showed that the molecular interaction of gAβO was altered by the presence and amount of MF seeds in the reaction buffers, indicating that complex interactions would exist among different Aβ species. The results of our present research demonstrated that gAβO would have significant roles to accelerate Aβ aggregation in AD pathogenesis. 225 < 250 words.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39975923,Lower Network Functional Connectivity Is Associated With Higher Regional Tau Burden Among Those At-Risk of Alzheimer's Disease But Cognitively Unimpaired: Specific Patterns Based on Amyloid Status.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional connectivity within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and default mode network (DMN) changes across Alzheimer's disease stages, influenced by and influencing cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) and regional tau burden. Previous research highlights functional connectivity's role in Alzheimer's disease progression and the interactions of cortical Aβ and functional connectivity within and between the MTL and DMN, but their impact on regional tau deposition remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from OASIS-3 (AV1451 cohort, n=287) were classified into Aβ- (n=193) and Aβ+ (n=94) groups via amyloid-PET for cross-sectional analyses. Principal components analysis of functional connectivity identified two MTL-functional connectivity and DMN-functional connectivity principal components (PCs), which were correlated with regional tau per Braak stages 1-6 brain regions. Aβ status-specific robust regressions evaluated whether functional connectivity was associated with tau.
RESULTS: In Aβ- participants, lower ""MTL Integration Axis"" functional connectivity (PC1) was associated with higher tau levels in the left entorhinal cortex. In Aβ+ participants, lower ""MTL Integration Axis"" functional connectivity correlated with elevated tau levels in the DMN's left lateral parietal cortex, MTL's right parahippocampal cortex, and Braak stages 3-6 brain regions.
DISCUSSION: Decreased functional connectivity was associated with increased regional tau burden, showing Aβ status-specific effects. Enhancing MTL functional connectivity could be a therapeutic strategy and a promising direction for future clinical interventions.",Res Sq,2025
39718338,Precision diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease for therapeutic interventions.,"With the advent of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) therapy, precision diagnosis is necessary for identifying appropriate patients with cognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease. Therapy with AAMAs requires that candidates be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β, have good physical, psychiatric, and medical health, and lack clinical or biomarker evidence of potentially impactful non-Alzheimer brain disorders. The first three diagnostic activities are the core of the Clinical Practice Guidelines, but the last element of the precision diagnosis requires new decision-making tools for recognizing multi-etiology cognitive impairment. Within the context of shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and family, proper diagnosis is essential. In addition to discussing the benefits and risks of AAMA therapy, the experienced clinician must empathetically assist in bridging the gap between expectations of benefit and the patient's overall diagnostic suitability for AAMA therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: In order to prescribe an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) to the right patients, those selected for treatment should be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β (Aβ), and have good physical, psychiatric, or medical health. Persons with Alzheimer's biology as the primary etiology are the ideal AAMA treatment recipients. A novel activity necessary to optimize therapeutic response is to exclude persons with clinical or biomarker evidence of alternative contributory brain disorders. While mild clinical severity and elevated brain amyloid-β are essential elements for selecting patients for AAMA treatment, clinical judgment is required to weigh the implications of more advanced disease severity, other medical co-morbidities, and the presence of other contributory neuropathologies.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

In this study we evaluate the association of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers with amyloid PET progression among initially amyloid PET negative (A-) individuals.
METHODS: We included 290 A-, cognitively unimpaired Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants. We estimated the association of each baseline plasma biomarker with progression from A- to A+ and with rate of amyloid PET change.
RESULTS: Interquartile range differences in amyloid beta 42/40, percent phosphorylated tau 217 (%p-tau217), and Amyloid Probability Score 2 were associated with 1.29 (P = 0.09), 1.38 (P < 0.001), and 1.20 (P = 0.05) increases, respectively, in the hazard of progression from A- to A+ and 0.27 (P = 0.16), 0.50 (P = 0.007), and 0.28 (P = 0.15) Centiloid/year increases, respectively, in annual rate of amyloid PET change.
DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 may be a useful screening tool to enrich for participants with increased likelihood of progressing from normal to abnormal amyloid PET in a primary prevention trial.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 was associated with amyloid positron emission tomography progression, negative to positive. The associations were weaker for amyloid beta 42/40 and Amyloid Probability Score 2. Age and apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership were also important predictors.

40145384,Amyloid PET predicts longitudinal functional and cognitive trajectories in a heterogeneous cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly available for diagnosis of Alzheimer`s disease (AD); however, its practical implications in heterogenous cohorts are debated.
METHODS: Amyloid PET from 890 National Alzheimer`s Coordinating Center participants with up to 10 years post-PET follow up was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed models were used to investigate amyloid burden prediction of etiology and prospective functional status and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Amyloid positivity was associated with progression from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Amyloid burden in the unimpaired group was associated with lower initial memory levels and faster decline in memory, language, and global cognition. In the Impaired group, amyloid was associated with lower initial levels and faster decline for memory, language, executive function, and global cognition.
DISCUSSION: Amyloid burden is an important prognostic marker in a clinically heterogeneous cohort. Future work is needed to establish the proportion of decline driven by AD versus non-AD processes in the context of mixed pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our findings highlight the importance of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in heterogenous cohorts, including diverse demographics, clinical syndromes, and underlying etiologies. The results also provide evidence that higher amyloid levels were linked to functional progression from unimpaired cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, higher amyloid burden was associated with poorer memory at baseline and subsequent declines in memory, language, and global cognition. Among individuals with cognitive impairment, amyloid burden was associated with worse initial memory, language, executive function, and global cognition, and faster declines over time.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40151915,APOE ε4 influences the dynamic functional connectivity variability and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundApolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is the most significant genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its impact on the dynamic changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC), particularly concerning network formation, interaction, and dissolution over time, remains largely unexplored in AD.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the effect of APOE ε4 on dynamic FC (dFC) variability and cognitive performance in AD.MethodsWe analyzed the dFC of AD patients, comparing APOE ε4 carriers (n = 33) with non-carriers (n = 41). The whole-brain dFC was assessed by calculating dynamic fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dfALFF) and dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo). To further explore the relationship between cognitive function and dFC in AD patients, we conducted a correlation analysis. Mediation analysis was also performed to determine whether dFC mediates the link between the APOE ε4 and cognitive decline in AD patients.ResultsAD patients carrying the APOE ε4 exhibited more severe cognitive impairment, along with reduced dReHo and dfALFF in both the left and right posterior cerebellar lobes. In these carriers, the dFC analysis showed lower dFC between the left posterior cerebellar lobe and the left middle temporal gyrus, which was positively correlated with executive function and information processing speed. Additionally, mediation analysis indicated that APOE ε4 influences dFC in this brain region, contributing to executive dysfunction in AD.ConclusionsThese findings offer preliminary evidence that APOE ε4 modulates fluctuating communication within the cerebellar lobe and the dFC between the cerebellar lobe and the temporal gyrus in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39797928,Ghrelin Induces Ferroptosis Resistance and M2 Polarization of Microglia to Alleviate Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Microglial polarization and ferroptosis are important pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ghrelin, a brain-gut hormone, has potential neuroprotective effects in AD. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms by which ghrelin regulates the progression of AD, as well as the crosstalk between microglial polarization and ferroptosis. Mouse BV2 microglial cells and male mice were treated with beta-amyloid (Aβ) (1-42) to simulate the AD environment. Microglia ferroptosis was measured by detecting levels of ferroptosis-related proteins (SLC7A11, GPX4, FTL1, and FTH1), metabolic markers (ROS, MDA, GSH, SOD), and observing mitochondrial morphological changes. Microglial polarization was evaluated by measuring levels of inflammatory markers and surface markers. The impact of ghrelin on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-exposed microglia was assessed by coupling with the ferroptosis activator Erastin. Cognitive impairment in AD mice was evaluated through behavioral tests. Tissue staining was applied to determine neuronal damage. In Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-exposed microglia, ghrelin upregulated the protein expression of SLC7A11, GPX4, FTL1 and FTH1, reduced ROS and MDA levels, and elevated GSH and SOD levels through the BMP6/SMAD1 pathway. Ghrelin alleviated mitochondrial structural damage. Additionally, ghrelin reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors and CD86, while increasing levels of anti-inflammatory factors and CD206. Erastin reversed the effects of ghrelin on ferroptosis and phenotypic polarization in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-exposed microglia. In AD mice, ghrelin ameliorated abnormal behavior, neuroinflammation, and plaque deposition. Ghrelin attenuated iNOS/IBA1-positive expression and enhanced Arg-1/IBA1-positive expression in the hippocampus. Ghrelin induces microglial M2 polarization by inhibiting microglia ferroptosis, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation. Our results indicate that ghrelin may serve as a promising potential agent for treating cognitive impairment in AD.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2025
39822591,Comparison of sample characteristics of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants with the Wisconsin state population-An evaluation of the recruitment effort.,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding how a research sample compares to the population from which it is drawn can help inform future recruitment planning. We compared the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WADRC) participant sample to the Wisconsin state population (WI-pop) on key demographic, social exposome, and vascular risk measures.
METHODS: The WADRC sample included 930 participants. Population statistics were estimated using several national and state data sources. We compared WADRC to WI-pop for two age groups, 45-64 years and ≥65 years, separately.
RESULTS: Compared to WI-pop, WADRC participants were older and included more women, more Black and American Indian individuals, and fewer Hispanic and Asian individuals. WADRC participants had higher levels of educational attainment, consisted of smaller proportions living in rural areas and disadvantaged neighborhoods, and showed lower vascular risks. Greater differences between WADRC and WI-pop were found for most metrics in the ≥65 group compared to the 45-64 group.
DISCUSSION: The findings revealed opportunities to increase enrollment from the Hispanic/Latino and Asian American populations, to include participants from a broader range of educational backgrounds, and to enroll more residents from rural areas and disadvantaged neighborhoods, which may lead to a broader distribution of cardiovascular risk factors. Expanding sociodemographic and health profiles represented in the participant candidate pool for study selection and including those who are underrepresented in research may potentially reduce selection bias but not eliminate it. Statistical approaches can be applied to address bias and generalize findings from a study sample to its target population by adjusting for their differences in the joint distribution of covariates. Although research centers have different regional populations and specific recruitment focuses for scientific reasons, evaluating their participant characteristics may help plan engagement efforts to improve the inclusion of underrepresented groups and collaboratively support generalizable research nationwide.
HIGHLIGHTS: We compared the characteristics of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WADRC) participants with the Wisconsin population.Metrics of comparison included demographics, social exposomes, and vascular risks.WADRC participants are different from the Wisconsin population.We explored the implications and causes of the differences.We discussed strategies for engaging and recruiting underrepresented groups.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39772836,Integrating network pharmacology and component analysis to investigate the potential mechanisms of Sheng-Hui-Yi-Zhi decoction in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the potential mechanisms of Sheng-Hui-Yi-Zhi (SHYZ) for the treatment of AD and explore the effective substances of SHYZ.
METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the active components of SHYZ. Network pharmacology was employed to predict the potential targets and pathways of SHYZ in the treatment of AD. SAMP8 mice were used as a model for AD and were treated with SHYZ. The Morris water maze was utilized to assess the learning and memory capabilities of mice. Additionally, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the brain hippocampus of mice were quantified using ELISA. The protein expression of PI3 K/p-PI3 K, AKT/p-AKT, MAPK38/p-MAPK38, and NFκB p65/p-NFκB p65 in the hippocampus was analyzed using Western blotting. Additionally, qRT-PCR was employed to assess the gene expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus.
RESULT: The network pharmacological prediction results showed that the treatment of AD with SHYZ was closely related to the inhibition of inflammatory response. Behavioral experiments revealed that SHYZ significantly reduced the time taken to escape, increased the number of times the platform was crossed, and prolonged the residence time in the target quadrant. Meanwhile, SHYZ treatment suppressed the expression of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> protein and inflammatory factors. SHYZ significantly inhibited the expression of proteins of PI3 K, AKT, MAPK p38, and NF-κB p65.
CONCLUSIONS: SHYZ has been shown to effectively ameliorate learning and memory impairment in SAMP8 AD mice by inhibiting the expression of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and reducing the increase of inflammatory factors.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39813358,Transient interactions between the fuzzy coat and the cross-β core of brain-derived Aβ42 filaments.,"Several human disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by the aberrant formation of amyloid fibrils. In many cases, the amyloid core is flanked by disordered regions, known as fuzzy coat. The structural properties of fuzzy coats, and their interactions with their environments, however, have not been fully described to date. Here, we generate conformational ensembles of two brain-derived amyloid filaments of Aβ42, corresponding respectively to the familial and sporadic forms of AD. Our approach, called metadynamic electron microscopy metainference (MEMMI), provides a characterization of the transient interactions between the fuzzy coat and the cross-β core of the filaments. These calculations indicate that the familial AD filaments are less soluble than the sporadic AD filaments, and that the fuzzy coat contributes to solubilizing both types of filament. These results illustrate how the metainference approach can help analyze cryo-EM maps for the characterization of the properties of amyloid fibrils.",Sci Adv,2025
39766459,"Effects of Mental Imagery on Quality of Life, Cognitive, and Emotional Status in Older Adults with Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Dementia is a syndrome which involves cognitive and motor problems such as memory and motor control that impacts the individuals' quality of life. In mental imagery (MI) technique, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MI on the quality of life, cognitive, and emotional status of older adults with an early stage of dementia.
METHODS: The present randomized controlled trial consisted of 160 participants. The sample from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association was randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (intervention group, n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group, n = 52), and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group, n = 53). Participants engaged in a total of 24 physiotherapy sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min, scheduled twice weekly over a 12-week period. They performed three assessments: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) one and a half months, and (c) after the program. The intervention group performed a 30 min MI with exercise program content immediately following every physiotherapy exercise session. Walking While Talking Test (WWITT), the Euro-Qol 5-Dimensions 5-Level of severity scale (Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale), the Short-Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (SF-GDS), and the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) were used to assess cognitive status, emotional status, and quality of life.
RESULTS: A total of 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, with MMSE M = 23.20 SD = 0.15) took part in this study in which most reported holding a university degree (n = 77), were married (n = 101), and had loss of memory as the 1st symptom of dementia (n= 117). The Friedman test revealed statistically significant differences across the three groups on (a) the WWITT<sub>mistakes</sub> (X<sup>2</sup> = 14.95, df = 2, p = 0.001) and WWITT<sub>time</sub> (X<sup>2</sup> = 13.35, df = 2, p = 0.01), (b) the total Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale (X<sup>2</sup> = 11.87.62, df = 2, p = 0.003) and quality of life on the measuring day (X<sup>2</sup> = 25.59, df = 2, p = 0.00), (c) the SF-GDS (X<sup>2</sup> = 6.54, df = 2, p = 0.038), and (d) the SAST (X<sup>2</sup> = 39.907.62, df = 2, p = 0.00). The Friedman test with post hoc Wilcoxon analysis revealed that the mean scores for the intervention group and the 1st control were significantly better than the 2nd control group in many dependent variables.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that incorporating MI can positively influence cognitive status, emotional status, and the quality of life in older adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia.",Brain Sci,2024

All of them developed multiple cerebral hemorrhages, transient focal neurological deficits, and/or cognitive impairment after 3-4 decades. MRI was compatible with CAA, and Aβ deposition was confirmed.

40182143,Differential cognitive functioning in the digital clock drawing test in AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), but there are differences in pathogenesis and cognitive performance between Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI) and Parkinson's disease with Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) populations. Studies have shown that assessments based on the digital clock drawing test (dCDT) can effectively reflect cognitive deficits. Based on this, we proposed the following research hypothesis: there is a difference in cognitive functioning between AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations in the CDT, and the two populations can be effectively distinguished based on this feature.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we designed the dCDT to extract digital biomarkers that can characterize and quantify cognitive function differences between AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations. We enrolled a total of 40 AD-MCI patients, 40 PD-MCI patients, 41 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) patients and 40 normal cognition (NC) controls.
RESULTS: Through a cross-sectional study, we revealed a difference in cognitive function between AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations in the dCDT, which distinguished AD-MCI from PD-MCI patients, the area under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.923, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.866-0.983. The AUC for effective differentiation between AD-MCI and PD-MCI patients with high education (≥12 years of education) was 0.968, CI = 0.927-1.000. By correlation analysis, we found that the overall plotting of task performance score (VFDB <sub>1</sub>) correlated with the [visuospatial/executive] subtest score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [R] = 0.472, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The dCDT is a tool that can rapidly and accurately characterize and quantify differences in cognitive functioning in AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations.",Front Neurosci,2025
39806094,"Common Variants in PLXNA4 and Correlation to Neuroimaging Phenotypes in Healthy, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's Disease Cohorts.","A comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) has validated the identification of the Plexin-A 4 (PLXNA4) gene as a novel susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, the precise role of PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms in the pathophysiology of AD remains to be established. Consequently, this study is aimed at exploring the relationship between PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms and neuroimaging phenotypes intimately linked to AD. This study encompassed 812 subjects with PLXNA4 genotype data, procured from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Employing a tagging strategy, we identified five common variant sites within the PLXNA4 gene and assessed their associations with glucose metabolism, atrophy in AD-related brain regions (including the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus), and intracerebral Aβ deposition. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using a multiple linear regression model, with neuroimaging phenotypes as the dependent variable and PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms as the independent variable while incorporating APOE e4 carrier status, education level, age, and gender as covariates. The subjects were stratified into three groups based on their disease status: the Alzheimer's disease (AD) group, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group, and the cognitively normal healthy control (CN) group. Within each group, we examined the associations between PLXNA4 gene polymorphisms and various neuroimaging phenotypes. Our study identified significant associations between the rs156676-A and rs78036292-G alleles and the baseline volumes of the anterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus, respectively, across the entire population. After 1 year of follow-up, a significant correlation was observed between the rs6467431-G allele and accelerated volumetric atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus in the overall population. Additionally, at the 2-year follow-up, significant correlations were observed between three PLXNA4 loci (rs1863015, rs6467431, rs67468325) and volumetric atrophy in the anterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and hippocampus across the entire population. Specifically, the rs1863015-G allele notably accelerated atrophy of the left middle temporal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus, whereas the A alleles of rs6467431 and rs67468325 markedly accelerated atrophy specifically in the bilateral hippocampus. Subgroup analysis further validated these findings. Additionally, in the baseline CN group, the rs78036292 allele showed a significant correlation with intracerebral Aβ deposition, while in the 2-year follow-up CN group, rs67468325 was significantly associated with alterations in glucose metabolism rates in the right cingulate gyrus. Our findings indicate that PLXNA4 genotypes may modulate the development of AD through their regulation of intracerebral Aβ deposition. Additionally, PLXNA4 genotypes are strongly associated with AD-related brain atrophy and glucose metabolism, suggesting that they may alter susceptibility to AD by modulating neurodegenerative biomarkers.",Mol Neurobiol,2025

39761671,Lecanemab-Associated Amyloid-β Protofibril in Cerebrospinal Fluid Correlates with Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The Clarity AD phase III trial showed that lecanemab reduced amyloid markers in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and resulted in less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo. Herein, we aimed to characterize amyloid-β (Aβ) protofibril (PF) captured by lecanemab in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living participants with different stages in AD, which enable an enhanced understanding of the dynamic changes of lecanemab-associated Aβ-PF (Lec-PF) in vivo.
METHODS: We newly developed a unique and highly sensitive immunoassay method using lecanemab that selectively captures Lec-PF. The CSF level of Lec-PF, Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau 217, total tau, and neurogranin were measured in Japanese participants (n = 163). The participants in this study consisted of 48 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-negative (CU-), 8 cognitively impaired diagnosed as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, 9 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-positive (CU+), 34 Aβ-positive with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 64 Aβ-positive with AD dementia (AD+).
RESULTS: The CSF Lec-PF levels significantly increased in the groups of MCI+ and AD+ compared with CU- group. Notably, CSF Lec-PF showed modest correlation with plaque-associated biomarkers in Aβ-positive participants and stronger correlation with neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as CSF total tau and neurogranin, suggesting that CSF Lec-PF levels proximally reflect neurodegeneration as well as the amount of senile amyloid plaques.
INTERPRETATION: This is the first report describing Aβ-PF species captured by lecanemab in human CSF and supporting that Lec-PF is correlated with neurodegeneration in AD and may explain the mechanism of the clinical effect of lecanemab. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol,2025
39924909,Cognitive function instrument-based anosognosia to predict amyloid status.,"Anosognosia, a lack of self-awareness regarding cognitive dysfunction, often accompanies the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study explored the relationship between AD pathology and anosognosia measured by discrepancies in Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) scores, as rated by participants and their study partners (SP). Using mixed-effects models on non-demented participant data, the results revealed that lower self-reported CFI score compared to SP ratings was significantly associated with positive amyloid PET results (odds ratio 1.081 per-1 decrease in ΔCFI). Our findings suggest that CFI-based anosognosia could serve as a potential predictor of positive amyloid PET status.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39968005,Effect of Steroids on the Progression of Alzheimer's Dementia: A Retrospective Chart Review.,"OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of individuals in the United States. Neuroinflammation is a driver of the neurodegenerative changes that characterize AD, prompting interest in how inflammation can be modulated for treatment and prevention.
METHODS: ICD-10 codes were quarried from electronic medical records to identify patients diagnosed with AD from 2012 to 2020. The patients were then divided into those who used systemic steroids and those who did not before the progression of their disease. Data on medication prescribed was used to measure the disease's progression. Clinical findings and laboratory results were collected to build a propensity score. Patients were followed until disease progression, death, or the last available visit. Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios adjusted for the propensity score were used to compare the two groups.
RESULTS: Of the 459 patients identified, 77 were included in the study, and 13 used steroids. Of the 77 patients included in the study, 59 had progression of their disease, and of those, five used steroids. The median time to progression was 408.00 (191.00, 979.00) days for the overall sample. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing the group using steroids to those not using steroids was 0.26 with a 95% CI of (0.1013, 0.673) and a p value of 0.00064.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, steroid use delayed the progression of dementia. Further study is needed to outline how steroids and anti-inflammatory medications can be used in the treatment and prevention of AD.",Aging Med (Milton),2025
39778036,Identification of risk factors and development of a predictive nomogram for sarcopenia in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia, with its complex diagnostic process, is a likely independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, research on the clinical characteristics and biomarkers of AD patients with sarcopenia (ADSA) is limited.
METHODS: This study included 180 ADSA and 188 AD patients without sarcopenia (ADNSA), and evaluated demographics, cognitive function, motor capacity, emotional state, and daily living abilities.
RESULTS: ADSA patients were older, with worse motor and cognitive functions, more severe depression, poorer social functioning, and lower daily living abilities compared to ADNSA patients. Multivariate regression identified age, low Frailty Rating Scale (FRS) scores, low serum albumin level, and low creatinine/cystatin C ratio (CCR) as risk factors for sarcopenia. A nomogram model based on these indicators demonstrated high discriminative power and clinical utility.
DISCUSSION: Sarcopenia significantly affects AD patients' various functions. The nomogram model aids in the early detection of and personalized interventions for sarcopenia in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Sarcopenia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the coexistence of sarcopenia affects various functions and quality of life in patients with AD. Serum albumin and Frailty Rating Scale (FRS) scores are significantly associated with both sarcopenia and cognitive assessment indicators in AD patients with sarcopenia (ADSA). The combined sarcopenia nomogram model with indexes of age at diagnosis, creatinine/cystatin C ratio (CCR), FRS score, and albumin levels can aid in effectively identifying and personalizing interventions for sarcopenia in the AD population.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39994969,A higher vertebrobasilar pulsatility index is associated with lower parietal perfusion in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundWhile cerebrovascular hemodynamics exhibits critical interplay with the pathogenesis of dementia, limited articles have examined the impact of vertebrobasilar (VB) hemodynamics on cerebral blood flow (CBF), and to what extent it varies by dementia subtypes.ObjectiveTo explore the associations between VB hemodynamics and CBF by dementia subtypes.MethodsThis research recruited a total of 120 dementia patients [43 subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD); 59 Alzheimer's disease (AD); 18 mixed dementia] and 40 older adults with normal cognition and compared their transcranial doppler (TCD) flow parameters and arterial spin labeling-measured CBF. Using the partial correlation analysis, the associations between TCD parameters and CBF values were explored among the defined subgroups.ResultsA higher VB pulsatility index (PI) was related to lower parietal CBF and lower VB end-diastolic velocity (EDV). Moreover, the significance of flow parameters in the basilar artery (BA) to parietal CBF was identified: peak-systolic velocity (PSV) unanimously showed positive correlations among all subgroups except SIVD, and both PSV and EDV showed positive correlations in AD. Of note, there were more noticeable ""BA flow-frontoparietal CBF"" associations among the high than low VB PI group, and AD than SIVD group.ConclusionsThe findings indicate that VB-resistance-related parietal vulnerability and topological CBF associations vary by dementia subtypes.

39874376,Pre-treatment subjective sleep quality as a predictive biomarker of tDCS effects in preclinical Alzheimer's disease patients: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Despite transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated encouraging potential for modulating the circadian rhythm, little is known about how well and sustainably tDCS might improve the subjective sleep quality in older adults. This study sought to determine how tDCS affected sleep quality and cognition, as well as how well pre-treatment sleep quality predicted tDCS effects on domain-specific cognitive functions in patients with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (NCD-AD).
METHODS: This clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of tDCS and cognitive training in mild NCD-AD patients (n =  201). Over the course of four weeks, patients were randomized to receive either tDCS plus working memory training, or sham tDCS plus working memory training, or tDCS plus controlled cognitive training. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measured subjective sleep quality. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) was used to evaluate domain-specific cognitive functions.
RESULTS: Recurrent tDCS treatments enhanced subjective sleep quality and cognition considerably. The poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI >  5) who received tDCS treatment had more cognitive benefits (p =  0.031, Cohen's d =  0.605) and sleep improvements (p <  0.001, Cohen's d =  1.209) in comparison to cognitive training. Pre-treatment subjective sleep quality was linked to tDCS-induced improvement in memory function.
CONCLUSION: During the course of two months, repeated tDCS could considerably enhance subjective sleep quality. For the cognitive benefits of the treatments, the status of pre-treatment subjective sleep quality is crucial. More thorough research is necessary to explore an efficient approach to managing comorbidities for preclinical AD patients.",PLoS One,2025

METHODS: We investigated BBB permeability to water and contrast agent simultaneously using a novel tracer kinetic model for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in 42 AD patients, 22 DLB patients, and 22 healthy controls. All participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and MRI assessments.
RESULTS: AD patients exhibited a significant reduction in the water exchange rates across the BBB, whereas DLB patients showed a significant increase in BBB permeability to contrast agent. Moreover, BBB permeability to both water and contrast agent in multiple brain regions demonstrated correlations with clinical severity.
DISCUSSION: The simultaneous evaluation of BBB permeability to water and contrast agent based on the proposed model highlights the heterogeneous patterns of BBB breakdown in AD and DLB.
HIGHLIGHTS: We measured blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability to water and contrast agent based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by lower water exchange rates across the BBB. Dementia with Lewy bodies exhibits higher BBB permeability to contrast agent. BBB permeability is related to cognitive impairment and disease burden. BBB permeability to water was negatively associated with that to contrast agent.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40016187,Neurofind: using deep learning to make individualised inferences in brain-based disorders.,"Within precision psychiatry, there is a growing interest in normative models given their ability to parse heterogeneity. While they are intuitive and informative, the technical expertise and resources required to develop normative models may not be accessible to most researchers. Here we present Neurofind, a new freely available tool that bridges this gap by wrapping sound and previously tested methods on data harmonisation and advanced normative models into a web-based platform that requires minimal input from the user. We explain how Neurofind was developed, how to use the Neurofind website in four simple steps ( www.neurofind.ai ), and provide exemplar applications. Neurofind takes as input structural MRI images and outputs two main metrics derived from independent normative models: (1) Outlier Index Score, a deviation score from the normative brain morphology, and (2) Brain Age, the predicted age based on an individual's brain morphometry. The tool was trained on 3362 images of healthy controls aged 20-80 from publicly available datasets. The volume of 101 cortical and subcortical regions was extracted and modelled with an adversarial autoencoder for the Outlier index model and a support vector regression for the Brain age model. To illustrate potential applications, we applied Neurofind to 364 images from three independent datasets of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. In Alzheimer's disease, 55.2% of patients had very extreme Outlier Index Scores, mostly driven by larger deviations in temporal-limbic structures and ventricles. Patients were also homogeneous in how they deviated from the norm. Conversely, only 30.1% of schizophrenia patients were extreme outliers, due to deviations in the hippocampus and pallidum, and patients tended to be more heterogeneous than controls. Both groups showed signs of accelerated brain ageing.",Transl Psychiatry,2025

Typically, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was widely applied to construct brain connectivity network from BOLD signals of regions of interest. However, it often results in significant intra-group variability and complicates the identification of disease-specific functional connectivity patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel brain network construction strategy, called SNBG, which uses aggregated information from the control group to derive a single-sample network. We compare SNBG and the PCC based method on a dataset from an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. SNBG method captures more stable connections between regions of interest (ROIs) and increases classification accuracy from 89.24% of PCC based method to 97.13%. In addition, in AD-related local networks, such as default mode network (DMN), medial frontal network (MFN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), SNBG demonstrates lower intra-group heterogeneity than the PCC based method.",Sci Rep,2025
40151921,The prevalence of mild behavioral impairment in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundMild behavioral impairment is a neurobehavioral symptom characterized by the onset of a new and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome. Patients with co-occurring mild behavioral impairment and mild cognitive impairment have the relatively highest probability of developing dementia than sick mild behavioral impairment or mild cognitive impairment alone.ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the currently available best estimate of mild behavioral impairment prevalence and clarify the reasons for the difference in estimates.MethodsData were retrieved and collected from five electronic databases. Two reviewers independently appraised the methodological quality of included studies. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the I² statistic and random effects models were employed. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. All statistical analyses were conducted by Stata.ResultsA total of 23 reports involving 5397 participants were included in this systematic review. The pooled effect size for the overall mild behavioral impairment was 52% (95%CI 42-62%). In the subgroup analysis and regression analysis, we found that study type, study area, assessment tools, and study subject gender could explain part of the source of heterogeneity.ConclusionsThe results of this review suggest that 52% with mild cognitive impairment combined with mild behavioral impairment; there is a close relationship between the two. Future studies should pay more attention to the underlying mechanism between the two and provide a more scientific basis for early discrimination of clinical dementia and Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39984555,Nebulized seabuckthorn seed oil inhalation attenuates Alzheimer's disease progression in APP/PS1 mice.,"Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is known for its medicinal properties in treating various diseases, including neurological conditions. However, the therapeutic effect of inhaled seabuckthorn seed oil (SSO) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains not fully understood. This study explores the effects of nebulized inhalation of SSO in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice over 21 days. The results showed that nebulized SSO improved memory and cognition. Using 7.0T MRI to monitor blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals revealed that SSO altered the Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) signaling such as in the amygdala and substantia innominate, and hippocampus. Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and pathological analyses indicated reduced neuroinflammation in plasma and brain, decreased neuronal necrosis, lower β-amyloid (Aβ) protein levels, reduced amyloid deposition, and increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Additionally, SSO promoted gut microbiota remodeling by increasing alpha diversity and boosting levels of probiotics such as Verrucomicrobia, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Akkermansia, without adverse effects on lung tissue. Nebulized inhalation of SSO may slow AD progression by modulating inflammation and amyloid deposition. Nebulized inhalation offered a potential method for enhancing drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier with reduced systemic side effects.",Sci Rep,2025
40071147,IQGAP2 regulates blood-brain barrier immune dynamics.,"Brain endothelial cells (BECs) play an important role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis through blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions. BECs express low baseline levels of adhesion receptors, which limits entry of leukocytes. However, the molecular mediators governing this phenotype remain mostly unclear. Here, we explored how infiltration of immune cells across the BBB is influenced by the scaffold protein IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 2 (IQGAP2). In mice and zebrafish, we demonstrate that loss of Iqgap2 increases infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the CNS under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistology, we further show that BECs from mice lacking Iqgap2 exhibit a profound inflammatory signature, including extensive upregulation of adhesion receptors and antigen-processing machinery. Human tissue analyses also reveal that Alzheimer's disease is associated with reduced hippocampal IQGAP2. Overall, our results implicate IQGAP2 as an essential regulator of BBB immune privilege and immune cell entry into the CNS.",iScience,2025
40194087,Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoid-space Hydrocephalus and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (P1-5.023).,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) in parkinsonian disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and evaluate associations with clinical features and imaging biomarkers.
BACKGROUND: Gait disturbance is the leading symptom of the Hakim's triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and is also a cardinal feature of PSP. DESH is a distinct imaging pattern of NPH with undetermined frequency, clinical significance, and underlying mechanisms in parkinsonian disorders.
DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 290 patients, including 181 PSP (62%), 36 corticobasal syndrome, 21 Parkinson's disease, and 52 controls. An automated machine-based method for DESH (D) detection was applied to volumetric head MRI scans and DESH was determined as present (D+) or absent (D-). Using DESH classification plus a manual measurement for Evans' index (E); cutoff > 0.3 = E+, patients were classified into four groups: Imaging-suggestive of hydrocephalus (D+E+), DESH positive only (D+E-), Evans' index positive only (D-E+), and no imaging evidence of hydrocephalus (D-E-). Demographic, clinical and imaging metrics were ascertained and compared across groups.
RESULTS: Of the 290 patients, 214 were classified as: D+E+ (n=20); D+E- (n=8); D-E+ (n=71) and D-E- (n=115). 18/20 (90%) D+E+ cases were PSP. The D+E+ patients were older, had greater midbrain and cortical atrophy, more periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities and larger cistern areas on MRI, lower striatal metabolism on [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and greater degeneration of long-range white matter tracts on diffusion tensor imaging, compared to the D-E- patients. D+E+ patients had a tendency to have hypermetabolism in the paracentral lobule on [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET.
CONCLUSIONS: DESH can be present in parkinsonian disorders, especially PSP, where it is associated with worse clinical and imaging outcomes. Its presence may be a mechanistic byproduct of degeneration that develop during the process of CSF flow re-distribution. Disclosure: Dr. Fu has nothing to disclose.

39987285,Glucose Metabolic Reprogramming in Microglia: Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Targeted Therapy.,"As intrinsic immune cells in the central nervous system, microglia play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Microglia can transition from homeostasis to various responsive states in reaction to different external stimuli, undergoing corresponding alterations in glucose metabolism. In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), microglial glucose metabolic reprogramming is widespread. This reprogramming leads to changes in microglial function, exacerbating neuroinflammation and the accumulation of pathological products, thereby driving the progression of neurodegeneration. This review summarizes the specific alterations in glucose metabolism within microglia in AD, PD, ALS, and MS, as well as the corresponding treatments aimed at reprogramming glucose metabolism. Compounds that inhibit key glycolytic enzymes like hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), or activate regulators of energy metabolism such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), have shown significant potential in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, current research faces numerous challenges, including side effects and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of compounds. Screening relevant drugs from natural products, especially flavonoids, is a reliable approach. On the one hand, longtime herbal medical practices provide a certain degree of assurance regarding clinical safety, and their chemical properties contribute to effective BBB permeability. On the other hand, the concurrent anti-tumor and anti-neuroinflammatory activities of flavonoids suggest that regulation of glucose metabolism reprogramming might be a potential common mechanism of action. Notably, considering the dynamic nature of microglial metabolism, there is an urgent need to develop technologies for real-time monitoring of glucose metabolism processes, which would significantly advance research in this field.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39989429,Novel plasma biomarkers of amyloid plaque pathology and cortical thickness: Evaluation of the NULISA targeted proteomic platform in an ethnically diverse cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Proteomic evaluation of plasma samples could accelerate the identification of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. We evaluated the novel NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) proteomic method in an ethnically diverse cohort.
METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were measured with NULISA in the Human Connectome Project, a predominantly preclinical biracial community cohort in southwestern Pennsylvania. Selected biomarkers were additionally measured using Simoa and Quest immunoassays and compared.
RESULTS: On NULISA, phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau231, and p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT-tau) showed the top significant association with amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) status, followed by the neuroinflammation markers C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), chitotriosidase 1 (CHIT1) and interleukin-8 (CXCL8), and the synaptic marker neurogranin (NRGN). Biomarkers associated with cortical thickness included astrocytic protein chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), cytokine CD40 ligand (CD40LG), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the Aβ-associated metalloprotein TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotein 3), and ficolin 2 (FCN2). Furthermore, moderate to strong between-platform correlations were observed for various assays.
DISCUSSION: NULISA multiplexing advantage allowed concurrent assessment of established and novel plasma biomarkers of Aβ pathology and neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Classical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers measured using the NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) with next-generation sequencing readout (NULISAseq) CNS panel showed strong concordance with those measured using established immunoassay methods from Quanterix and Quest, with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) exhibiting the strongest correlation. NULISAseq proteomic analysis identified several plasma biomarkers strongly associated with AD pathology in a biracial community cohort of older adults. Notably, phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217), GFAP, and p-tau231 displayed the strongest association with amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was strongly associated with neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that plasma biomarker levels could be influenced by age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and self-identified race. Specifically, GFAP, NfL, and surfactant protein D (SFTPD) showed a strong association with age; CD63 and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) with self-identified race; synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) with APOE genotype; and serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) with significant sex differences.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40054233,Age at diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and subsequent risk of dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence regarding the association between Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) onset age and risk of incident dementia remains unexplored. The study sought to examine whether younger onset age of OSA is associated with a higher risk of incident dementia.
METHODS: This cohort study, based on the UK Biobank's prospective population data, excluded 445,023 participants due to baseline dementia diagnoses, incomplete covariate information, or pre-OSA onset dementia over a 12.6-year median follow-up. The research applied Cox regression and propensity score matching to explore the relationship between sleep apnea onset age and later development of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: In a controlled study contrasting those without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), those suffering from OSA showed markedly higher risks for developing all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD), with hazard ratios (HR) of 4.243 (95% CI: 3.678-4.897), 5.668 (95% CI: 4.380-7.336), and 6.064 (95% CI: 4.008-9.175) respectively. Following adjustment with propensity score matching, OSA patients younger than 52 presented the highest risk of all-cause dementia, with an adjusted HR of 2.256 (95% CI: 1.901-3.747). This trend was consistent for early-onset AD and VD in the same age group.
CONCLUSION: Younger age at OSA onset was associated with increased risk of dementia. Individuals with an onset age of OSA before 52 years of age may represent a particularly vulnerable population for dementia irrespective of subtypes and need careful monitoring and timely intervention to attenuate subsequent risk of incident dementia.",J Psychiatr Res,2024
40194251,Targeting α7nAChR for Neurotherapeutics: Mutagenesis and Electrophysiological Studies in Xenopus Oocytes (P9-2.001).,"OBJECTIVE: Identify and structurally characterize the RIC-3 a7 nAChR interface for future structure-based drug discovery efforts.
BACKGROUND: Ion channels have been implicated in numerous neurological conditions, including epilepsy, migraines, and addiction. Existing therapies targeting these channels frequently result in undesirable side effects, highlighting the need for more precise and effective treatments. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a key ion channel targeted for treating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Notably, the α7 nAChR subtype has been implicated in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Within the central nervous system, α7 nAChRs primarily exhibit modulatory functions, distinct from other nAChRs that directly mediate neurotransmission. Resistance to Inhibitors of Cholinesterase (RIC-3), regulates the surface expression of functional nAChRs on neuronal membranes, which is altered in various diseases. For developing potent and efficacious drugs with reduced side effects, the intracellular domain (ICD) of α7 nAChR, particularly its protein-protein interaction with RIC-3, presents a promising therapeutic target.
DESIGN/METHODS: We employed a pull-down assay using synthetic peptides of the α7 nAChR ICD to identify the segment mediating interaction with RIC-3. To investigate RIC-3's modulatory role in functional α7 nAChR expression, we injected corresponding cRNAs into Xenopus laevis oocytes and performed two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) recordings. Current amplitudes were acquired and analyzed using a TEV-200 amplifier, a Digidata 1440A data interface, and pClamp 10.4 software.
RESULTS: Our study identifies the L1-MX segment of α7 nAChR as sufficient to interact with RIC-3.
CONCLUSIONS: This provides the basis for future detailed mechanistic and structural studies aimed at developing compounds to mimic or interfere with this protein-protein interaction that is crucial for determining the amount of functional α7 nAChR on the plasma membrane. Our findings underscore the significance of the intracellular domain in ion channel function, paving the way for targeted therapies for various neurological disorders involving ion channels.

40116691,"A statistical method for predicting amyloid-β deposits from severity, extend, and ratio indices of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT.","BackgroundAmyloid-β (Aβ) deposit prediction accuracy is necessary for clinicians treating patients desiring Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying drugs. Aβ-PET imaging is useful for diagnosis, but high in cost compared to brain perfusion SPECT. However, SPECT displays regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and does not detect Aβ deposits, therefore requiring additional clinical information.ObjectiveThis article describes a novel statistical method to predict amyloid deposits via PET images (Aβ+ or Aβ-) using the three indices of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT - severity, extend, and ratio - for the three ROIs.MethodsCandidate patients (N = 114 patients [55% male], 81 Aβ+ 33 Aβ-, mean age 74.2 ± 6.6 years, mean MMSE score 23.7 ± 2.8) underwent MRI and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT scanning. After examining SPECT index, demographic, and age data, age and sex were treated as confounders in one, two, and three-index logistic additive models with severity, extend, and ratio as explanatory variables. Area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were used as statistical indices for model fitness and accuracies. Three-hold cross validation analyses were conducted to evaluate error rates.ResultsAccording to ROC analysis, best scores for fitness and accuracy were obtained from the three-index model with patients' age and sex for the configured ROIs including precuneus, posterior cingulate and temporal-parietal region of SPECT (AUC: 0.818, Sensitivity: 0.803, Specificity: 0.727).ConclusionsThis technique using <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT data can predict amyloid deposits with acceptable accuracy. To confirm the reliability and validity, a multicenter SPECT study is needed.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39763578,Dynamic changes and prognostic value of glutathione S-transferase alpha in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVES: Glutathione S-transferase alpha (GSTα) is an important antioxidant enzyme closely associated with the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The alterations in GSTα protein levels associated with Alzheimer's disease and their impact on cognitive abilities remain unclear. Thus, investigating the fluctuations of GSTα protein levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential.
METHODS: DATA were enrolled from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and we studied healthy individuals (as controls, a total of 54), patients with mild cognitive impairment (345), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (96) A one-year follow-up was conducted to collect data on the dynamic changes of GSTα protein levels in plasma and primary information data, and to analyze the correlation between the changes in GSTα protein levels before and after the follow-up and cognitive function and its predictive value.
RESULTS: Plasma GSTα protein levels were significantly lower in the AD group than in the CN group (0.94 vs1.05, p = 0.04) and the MCI group (0.94 vs1.09, p &lt; 0.001). Plasma GSTα protein level changes were positively correlated with altered MMSE levels in MCI and AD patients (r = 0.09, p = 0.04). The AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels for MCI was 0.63 (0.54-0.71), p = 0.02, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels for AD was 0.74 (0.69-0.80), p &lt; 0.001. At the same time, we plotted ROC curves for the difference in the change of plasma GSTα protein levels after 1 year of follow-up. The results showed that the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels change for MCI was 0.76 (0.696-0.83), p &lt; 0.001, and the AUC (95% CI) of the area under the prediction curve of plasma GSTα protein levels change for AD was 0.75 (0.69-0.80), p &lt; 0.001.
CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated notable differences in GSTα protein levels among patients with MCI and those with AD after a one-year follow-up period. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between changes in GST αprotein levels and the decline in both baseline and cognitive function. This suggests that GSTα protein could potentially act as a biomarker for both MCI and AD, offering fresh insights for early detection and intervention strategies.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40007076,"A Mediterranean-style diet protects against cognitive and behavioral deficits, adiposity, and Alzheimer's disease-related markers, compared to a macronutrient-matched typical American diet in C57BL/6J mice.","BackgroundResearch suggests that modifying risk factors may prevent or delay up to 40% of dementia cases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, understanding the potential of healthful dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean diet (MD), in AD prevention is crucial. While supplementation of individual Mediterranean foods has demonstrated efficacy in reducing AD biomarkers and cognitive impairment in rodents, the effects of a comprehensive MD warrant further investigation. Additionally, while rodent studies often use a ""Western diet"" as a model for the typical American diet (TAD), these diets generally exceed the macronutrient densities of typical American consumption, particularly in fats and carbohydrates.ObjectiveTo better reflect human diets, we developed two diets for mice that more closely mirrored the macronutrient composition of the traditional MD or the TAD, each with matched macronutrient profiles (50% kcal from carbohydrates, 35% kcal from fat, 15% kcal from protein), and distinct food sources from Mediterranean regions or the U.S., respectively.MethodsMale C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to one diet (MD or TAD) at weaning (21 days of age), which they consumed for six months.ResultsCompared to the TAD, MD animals had lower body weight, abdominal and hepatic fat, serum TNF-α, and central Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, while also exhibiting enhanced exploratory behavior, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and preserved spatial memory. The MD also protected against LPS-induced central inflammation and BDNF loss.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that a comprehensive MD provides protection against metabolic and AD-related markers in wildtype mice, despite matched caloric availability to the TAD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40145346,Commonly prescribed multi-medication therapies exert sex-specific effects on Alzheimer's disease pathology and metabolomic profiles in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice: Implications for personalized therapeutics in aging.,"INTRODUCTION: Polypharmacy is common among older adults and people with dementia. Multi-medication therapy poses risks of harm but also targets comorbidities and risk factors associated with dementia, offering therapeutic potential.
METHODS: We evaluated the effects of two polypharmacy regimens and monotherapies on male and female App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> knock-in mice. We assessed functional, emotional, and cognitive outcomes;amyloid pathology; and serum metabolomics profiles.
RESULTS: A combination of metoprolol, simvastatin, aspirin, paracetamol, and citalopram improved memory, reduced amyloid burden and neuroinflammation, and modulated AD-associated metabolomic signatures in male mice, with negligible effects in female mice. Substituting two cardiovascular drugs impacted emotional domains but worsened memory, predominantly in female mice. In males, monotherapies could not explain the combination effects, suggesting drug synergy, whereas in female mice, certain monotherapy effects were lost when combined.
DISCUSSION: This study uncovers the sex-specific effects of polypharmacy in an AD model, identifying mechanisms and biomarkers that can guide gender-specific use of medicines in dementia prevention and management.
HIGHLIGHTS: Two polypharmacy combinations show sex-specific effects on AD pathology and serum metabolomic profiles. Metoprolol+simvastatin+aspirin+paracetamol+citalopram improves memory and amyloid pathology in male mice. Replacing metoprolol and simvastatin with enalapril and atorvastatin eliminates benefits in male mice and impairs memory in female mice. Selected monotherapies produce sex-specific effects but only partially explain the outcomes of the combinations. Metabolomic pathways in serum indicate possible mechanisms and biomarkers for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of personalized therapies in aging and dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39801363,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) From a Human at Low Risk for Alzheimer's Disease Improves Short-Term Recognition Memory and Increases Neuroinflammation in a 3xTg AD Mouse Model.,"Human microbiota-associated murine models, using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from human donors, help explore the microbiome's role in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examines how gut bacteria from donors with protective factors against AD influence behavior and brain pathology in an AD mouse model. Female 3xTgAD mice received weekly FMT for 2 months from (i) an 80-year-old AD patient (AD-FMT), (ii) a cognitively healthy 73-year-old with the protective APOEe2 allele (APOEe2-FMT), (iii) a 22-year-old healthy donor (Young-FMT), and (iv) untreated mice (Mice-FMT). Behavioral assessments included novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze, open-field, and elevated plus maze tests; brain pathology (amyloid and tau), neuroinflammation (in situ autoradiography of the 18 kDa translocator protein in the hippocampus); and gut microbiota were analyzed. APOEe2-FMT improved short-term memory in the NOR test compared to AD-FMT, without significant changes in other behavioral tests. This was associated with increased neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, but no effect was detected on brain amyloidosis and tauopathy. Specific genera, such as Parabacteroides and Prevotellaceae_UGC001, were enriched in the APOEe2-FMT group and associated with neuroinflammation, while genera like Desulfovibrio were reduced and linked to decreased neuroinflammation. Gut microbiota from a donor with a protective factor against AD improved short-term memory and induced neuroinflammation in regions strategic to AD. The association of several genera with neuroinflammation in the APOEe2-FMT group suggests a collegial effect of the transplanted microbiome rather than a single-microbe driver effect. These data support an association between gut bacteria, glial cell activation, and cognitive function in AD.",Genes Brain Behav,2025
39791143,Body composition differences in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"BACKGROUND: Research on body composition and fat distribution in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has presented conflicting findings.
OBJECTIVE: Compare body composition and anthropometric measurements in older adults with and without AD.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA standards. MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILACS, WPRIM, and the Spanish Bibliographic Index of Health Sciences were searched up to September 2024, considering observational studies that compared body composition between AD groups and controls. Outcomes included body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), impedance, resistance, and reactance. The methodological quality and level of evidence were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute scale and GRADE, respectively. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to calculate mean differences (MD).
RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 2761 older adults were included. Older adult women with AD showed a lower body fat percentage (p < 0.01; MD = -5.07) and BMI (p = 0.05; MD = -1.28) compared to controls. Older adult men with AD had higher impedance (p = 0.01; MD = 2.05), resistance (p = 0.02; MD = 45.10), and lower reactance (p = 0.03; MD = -2.05) compared to controls. No significant differences in body fat percentage or BMI were found between older adults with and without AD, regardless of gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with AD showed lower body fat percentage and BMI, while men with AD had higher impedance, resistance, and lower reactance. These factors should be included in geriatric assessments for AD patients, though further research is needed to understand their link to cognitive outcomes in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39891801,NXP032 Improves Memory Impairment Through Suppression of Tauopathy in PS19 Mice and Attenuates Okadaic Acid-Induced Tauopathy in SH-SY5Y Cells.,"Tauopathy is widely observed in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and characterized by abnormal tau protein phosphorylation, aggregation and its accumulation as a form of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) in the brain. However, there are no effective treatments targeting tau pathology in the AD. Vitamin C is known to reduce tauopathy and modulate one of its regulators called glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in the body. Nevertheless, vitamin C has a limitation of its stability during metabolism due to its chemical properties. Thus, in the current study, NXP032 (a vitamin C/aptamer complex) was tested as a candidate for tau-targeting treatment because it can preserve antioxidative efficacy of vitamin C before it can reach the target tissue. In this context, the current study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of NXP032 on tauopathy in vivo and in vitro. As a result, NXP032 attenuated cognitive and memory decline and reduced NFT and tau hyperphosphorylation in the P301S mutant human tau transgenic mice (or called PS19 mice). In addition, NXP032 suppressed neuroinflammation found in the PS19 mice. Furthermore, NXP032 protected SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells from okadaic acid (OKA)-induced cytotoxicity. Especially, 10 ng/ml of NXP032 reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and GSK3 activation though its phosphorylation at Tyr216 site which were promoted by OKA treatment in the SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our results suggest that NXP032 might be a potential therapy for AD and tauopathy-related neurodegenerative disorders as well.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2025
39975468,Meaningful to whom? Minimal clinically important differences and the priorities of individuals living with dementia for everyday function.,"UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a significant impact on an individual's functional cognitive abilities, highlighting the need to prioritize measures of function in evaluating minimally clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in AD/ADRD research. Input directly from individuals living with AD/ADRD on measures of function are lacking in MCID discussions, including what it means to live with AD/ADRD and what type and degree of improvements are most meaningful across the disease continuum. Most measures for assessing function in AD/ADRD trials are largely focused on basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADL, IADL), which lack aspects of everyday function that matter most to individuals living with AD/ADRD. Expanding outcome evaluation to other dimensions of everyday function and diversifying measurement approaches is essential for optimizing inclusion of personally meaningful aspects of everyday function prioritized by individuals living with AD/ADRD and improving detection of potentially more sensitive changes in functioning. This perspective outlines four directions to expand and integrate what matters most to individuals living with AD/ADRD into trial outcome evaluation, including (1) consideration of how what matters most to individuals living with AD/ADRD may change across the disease continuum from mild to advanced dementia, (2) identification and evaluation of goals around strengths-based domains such as social participation rather than solely emphasizing deficits and losses, (3) utilization of goal-attainment scaling to more specifically match individually-specific functional goals, and (4) strengthening the inclusion and use of self-report and performance-based measures of function and triangulating these measures with informant-report measures.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a significant impact on an individual' functional cognitive abilities, of which changes in these abilities are measured through detection of minimally clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds to determine the effectiveness of AD/ADRD clinical trials.Widely used measures for assessing MCID thresholds in AD/ADRD trials focus on basic and instrumental activities of daily living, presenting opportunities to expand measurement of MCID to account for other dimensions of everyday function that are prioritized by individuals living with AD/ADRD.To expand outcome evaluation and improve integration of aspects of functioning that matter most to people living with AD/ADRD, we identify opportunities to incorporate more diverse strategies via goal-attainment scaling, self-report, and performance-based measures as appropriate. We also highlight the importance of incorporating strengths-based domains such as social participation, moving beyond deficit-focused assessment of functioning.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39935341,Prevalence of subjective cognitive decline and its association with physical health problems among urban community dwelling elderly population in South India.,"INTRODUCTION: No studies in India have explored subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a hallmark of stage II of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to assess the prevalence and correlates of SCD in a South Indian, urban, elderly population.
METHODS: We screened 403 individuals 60 years of age and older using the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ) and measured objective cognition with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physical health parameters were evaluated for all participants.
RESULTS: Among the participants, 377 (93.5%) reported subjective memory complaints. Of the 26 individuals without SCD, 15(57.7%) had objective cognitive impairment (MoCA <25). A total of 182 participants (45.2%) were identified with SCD. Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with fewer SCD reports and better cognitive performance (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is highly prevalent among older adults. Screening for SCD can help identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. SCD assessement combined with cost-effective biomarkers that confirms AD will help individuals to be identified for disease-modifying therapies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Nearly half of older adults population screened has reported subjective cognitive decline (SCD), highlighting the widespread occurrence of SCD in urban South India. Participants with higher educational attainment had significantly fewer memory complaints and performed better on cognitive assessments. SCD was prevalent even among individuals without major comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension and those who were on regular treatment for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Identifying subjective cognitive decline (SCD) can facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of cognitive disorders and help delay progression to dementia. This highlights the importance of developing and implementing improved public health strategies to address these challenges. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to explore the progression of SCD to dementia, focusing on the interplay between cognitive health, biomarkers, and educational factors in the Indian population.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39749254,Association between Alzheimer's disease pathologic products and age and a pathologic product-based diagnostic model for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a major negative impact on people's quality of life, life, and health. More research is needed to determine the relationship between age and the pathologic products associated with AD. Meanwhile, the construction of an early diagnostic model of AD, which is mainly characterized by pathological products, is very important for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
METHOD: We collected clinical study data from September 2005 to August 2024 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using correlation analysis method like cor function, we analyzed the pathology products (t-Tau, p-Tau, and Aβ proteins), age, gender, and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the ADNI data. Next, we investigated the relationship between pathologic products and age in the AD and non-AD groups using linear regression. Ultimately, we used these features to build a diagnostic model for AD.
RESULTS: A total of 1,255 individuals were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 73.27 [7.26] years; 691male [55.1%]; 564 female [44.9%]). The results of the correlation analysis showed that the correlations between pathologic products and age were, in descending order, Tau (Corr=0.75), p-Tau (Corr=0.71), and Aβ (Corr=0.54). In the AD group, t-Tau protein showed a tendency to decrease with age, but it was not statistically significant. p-Tau protein levels similarly decreased with age and its decrease was statistically significant. In contrast to Tau protein, in the AD group, Aβ levels increased progressively with age. In the non-AD group, the trend of pathologic product levels with age was consistently opposite to that of the AD group. We finally screened the optimal AD diagnostic model (AUC=0.959) based on the results of correlation analysis and by using the Xgboost algorithm and SVM algorithm.
CONCLUSION: In a novel finding, we observed that Tau protein and Aβ had opposite trends with age in both the AD and non-AD groups. The linear regression curves of the AD and non-AD groups had completely opposite trends. Through a machine learning approach, we constructed an AD diagnostic model with excellent performance based on the selected features.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40085238,High resolution autoradiography of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 and [<sup>18</sup>F]Flortaucipir shows similar neurofibrillary tangle binding patterns preferentially recognizing middling neurofibrillary tangle maturity.,"Recent developments in tau positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have enhanced the visualization of tau aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The maturity level of neurofibrillary tangles can affect its recognition by biomarkers. Early detection of tau aggregates regarding tangle pathology is of interest in early diagnosis and comparison of tau radiotracers in this aspect is important. This study focused on head to head pathologic comparison of [<sup>18</sup>F]MK-6240 and [<sup>18</sup>F]Flortaucipir postmortem binding as seen on high resolution autoradiography as compared to CP-13 (early tangle maturity) and PHF-1 (middling tangle maturity) immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate the tangle maturity pathology specificity of binding for tau aggregates in AD, atypical AD and non-AD tauopathies. Analyses were performed on serial 5 μm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human brain sections acquired from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. Visual assessment of colocalization with IHC as well as quantitative analyses were used. Evaluation of the tracers' off-target binding profiles were performed. Both tracers had similar binding properties for tau aggregates with preference to middling tangle maturity as shown by comparison to immunohistochemical distributions. Both the tracers showed strong binding to AD tau aggregates and no or minimal binding to non-AD tauopathies which corroborates with other studies.",Acta Neuropathol,2025
40170406,The association between measures of sleepiness and subjective cognitive decline symptoms in a diverse population of cognitively normal older adults.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is associated with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Suboptimal sleep is also a risk factor for cognitive decline, but with unclear relationship to SCD. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study in a biracial research cohort of 148 cognitively normal older adults who underwent quantification of SCD (Cognitive Change Index; CCI), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale; ESS), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), and amyloid/tau PET. ESS score was associated with total, amnestic, and non-amnestic CCI scores, after adjustment for GDS, amyloid/tau burden, and race. This supports future longitudinal work on how sleepiness impacts SCD outcomes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39697158,Defining benefit: Clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway.,"To understand the potential benefits of emerging Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies within and beyond clinical trial settings, there is a need to advance current outcome measurements into meaningful information relevant to all stakeholders. The relationship between the impact on disease biology and clinically measurable outcomes in cognition, function, and behavior must be considered when defining the meaningful benefit of early AD therapies. In this review, we discuss: (1) the lack of consideration for biomarkers in the current concept of meaningfulness in AD; (2) the lack of gold standards for determining minimal biologically and clinically important differences (MBCIDs) in AD trials; (3) how the treatment benefits of disease-modifying treatments are cumulative and increase over time; and (4) the different concepts of meaningfulness among key stakeholders. This review utilizes the future clinical biological framework of AD and aims to further integrate and expand the parameters of meaningful benefits toward a precision medicine framework. HIGHLIGHTS: Definition of meaningful benefit from Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment varies across disease stage and stakeholder perspectives. Observable and meaningful outcomes must consider the clinical-biological nature of AD. Statistically significant effects or outcomes do not always equate to clinically meaningfulness. Assessment tools must reflect stage-specific subtle changes following treatment. Real-world evidence will support consensus, definition, and interpretation of clinical meaningfulness.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39928878,Astrocytic EphA4 signaling is important for the elimination of excitatory synapses in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cell surface receptors, including erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A4 (EphA4), are important in regulating hippocampal synapse loss, which is the key driver of memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the cell-specific roles and mechanisms of EphA4 are unclear. Here, we show that EphA4 expression is elevated in hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in AD conditions. Specific knockout of astrocytic EphA4 ameliorates excitatory synapse loss in the hippocampus in AD transgenic mouse models. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed that EphA4 inhibition specifically decreases a reactive astrocyte subpopulation with enriched complement signaling, which is associated with synapse elimination by astrocytes in AD. Importantly, astrocytic EphA4 knockout in an AD transgenic mouse model decreases complement tagging on excitatory synapses and excitatory synapses within astrocytes. These findings suggest an important role of EphA4 in the astrocyte-mediated elimination of excitatory synapses in AD and highlight the crucial role of astrocytes in hippocampal synapse maintenance in AD.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025
39922446,Empirical classification of neuropsychiatric symptoms and association of classes with diagnostic progression and cognitive decline in MCI and AD populations.,"BACKGROUND: To identify classes of cognitively impaired older individuals based on their neuropsychiatric symptoms(NPS) and to investigate the contribution of NPS class to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease(AD) risk in mild cognitive impairment(MCI).
METHODS: Our study included 1,472 participants(age range 55-91) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) who were diagnosed with MCI or mild AD and had a complete neuropsychiatric Inventory at their baseline visit. We employed latent class analysis to categorize groups by NPS patterns. Linear mixed models of repeated measures(LMMRMs) were used to compare changes in cognitive performance across 5years as a function of NPS class. Subsequently, the Cox proportional hazards model was employed in individuals with MCI to assess whether rate of conversion to AD differed across the NPS groups.
RESULTS: We identified three latent classes of NPS: No NPS (n=799, 51.7%), Apathy/Affective (n=572, 39.8%), Complex (n=108, 8.5%) NPS. In longitudinal analyses we observed interactions between class and time, indicating accelerated cognitive decline in memory and executive function in the Apathy/Affective class. In MCI, hazard ratios for conversion to AD were 1.39(95% CI: 1.10-1.76) for the Apathy/Affective class and 2.03(95% CI: 1.33-3.10) for the Complex class compared to the No NPS group after adjusting for age, sex, education, global cognition, and ApoE4 positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Among cognitively impaired elderly, empirically derived clusters of NPS profiles were associated with cognitive decline and risk of conversion from MCI to AD. Such NPS classes may reflect specific neurobiological mechanisms within or related to AD-related neurodegeneration. Further studies with biological markers are needed to clarify these neurobiological mechanisms.",Biol Psychiatry,2025
40164762,Impairment of theta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region may mediate age-dependent movement alternations in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Clinical evidences indicate that multifaceted gait abnormalities may manifest in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, which are associated with cognitive decline. Although the correlation between hippocampal theta power and locomotion has been known for a long time, the mechanisms by how hippocampal impairment participates in the altered gait seen in AD is not fully understood. To explore the manifestations of gait disorders in AD, we characterized gait performance in 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old male 5xFAD and control mice in the semi-automated, highly sensitive, Catwalk XT system. The 5xFAD mice displayed a decrease in kinetic parameters (average speed and cadence), and spatial parameters (paw area), while the temporal parameters (stance and swing time) were significantly increased. The parameters of interlimb coordination also displayed deficits. The majority of impairment variables related to the slow speed in 5xFAD mice at 9-month-old. We further explored the theta oscillations in the brain by in vivo tetrode recording of the hippocampal CA1. The results showed that the theta oscillations reduced in the hippocampal CA1 of 5xFAD mice, which related to the gait impairments. In conclusion, gait impairments started at 6 months of age, manifested at 9 months of age in 5xFAD mice. A reduction in theta oscillation power of the hippocampal CA1 may be responsible for the gait impairments.",Sci Rep,2025
40194163,"Personalized Alzheimer's Risk Reduction Software Improves Calculated Alzheimer's Risk: A Digital, Decentralized, Randomized Controlled Trial (P1-3.004).","OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of automated digital health risk reduction software compared to a time-neutral control in lowering calculated Alzheimer's risk.
BACKGROUND: Over 300 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology starting silently in their brains decades before symptoms begin. Research shows that 45% of dementia cases may be preventable by addressing modifiable risk factors, and growing evidence supports the efficacy of multimodal risk reduction care for at-risk individuals. With AD prevalence nearly surpassing capacity of available specialists, a scalable solution is needed. Digital devices may serve as a mechanism for broad and cost-effective dissemination of risk reduction interventions.
DESIGN/METHODS: RetainYourBrain is an interactive, evidence-based, online software application that identifies users' risk factors, sets priorities for improvement, educates, provides automated, customized recommendations and support, and longitudinally monitors outcomes. We evaluated its effectiveness on calculated Alzheimer's risk (Alzheimer's National University-AD Risk Index [ANU-ADRI]) in a 6-month randomized controlled trial against a time-neutral control in people ≥53 years with a family history of AD (n=987). Analysis of covariance models, with treatment arm as the main factor and baseline risk score as the covariate, were used to evaluate treatment effects on the ANU-ADRI score.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention and control arms. Participants were largely married/partnered, well-educated, and White (mean age 64.2 years; SD=6.9) and 75% of the sample completed final assessments (n=737 analyzable). This personalized digital health intervention significantly reduced ANU-ADRI total score after 6-months (ß=0.86, 95%CI=[0.02, 1.55], p=0.014) versus controls.
CONCLUSIONS: RetainYourBrain effectively promotes behavior change in lifestyle domains linked to dementia risk. This innovative software offers a convenient, automated and cost-effective method for lowering AD risk that can be implemented more widely than otherwise possible in traditional, face-to-face health care encounters (ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT06027320).

40002692,Beyond Amyloid and Tau: The Critical Role of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is traditionally viewed through the lens of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, implicating amyloid-beta and tau protein aggregates as the main pathological culprits. However, burgeoning research points to the brain's resident immune cells, microglia, as critical players in AD pathogenesis, progression, and potential therapeutic interventions. This review examines the dynamic roles of microglia within the intricate framework of AD. We detail the involvement of these immune cells in neuroinflammation, explaining how their activation and response fluctuations may influence the disease trajectory. We further elucidate the complex relationship between microglia and amyloid-beta pathology. This study highlights the dual nature of these cells, which contribute to both aggregation and clearance of the amyloid-beta protein. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the interplay between microglia and tau unveils the significant, yet often overlooked, impact of this interaction on neurodegeneration in AD. Shifting from the conventional therapeutic approaches, we assess the current AD treatments primarily targeting amyloid and tau and introduce novel strategies that involve manipulating microglial functions. These innovative methods herald a potential paradigm shift in the management of AD. Finally, we explore the burgeoning field of precision diagnosis and the pursuit of robust AD biomarkers. We underline how a more profound comprehension of microglial biology could enrich these essential areas, potentially paving the way for more accurate diagnostic tools and tailored treatment strategies. In conclusion, this review expands on the conventional perspective of AD pathology and treatment, drawing attention to the multifaceted roles of microglia. As we continue to enhance our understanding of these cells, microglial-focused therapeutic interventions emerge as a promising frontier to bolster our arsenal to fight against AD.",Biomedicines,2025
39988568,Influence of cognitive impairment and race on plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in two diverse cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Factors influencing plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers remain incompletely understood. Here we evaluated Fujirebio plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in two diverse cohorts among whom 91% underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.
METHODS: Non-Hispanic White (NHW, n = 113), Black/African American (B/AA, n = 66), and Chinese American (ChA, n = 38) participants recruited from two universities were included. We examined if plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> correlated with CSF and clinical factors, differed between racial groups, and associated with novel CSF proteins.
RESULTS: CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> strongly correlated with CSF p-Tau<sub>217</sub> (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.912) which moderately correlated with plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.694). Plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> levels were higher with greater cognitive impairment but lower in B/AA than NHW participants even after adjusting for CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>. This resulted in greater positive predictive value for NHW than B/AA participants, and could be mediated by complement or lysosomal pathways.
DISCUSSION: Severity of cognitive impairment and race both influence plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> levels beyond race-associated differences in CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive impairment associates with plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> independent of CSF biomarkers. Black/African Americans had lower plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> than non-Hispanic White Americans. CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> could not explain lower plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> in Black/African Americans. Plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> difference results in more false positive cases according to race. Novel CSF processes were associated with race-related plasma p-Tau<sub>217</sub> difference.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40091774,Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts.,"OBJECTIVE: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies.
METHODS: Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, APOE genotype, and cognition.
RESULTS: The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67-75, p = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, p < 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with lower CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD.
INTERPRETATION: Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol,2025
40120077,The relationship between kidney health and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are multi-faceted disorders influenced by and affecting more than just the brain and nervous system. Here, we provide a review of the potential links, including mechanistic and genetic, between kidney health and neurodegeneration, mainly dementia and the two most prevalent late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We also discuss lines of evidence from various study designs and methodologies that either support or do not support an association between kidney health and neurodegeneration. We conclude with a summary of current gaps and provide possible ways forward to overcome them in future research. The goal of this review is to encourage further exploration of the relationship between these two biological systems to better elucidate potential actionable options to improve brain health.",Brain,2025
40095669,Development and validation of the Chinese Naming Test (CNT): Diagnostic efficacy and correlation with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"BackgroundNeuropsychological assessments are essential tools for the screening and diagnosis of patients with cognitive impairments. Cultural background differences significantly affect cognitive test performance. For China, which is rapidly aging, a culturally adaptive picture naming test is urgently needed.ObjectiveThis study aims to develop a Chinese naming test (CNT) adapted to the cultural background of Chinese people and to explore its correlation with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.MethodsA total of 1459 participants were recruited, including 744 with normal cognition (NC), 492 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 223 with dementia. All participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The diagnostic capability of CNT was determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. Part of participants underwent amyloid-β (Aβ) PET scans, tau-PET scans, and MRI scans. The relationships between CNT scores and Aβ and tau deposition, as well as brain structural changes, were analyzed.ResultsThe diagnostic capability of CNT for MCI showed a sensitivity of 68.7%, specificity of 75.6%, and AUC of 0.81; for dementia, the sensitivity was 72.7%, specificity was 89.5%, and AUC was 0.89. The correlation coefficient between CNT scores and brain Aβ burden was -0.11 (p = 0.024). CNT scores correlated with tau burden in different Braak stages (p < 0.05). The correlation coefficient between CNT scores and hippocampus atrophy was -0.15 (p = 0.003).ConclusionsThe CNT has good diagnostic performance in detecting MCI and dementia in Chinese population. There is a correlation between CNT scores and AD imaging markers, indicating that the CNT might has potential value in predicting cognitive changes and disease progression.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39887820,Cranial bone maneuver ameliorates Alzheimer's disease pathology via enhancing meningeal lymphatic drainage function.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia. Recent research highlights meningeal lymphatics as key regulators in neurological diseases, suggesting that enhancing their drainage function could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrated that cranial bone transport can improve meningeal lymphatic drainage function and promote ischemic stroke recovery.
METHODS: This study defined cranial bone maneuver (CBM) technique. After osteotomy, a small circular bone flap was made and attached to an external fixator for subsequent maneuver in a controlled fashion for a defined period using 5xFAD mice.
RESULTS: CBM treatment improved memory functions, reduced amyloid deposits, and promoted meningeal lymphatic drainage function. CBM induced cascades of inflammatory and lymphangiogenic processes in skull and meninges. Meningeal lymphatics are indispensable elements for the therapeutic effects of CBM.
DISCUSSION: CBM might be a promising innovative therapy for AD management, warranting further clinical investigation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cranial bone maneuver (CBM) alleviated memory deficits and amyloid depositions. CBM promoted meningeal lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic drainage function. The beneficial effects of CBM lasted for a long time following the CBM procedures. CBM induced cascades of inflammatory and lymphangiogenic processes in the meninges.

39962385,Identifying risk factors for Alzheimer's disease from multivariate longitudinal clinical data using temporal pattern mining.,"BACKGROUND: Patient data contain a wealth of information that could aid in understanding the onset and progression of disease. However, the task of modelling clinical data, which consist of multiple heterogeneous time series of different lengths, measured at different time intervals, is a complex one. A growing body of research has applied temporal pattern mining to this problem to identify common patterns in clinical attributes over time. However, the vast majority of these algorithms use techniques that are not ideally suited to clinical data. We present an efficient and scalable framework designed specifically for temporal pattern mining of real-world clinical data. Our framework combines temporal abstraction, an extended version of the efficient pattern-growth algorithm, TPMiner, the concepts of relative risk and the odds ratio to identify interesting and high-risk patterns and multiprocessing to improve computational efficiency. A complete set of cut-off values for discretisation and interpretation of the data is provided and is applicable to studies on ageing populations in general. We name this framework Clinical Temporal Pattern Mining or C-TPM.
RESULTS: The framework is applied to data from two real-world studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The patterns discovered were predictive of AD in survival analysis models with a Concordance index of up to 0.87 and contain clinically relevant variables. A visualisation module provides a clear picture of the discovered patterns for ease of interpretability.
CONCLUSIONS: The framework provides an effective and scalable method of modelling multivariate, longitudinal clinical data and can identify patterns in uncommon diseases and those that progress slowly over time. It is generalisable to clinical data from other medical domains as well as non-clinical data.",BMC Bioinformatics,2025
40025713,"Healthcare providers perspectives and perceptions of dementia diagnosis and management at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.","BACKGROUND: The rising number of older people, including those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) highlights the need for an improved clinical diagnosis and management of the diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To understand and describe healthcare providers' perceptions and practices regarding AD/ADRD diagnosis and care in Kenya, not previously reported.
METHODS: This was an ethnographic study involving observations and semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers working at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN) Kenya. Twenty-one healthcare providers were purposively recruited and interviewed in English, with the data transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using Nvivo version 14.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal that AKUHN's dementia diagnostic pathway aligns with universal best practice models and involves multidisciplinary care. Yet, healthcare providers noted that this level of care is not representative of most public hospitals in Kenya, where a lack of diagnostic equipment and trained staff severely limits patient access to timely dementia care. In addition, new medications that can slow AD/ADRD progression, are not readily available in Africa, including Kenya. We also identified barriers to timely diagnosis and care such as: lack of dementia policy and guidelines, limited expertise of healthcare providers, high cost of care, and sociocultural factors, including stigma.
CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the need for the Kenyan government and relevant stakeholders to develop social and healthcare policies and allocate resources to raise awareness about dementia and combat stigma; train healthcare providers; improve early detection and service delivery through access to diagnostic tools, and establish clear guidelines/protocols for AD/ADRD care.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40156267,Sociodemographic modifiers of effects of statin initiation on dementia incidence: An emulated trial design in a large health care member population with 10+ years of follow-up.,"INTRODUCTION: Mixed evidence on how statin use affects risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) may reflect heterogeneity across sociodemographic factors. Few studies have sufficient power to evaluate effect modifiers.
METHODS: Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members (n = 705,061; n = 202,937 with sociodemographic surveys) who initiated statins from 2001 to 2010 were matched on age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with non-initiators and followed through 2020 for incident ADRD. Inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate effect modification by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, income, and immigrant generation.
RESULTS: Statin initiation (vs non-initiation) was not associated with ADRD incidence in any of the 32 subgroups (p > .05). Hazard ratios ranged from 0.964 (95% CI: 0.923 to 1.006) among Asian-identified participants to 1.122 (95% CI: 0.995 to 1.265) in the highest income category.
DISCUSSION: Sociodemographic heterogeneity appears to have little to no influence on the relationship between statin initiation and dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: The study includes a large and diverse cohort from Kaiser Permanente (N = 705,061). An emulated trial design of statin initiation on dementia incidence was used.

39791378,"Associations between lifelong cognitive reserve, Alzheimer's disease-related plasma biomarkers, and cognitive function in dementia-free older adults: A population-based study.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR), typically measured through socio-behavioral proxies, can partially explain better cognitive performance despite underlying brain aging or neuropathology.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of CR with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive function while considering Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 4706 dementia-free individuals from MIND-China. Data on AD-related plasma biomarkers were available for 1204 individuals. A composite CR score was generated by integrating education, occupational complexity, mental activity, and social support, using structural equation modeling. A neuropsychological test battery was used to assess the function of episodic memory, executive function, attention, and verbal fluency. MCI and subtypes of MCI were defined according to the Petersen's criteria. Data were analyzed using general linear and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Controlling for AD-related plasma biomarkers, higher educational attainment was associated with better performance in all four examined cognitive domains (p < 0.001) and with lower likelihoods of MCI, amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-aMCI (p < 0.05); late-life mental activity was significantly related to lower likelihoods of MCI and aMCI (p < 0.05). Midlife occupation and late-life social support were not significantly associated with MCI or subtypes (p > 0.05). Higher composite CR scores were related to better performance in all the examined cognitive domains as well as lower likelihoods of MCI, aMCI, and non-aMCI (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Greater composite CR, derived from the CR indicators across different stages of the lifespan, is associated with better cognitive function independent of AD-related plasma biomarkers, driven mainly by early-life educational attainment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

39844303,Exploring sex differences in Alzheimer's disease: a comprehensive analysis of a large patient cohort from a memory unit.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the leading cause of dementia worldwide, and projections estimate over 150 million patients by 2050. AD prevalence is notably higher in women, nearly twice that of men, with discernible sex differences in certain risk factors. To enhance our understanding of how sex influences the characteristics of AD patients and its potential impact on the disease trajectory, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of demographic, clinical, cognitive, and genetic data from a sizable and well-characterized cohort of AD dementia patients at a memory clinic in Barcelona, Spain.
METHODS: The study cohort comprised individuals with probable and possible AD dementia with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score between 1 and 3 diagnosed at the Memory Unit from Ace Alzheimer Center Barcelona, Spain, between 2008 and 2018. We obtained cognitive baseline data and follow up scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the CDR scale, and the neuropsychological battery used in our center (NBACE). We employed various statistical techniques to assess the impact of sex on cognitive evolution in these dementia patients, accounting for other sex-related risk factors identified through Machine Learning methods.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised a total of 6108 individuals diagnosed with AD dementia during the study period (28.4% males and 71.6% females). MMSE scores exhibited an average decline of approximately two units per year, unaffected by sex. Similarly, the decline in most neuropsychological functions assessed by NBACE did not exhibit significant differences between males and females. However, we observed that women diagnosed with mild AD dementia progressed more rapidly based on their CDR score (HR = 2.57, 95%CI:2.33-2.84) than men (HR = 2.03, 95%CI: 1.71-2.41) (p-interaction = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not strongly support the notion that sex significantly modifies the clinical progression of AD dementia based on cognitive data. Further research is essential to validate whether women with mild AD dementia indeed progress more rapidly than men at a similar stage and to delve into the potential underlying reasons for this finding.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39865683,Targeting SPI1 to mitigate amyloid-β pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"SPI1, a transcription factor implicated in myeloid cell development, has emerged as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent in vivo studies reveal that Spi1 knockdown in mice exacerbates AD pathology by increasing amyloid-β aggregation and gliosis while Spi1 overexpression ameliorates these features. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that Spi1 regulates microglial immune response, complement activation, and phagocytosis. SPI1 regulation of these processes may explain how SPI1 affects AD risk. Further studies, including human validation, are needed to explore the dynamic influence of SPI1 across AD stages, its applicability to clinical settings, and its potential as a therapeutic target.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40193887,Real-World Use of Alpha-Synuclein Seeding Amplification Assay in a Behavioral Neurology Clinic (P10-3.018).,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize use and impact on clinical decision-making of the alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay (SAA) in a tertiary behavioral neurology clinic.
BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SAA is a new marker with high specificity for Lewy body disease (LBD) in well-defined research cohorts, but real-world use data are sparse.
DESIGN/METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort of all cases who had the SAA test (SynTap, Amprion) performed at our behavioral neurology clinic. Medical records were reviewed for diagnosis, clinical syndrome/affected cognitive domain(s), cognitive tests, presence of core LBD features and other symptoms, MRI, PET and SPECT imaging, Alzheimer's disease biofluid markers, and clinical decisions made following the SAA result.
RESULTS: In our first year of use, the SAA was performed for 21 patients. Most were men (76%). Patients at time of testing were between 53-86 years old (mean 74). Mild cognitive impairment was the most common diagnosis (71%) followed by dementia (19%) and subjective cognitive impairment or normal (9.5%). The SAA was abnormal in 9 patients (43%). The p(181)-tau/amyloid-beta (42) ratio was abnormal in 44% of SAA-positive cases and in 45% of SAA-negative cases. In SAA-positive cases, 5 met the core features from McKeith et al. for probable and 2 for possible LBD; in SAA-negative cases, none were probable and 7 were possible LBD. Of the cohort, 17 had questionable or mild motor parkinsonism. Clinical syndromes varied and included amnestic, multidomain (2/6 positive), non-amnestic, dysexecutive and behavioral (0/5), logopenic primary progressive aphasia (1/1), corticobasal syndrome (1/1), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (0/1), multiple system atrophy (0/1), and Parkinson's disease (0/1); there were no purely amnestic patients tested. Subsequent clinical decisions included additional diagnostic tests and medication changes (lecanemab included).
CONCLUSIONS: The SAA adds diagnostic information in early-stage, heterogeneous clinical presentations and may alter clinical decisions.

39956938,Frailty increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease in non-demented individuals: A longitudinal cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Frailty, which is considered a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia, continues to generate debate when it comes to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, the underlying pathological mechanisms linking frailty to AD remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between frailty and the risk of AD while elucidating the connections between frailty, AD biomarkers, and cognitive function.
METHODS: Total of 829 non-frail (261 robust, 568 pre-frail) and 94 frail individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were recruited. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression assessed AD risk across diverse frail statuses in 923 non-demented individuals. Multiple linear regression, mixed effects models and causal mediation analyses bootstrapped 10,000 iterations were conducted to examined underlying associations.
RESULTS: The frail group had a 67.7% increased risk of AD than non-frail group (HR = 1.677; 95%CI, 1.179-2.385; p = 0.004), a 61.8% increased risk of AD than pre-frail group (HR = 1.618; 95%CI, 1.131-2.316; p = 0.009) and a far higher risk of AD than robust group (HR = 2.011; 95%CI, 1.263-3.202; p = 0.003). Frailty was associated with cognitive decline (global cognition, memory and executive function), whole brain and hippocampus atrophy, and ventricle dilation. Higher frail degree predicted faster cognitive decline, brain atrophy and ventricle dilation. Frailty's association with cognition was partially mediated by volume of whole brain (29.54%-30.17% of total effect), hippocampus (18.21%-24.55% of total effect), and ventricle (baseline, 7.62%-10.87% of total effect; change rate, 13.30%-24.33% of total effect).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty as a potential risk factor for AD, further mechanisms investigation is warranted; mitigating frailty could potentially contribute to AD prevention.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

39685885,Cognitive Impairment in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: A Single-Center Prospective Cohort Study.,"Background/Objectives: Cognitive impairment represents a core and prodromal clinical feature of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We sought to assess specific cognitive domains which are mainly affected among patients with CAA and to investigate probable associations with neuroimaging markers and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Methods: Thirty-five patients fulfilling the Boston Criteria v1.5 or v2.0 for the diagnosis of probable/possible CAA were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CSF biomarker data were collected. Every eligible participant underwent a comprehensive neurocognitive assessment. Spearman's rank correlation tests were used to identify possible relationships between the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) sub-scores and other neurocognitive test scores and the CSF biomarker and neuroimaging parameters among CAA patients. Moreover, linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effects of CSF biomarkers on the ACE-R total score and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, based on the outcomes of univariate analyses. Results: Cognitive impairment was detected in 80% of patients, and 60% had a coexistent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology based on CSF biomarker profiles. Notable correlations were identified between increased levels of total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and diminished performance in terms of overall cognitive function, especially memory. In contrast, neuroimaging indicators, including lobar cerebral microbleeds and superficial siderosis, had no significant associations with cognitive scores. Among the CAA patients, those without AD had superior neurocognitive test performance, with significant differences observed in their ACE-R total scores and memory sub-scores. Conclusions: The significance of tauopathy in cognitive impairment associated with CAA may be greater than previously imagined, underscoring the necessity for additional exploration of the non-hemorrhagic facets of the disease and new neuroimaging markers.",J Clin Med,2024
40036706,"Clinical, radiological, pathological and prognostic features of general paresis: a cohort study.","General paresis is a rare type of syphilis characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and psychiatric syndromes. It is often misdiagnosed because of its rarity and similarity with other diseases. We aimed to comprehensively investigate the clinical, radiological, pathological, and prognostic features of general paresis, and compare it with other dementias. Between August 2019 and January 2024, patients were recruited from a Memory Clinic Setting of National Center for Neurological Disorders in China. Participants underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging, and were followed after treatment. Comparative analysis was conducted on clinical features and neuropsychiatric assessments, while brain image features were investigated using linear regression models and SuStaIn models. Seventy-eight patients were included, with 90% being male. The median duration from symptom onset to the first diagnostic visit was 15 months. Sixty-three patients were followed for an average of 1.4 years. Cognitive impairment emerged as the most common symptom, with half of the patients co-existed with motor symptoms. Impairment across all cognitive domains accompanied by positive psychiatric symptoms raised suspicion for general paresis, and distinguishing it from Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and anti-LGI1 encephalitis-related dementia. Common imaging abnormalities in general paresis included whole brain atrophy and cortical hypointensity. The hippocampal-predominant and hippocampal-sparing atrophy subtypes were identified. Autoimmune responses in general paresis were demonstrated through the detection of autoimmune encephalitis antibodies in 11% of patients. Pathological amyloid changes were observed in 26% of patients, while elevated total tau levels were found in 30%. Seventy percent of patients showed improvement following treatment, with a reduction in the number of symptoms observed across all cases. This study identifies specific clinical syndromes and radiological features of general paresis and refines the understanding of its prognosis. We provide clues to distinguish general paresis from other dementias, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. The role of novel pathological changes in general paresis needs to be further studied.",Brain,2025
39865685,Differences in brain volume in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition across different anatomical regions: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.,"BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a stage between cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease. Despite much published research on MCI, there continues to be a knowledge gap of volumetric brain changes in MCI versus cognitively normal (CN) in racially diverse, community-based samples.ObjectiveThe study aimed to understand differences in volume of selected brain regions in individuals with MCI versus those who are cognitively normal.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study with 1835 participants, which sampled all cognitively impaired participants (n = 667) and a subsample of cognitively normal participants from the ARIC neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS). All individuals underwent a brain MRI. Two models (5 versus 22 regions of interest [ROI]) were built to analyze differences in brain volume between cognitively normal and MCI, and among 3 cognitive domains (memory, language, executive function). Using previous visits data, we estimated the standard deviations of 20-year cognitive decline equivalent to the difference in brain volume between MCI and CN.ResultsEvery lobe was significantly smaller in individuals with MCI, with the largest difference observed in the temporal lobe. Moreover, there was a significant difference between MCI and CN in every subregion within the temporal lobe. The difference in volume between CN and MCI was equivalent to the total brain volume difference associated with a 1.24 standard deviation greater long-term cognitive decline.ConclusionsLoss of volume in all cortical lobes, but particularly in the temporal lobe, was associated with MCI. Additionally, significant volume differences were observed in the temporal lobe in all three cognitive domains.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40050677,Carbon ion stimulation therapy reverses iron deposits and microglia driven neuroinflammation and induces cognitive improvement in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Insoluble iron deposits often exist as iron oxide nanoparticles in protein aggregates, impaired ferritin, or activated microglia and have been implicated as major causes of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. However, no crucial evidence has been reported to support the therapeutic effects of current iron chelators on the deposition of various molecular forms of insoluble iron. We investigated the therapeutic effect of carbon ion stimulation (CIS) via a transmission beam on insoluble iron deposits, iron inclusion bodies, and the associated biological response in 5xFAD AD mouse brains. Compared with no treatment, CIS dose-dependently induced a 33-60% reduction in the amount of ferrous-containing iron species and associated inclusion bodies in the brains of AD mice. CIS induced considerable neuroinflammation downregulation and, conversely, anti-inflammatory upregulation, which was associated with improved memory and enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effective degradation of insoluble iron deposits in combination with pathogenic inclusion bodies promotes AD-modifying properties and offers a potential CIS treatment option for AD.",Sci Rep,2025
39956970,Uncovering nutrition needs in dyads of caregivers and persons with dementia.,"BackgroundNutrition risk is common in Alzheimer's disease and is associated with symptoms of dementia, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and mortality. Family caregivers who increasingly manage nutrition needs of persons with dementia (PWD) experience high caregiver burden, low health literacy, and nutrition risk. Few interventions for informal caregivers have included nutrition.ObjectiveTo inform design of a future caregiver nutrition intervention.MethodsThis cross-sectional study used a convergent mixed methods approach to 1) assess nutrition status among PWD and caregiver dyads (measures in common included Mini Nutrition Assessment, skin carotenoid, and handgrip strength), and 2) interview caregivers to identify needs and barriers for nutrition intervention. We hypothesized caregiver nutrition literacy is associated with PWD nutrition risk. Data collected in nutrition assessment and interviews were analyzed separately then side-by-side for comparison.ResultsOf 50 dyads, 48% had at least one individual exhibiting nutrition risk, and nutrition status categories (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 6.25, p = 0.012) between caregivers and PWD were related. Caregiver nutrition literacy was associated with 1) PWD factors including nutrition risk (rho = 0.244), body mass index (BMI) (rho = 0.421), handgrip strength (rho = 0.283), and skin carotenoid (rho = 0.351), and 2) Caregiver factors including nutrition risk (rho = 0.304), diet quality (rho = 0.304), and BMI (rho = 0.333). Interviews with 18 caregivers found caregivers prioritize PWD nutrition, provide more PWD nutrition care since diagnosis, experience social isolation, and would attend nutrition interventions if PWD are included.ConclusionsNutrition risk was more common among caregivers when PWD demonstrated nutrition risk. Factors present in individuals within the dyad were associated with partner nutrition risk. Future research should identify effective approaches for intervening on dyadic nutrition risk.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39968126,Reduction of orexin-expressing neurons and a unique sleep phenotype in the Tg-SwDI mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Sleep disturbances are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). We performed a sleep study on Tg-SwDI mice, a cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) model, and age-matched wild-type (WT) control mice. The results showed that at 12 months of age, the hemizygous Tg-SwDI mice spent significantly more time in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (44.6 ± 2.4% in Tg-SwDI versus 35.9 ± 2.5% in WT) and had a much shorter average length of wake bout during the dark (active) phase (148.5 ± 8.7 s in the Tg-SwDI versus 203.6 ± 13.0 s in WT). Histological analysis revealed stark decreases of orexin immunoreactive (orexin-IR) neuron number and soma size in these Tg-SwDI mice (cell number: 2187 ± 97.1 in Tg-SwDI versus 3318 ± 137.9 in WT. soma size: 109.1 ± 8.1 μm<sup>2</sup> in Tg-SwDI versus 160.4 ± 6.6 μm<sup>2</sup> in WT), while the number and size of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) immunoreactive (MCH-IR) neurons remained unchanged (cell number: 4256 ± 273.3 in Tg-SwDI versus 4494 ± 326.8 in WT. soma size: 220.1 ± 13.6 μm<sup>2</sup> in Tg-SwDI versus 202.0 ± 7.8 μm<sup>2</sup> in WT). The apoptotic cell death marker cleaved caspase-3 immunoreactive (Caspase-3-IR) percentage in orexin-IR neurons was significantly higher in Tg-SwDI mice than in WT controls. This selective loss of orexin-IR neurons could be associated with the abnormal sleep phenotype in these Tg-SwDI mice. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of the selective death of orexin-IR cells and relevant effects on cognition impairments in this mouse model of microvascular amyloidosis.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39871110,Validating the Accuracy of Parkinson's Disease Clinical Diagnosis: A UK Brain Bank Case-Control Study.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite diagnostic criteria refinements, Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical diagnosis still suffers from a not satisfying accuracy, with the post-mortem examination as the gold standard for diagnosis. Seminal clinicopathological series highlighted that a relevant number of patients alive-diagnosed with idiopathic PD have an alternative post-mortem diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PD comparing the in-vivo clinical diagnosis with the post-mortem diagnosis performed through the pathological examination in 2 groups.
METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, patients and healthy subjects who consented to the post-mortem pathological diagnosis at the UK Brain Bank were consecutively enrolled from the UK Brain Bank. Medical records were reviewed to classify participants and performance metrics were further calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard.
RESULTS: Four thousand five hundred seventy one subjects were eligible for the study. The clinical diagnosis group was: 1,048 Parkinson's patients and 1,242 healthy subjects. Pathology diagnosis group were: 996 Parkinson's patients and 1,288 subjects with no post-mortem abnormality. For the group of clinical diagnosis, PD diagnosis showed: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, accuracy of 90.96%, F1-Score 0.89, and a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.925 (SE ± 0.006) [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.913, 0.937], 𝑝<0.001. In this group, the most frequent pathology diagnosis among clinically misdiagnosed PD (false positive) patients was dementia with Lewy bodies (19.4%). Conversely, the most frequent clinical diagnosis among PD missed clinical diagnosis (false negative) patients was Alzheimer's disease (18.5%).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings confirm a still significant diagnostic error and emphasize the need for more fine and homogeneous criteria to classify idiopathic Parkinson's patients correctly. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol,2025
39834280,Modulation of mitochondrial functions contributes to the protection of lamotrigine against Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundOur previous studies have established that the broad-spectrum anti-epileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) confers protection against cognitive impairments, synapse and nerve cell damage, as well as characteristic neuropathologies in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for this protective effect induced by LTG remain largely elusive.ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of LTG against AD.MethodsFive-month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with 30 mg/kg of LTG daily for three consecutive months. Subsequently, high-throughput ribosome profiling sequencing was conducted to identify differentially translated genes (DTGs) rescued by LTG in the brains of these mice. To gain further insights into the potential functions and pathways of these LTG-rescued DTGs, gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were performed. RNA expression, protein levels, and translational efficiency were assessed to explore how LTG regulated gene expression processes in AD-related DTGs. Additionally, Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide-stimulated primary neurons were used to uncover the potential mechanisms and signaling pathway by which LTG mitigated oxidative stress under AD context.ResultsFor the first time, we reveal that LTG inactivates mitochondrial complexes in the brains of APP/PS1 mice by suppressing the translational efficiency of mitochondrial complexes-related genes. More importantly, we demonstrate that LTG mitigates mitochondrial-mediated oxidative stress in neurons within the context of AD by activation of SIRT6/PGC-1α pathway.ConclusionsThese findings provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of LTG against AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40071061,Opportunities to encourage adoption of a biomarker-enabled care pathway for Alzheimer's in primary care.,"UNLABELLED: Identification of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a challenge due to limited specialist availability, diagnostic access, disease awareness, and cultural factors. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) could play a critical role in the identification and referral of patients suspected of AD to specialty care. A multidisciplinary AD Biomarker Task Force was convened to evaluate current biomarker use cases, define an optimal biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway, and understand factors impacting adoption. The Task Force identified opportunities to support biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway adoption, including streamlining risk assessment and screening by leveraging digital tools, activating primary care providers through education, generating data to expand applicability to diverse populations, and advocating for aligned policies and quality measures. Adoption of BBBMs in the primary care setting will be critical to improve early AD detection. However, challenges to pathway adoption persist and will require action from clinicians, payers, policy makers, and patients to address.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood-based biomarkers can streamline the identification of AD in primary care.Future biomarker-enabled diagnostic care pathways will leverage digital assessments.Education, data generation, and policy advocacy are vital to encourage BBBM use.Implementation of AD care pathways requires the activation of diverse stakeholders.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39937857,CASP8 intronic expansion identified by poly-glycine-arginine pathology increases Alzheimer's disease risk.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 10% of the population ≥65 y of age, but the underlying biological risks of most AD cases are unclear. We show anti-poly-glycine-arginine (a-polyGR) positive aggregates frequently accumulate in sporadic AD autopsy brains (45/80 cases). We hypothesize that these aggregates are caused by one or more polyGR-encoding repeat expansion mutations. We developed a CRISPR/deactivated-Cas9 enrichment strategy to identify candidate GR-encoding repeat expansion mutations directly from genomic DNA isolated from a-polyGR(+) AD cases. Using this approach, we isolated an interrupted (GGGAGA)<sub>n</sub> intronic expansion within a SINE-VNTR-Alu element in CASP8 (CASP8-GGGAGA<sup>EXP</sup>). Immunostaining using a-polyGR and locus-specific C-terminal antibodies demonstrate that the CASP8-GGGAGA<sup>EXP</sup> expresses hybrid poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n proteins that accumulate in CASP8-GGGAGA<sup>EXP</sup>(+) AD brains. In cells, expression of CASP8-GGGAGA<sup>EXP</sup> minigenes leads to increased p-Tau (Ser202/Thr205) levels. Consistent with other types of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins, poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n protein levels are increased by stress. Additionally, levels of these stress-induced proteins are reduced by metformin. Association studies show specific aggregate promoting interrupted CASP8-GGGAGA<sup>EXP</sup> sequence variants found in ~3.6% of controls and 7.5% AD cases increase AD risk [CASP8-GGGAGA-AD-R1; OR 2.2, 95% CI (1.5185 to 3.1896), P = 3.1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>]. Cells transfected with a high-risk CASP8-GGGAGA-AD-R1 variant show increased toxicity and increased levels of poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n aggregates. Taken together, these data identify polyGR(+) aggregates as a frequent and unexpected type of brain pathology in AD and CASP8-GGGAGA-AD-R1 alleles as a relatively common AD risk factor. Taken together, these data support a model in which CASP8-GGGAGA<sup>EXP</sup> alleles combined with stress increase AD risk.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025

METHODS: We measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, amyloid beta (Aβ)1-40, Aβ1-42, and neurofilament light chain in research and real-world cohorts. Participants were categorized by brain amyloid status using US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved CSF or PET methods.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 demonstrated superior accuracy in detecting brain amyloid pathologies, with area under the curve from 0.94 to 0.97 in all cohorts. Specificity was lower in the real-world cohort but improved significantly by integrating demographic and clinical factors, aligning performance with research cohorts. Additionally, plasma biomarkers exhibited strong correlations with their CSF counterparts and PET standardized uptake value ratios, with significant associations in amyloid-positive participants.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 are effective diagnostic tools. However, patient demographics, apolipoprotein E ε4 status, and cognitive condition must be considered to improve specificity in the clinical practice.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and p-tau217/amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42 demonstrated exceptional accuracy (area under the curve: 0.94-0.97) in detecting brain amyloid pathologies across both research (Southern China Aging Brain Initiative [SCABI]-1, SCABI-2) and real-world clinical practice (RCP) cohorts. Incorporating patient-specific factors (sex, age, apolipoprotein E ε4, cognitive status) improved diagnostic specificity in the clinical RCP cohort, aligning its performance with that of research cohorts. Plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau217 and their ratios, showed robust correlations with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography amyloid standardized uptake value ratios, underscoring their value as non-invasive diagnostic alternatives. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 proved highly effective in diagnosing amyloid burden, offering a practical solution to bridge research advancements with real-world clinical practice.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39918606,Rebalancing Immune Interactions within the Brain-Spleen Axis Mitigates Neuroinflammation in an Aging Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β protein and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. Neuroinflammation, resulting from chronic activation of brain-resident innate immune cells as well as enhanced peripheral leukocyte access across the blood-brain barrier, crucially affects AD progression. In this context, TNFSF10, a cytokine substantially expressed in the AD brain, has been shown to modulate both the innate and the adaptive branches of the immune response in AD-related neuroinflammation. In this study, we explored whether a TNFSF10-neutralizing treatment could represent a tool to re-balance the overall overshooting inflammatory response in a mouse model of AD. Specifically, 3xTg-AD mice were treated sub-chronically with an anti-TNFSF10 monoclonal antibody for three months, and were then sacrificed at 15 months. TNFSF10 neutralization reduced the expression of the inflammatory marker CD86, inversely related to levels of the anti-inflammatory marker CD206 in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting a switch of microglia towards a neuroprotective phenotype. Similar results were observed in the splenic macrophage population. Moreover, flow cytometry revealed a significant decrease of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells as well as reduced number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>LY6C<sup>high</sup> proinflammatory monocytes in both the brain and the spleen of 3xTg-AD mice treated with anti-TNFSF10 monoclonal antibody. Finally, the treatment resulted in lower count of splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing PD1. The data suggest that TNFSF10 system-targeted treatment effectively restrain overshooting central and peripheral inflammation by rebalancing the overall immune response, mitigating the progression of AD pathology.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2025
39748845,Trends and determinants of choline alfoscerate use in newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients in Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Choline alfoscerate, a cholinergic precursor, is widely used in Korea for dementia-related symptoms and is covered by national health insurance (NHI). This study investigates the utilization trends and factors influencing choline alfoscerate prescription in newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using real-world data.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) for patients aged 60 years and older who were newly diagnosed with AD between 2012 and 2019. Patients with prescriptions for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) or memantine within 60 days of diagnosis were included. Choline alfoscerate utilization was defined as prescriptions within 60 days of initial diagnosis. Factors influencing its use were identified through multiple logistic regression analyses, and trends over time were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage Trend test.
RESULTS: Among the 330,326 study participants, 99,845 (33.08%) were prescribed choline alfoscerate, with usage increasing from 15.96% in 2012 to 47.65% in 2019. Factors positively associated with its use included male sex, MedAid insurance, and osteoarthritis. Conversely, usage decreased with comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, chronic kidney disease, and depression.
CONCLUSION: Choline alfoscerate usage in Korea has significantly increased, partly due to its national insurance coverage and the absence of disease-modifying therapies for AD. Given the uncertain efficacy and potential risks of choline alfoscerate, continuous monitoring and rigorous evaluation of its long-term benefits and safety are essential. Further research is necessary to establish definitive evidence for its effectiveness and guide its therapeutic use in AD management.
HIGHLIGHTS: Choline alfoscerate usage among newly diagnosed AD patients in Korea increased from 15.96% in 2012 to 47.65% in 2019.Male sex (OR = 1.05) and MedAid insurance coverage (OR = 1.07) were associated with higher odds of choline alfoscerate usage.Usage was more likely in patients with osteoarthritis (OR = 1.05) and less likely among those with hypertension (OR = 0.96), stroke/TIA (OR = 0.80), chronic kidney disease (OR = 0.80), and depression (OR = 0.93).Patients in rural areas had higher odds of using choline alfoscerate (OR = 1.28) compared to those in metropolitan areas (OR = 1.00).Despite limited evidence of efficacy, the extensive use of choline alfoscerate highlights the need for continuous monitoring and rigorous evaluation to ensure its safety and therapeutic value in AD management.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40116643,Local and distant atrophy mediate the relationship between tau pathology and cognition in temporoparietal region in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundTau pathology is closely associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline, but how it specifically influences local and distant gray matter volume (GMV) and cognitive function remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the spatial relationships between tau pathology, GMV and cognition using hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI).MethodsTwenty amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 14 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 22 Aβ-negative normal controls (NC) underwent standardized neuropsychological assessments and <sup>18</sup>F-fortaucipir PET/MRI scans. We investigated the associations between regional tau standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and GMV in AD signature regions. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the potential mediating effects of local and distant GMV in the relationship between tau pathology and cognition.ResultsThe study indicated that increased <sup>18</sup>F-fortaucipir SUVR and decreased GMV were related to cognitive performance in MCI and AD patients. Compared to NC group, the number of brain regions with local and distant correlations between GMV and SUVR was greater in AD/MCI group. Mediation analysis revealed that GMV served as a significant mediator between tau pathology and cognition in local regions. Furthermore, distant effects were also observed, with hippocampal atrophy partially mediated the relationship between entorhinal cortex tau pathology and cognition. Meanwhile, medial parietal lobe atrophy partially mediated the relationship between medial temporal lobe tau deposition and cognition.ConclusionsOur findings provide an anatomically detailed insight into relationships between tau, GMV and cognition, especially in entorhinal cortex-hippocampus, temporal-parietal lobe cortical circuits.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39922598,Advancing Alzheimer's disease risk prediction: development and validation of a machine learning-based preclinical screening model in a cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant challenge for individuals aged 65 and older, being the most prevalent form of dementia. Although existing AD risk prediction tools demonstrate high accuracy, their complexity and limited accessibility restrict practical application. This study aimed to develop a convenience, efficient prediction model for AD risk using machine learning techniques.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional study with participants aged 60 and older from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. We selected personal characteristics, clinical data and psychosocial factors as baseline predictors for AD (March 2015 to December 2021). The study utilised Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms alongside traditional logistic regression for modelling. An oversampling method was applied to balance the data set.
INTERVENTIONS: This study has no interventions.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 2379 participants, of whom 507 were diagnosed with AD.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. RESULTS: 11 variables were critical in the training phase, including educational level, depression, insomnia, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), medication count, gender, stenting, systolic blood pressure (sbp), neurosis and rapid eye movement. The XGBoost model exhibited superior performance compared with other models, achieving area under the curve of 0.915, sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 92.9%. The most influential predictors were educational level, total medication count, age, sbp and BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed classifier can help guide preclinical screening of AD in the elderly population.",BMJ Open,2025
39764106,Shared Genetic Architecture Between COVID-19 Severity and Alzheimer's Disease Across European and African Ancestries.,"The global outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been linked to long-term neurological complications, including an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among older adults. However, the precise genetic impact of COVID-19 on long-term AD development remains unclear. This study leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and genotype data to explore the genetic association between AD and various COVID-19 phenotypes across European ancestry (EA) and African ancestry (AA) cohorts, and the possibility of a causal effect of COVID-19 on AD. We first calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of three COVID-19 phenotypes in AD cases and controls from both EA and AA populations, then determined the genetic associations between COVID-19 PRSs and AD by logistic regression analyses with or without adjusting for age, sex, and APOE genotypes. Significant positive associations were found between AD diagnosis and COVID-19 PRSs in both populations, with the strongest associations identified in the AA population. However, Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of COVID-19 phenotypes on AD liability. We explored this finding further through the analysis of shared genomic regions between the COVID-19 phenotypes and AD and found a region of overlap on chromosome 17 that was highly pleiotropic for traits implicating immune function, psychiatric disorders, and lung function phenotypes. These findings suggest that while COVID-19 and AD share overlapping polygenic contributions involving peripheral genes across multiple traits, they lack a direct connection involving core genes that drive the development of their respective pathologies.",Res Sq,2024
39988890,Generation of an Inducible Destabilized-Domain Cre Mouse Line to Target Disease Associated Microglia.,"The function of microglia during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be investigated using mouse models that enable genetic manipulation of microglial subpopulations in a temporal manner. We developed mouse lines that express either Cre recombinase (Cre) for constitutive targeting, or destabilized-domain Cre recombinase (DD-Cre) for inducible targeting from the Cst7 locus (Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup>) to specifically manipulate disease associated microglia (DAM) and crossed with Ai14 tdTomato cre-reporter line mice. Cst7<sup>Cre</sup> was found to target all brain resident myeloid cells, due to transient developmental expression of Cst7, but no expression was found in the inducible Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup> mice. Further crossing of this line with 5xFAD mice combined with dietary administration of trimethoprim to induce DD-Cre activity produces long-term labeling in DAM without evidence of leakiness, with tdTomato-expression restricted to cells surrounding plaques. Using this model, we found that DAMs are a subset of plaque-associated microglia (PAMs) and their transition to DAM increases with age and disease stage. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that tdTomato+ cells show higher expression of disease and inflammatory genes compared to other microglial populations, including non-labeled PAMs. These models allow either complete cre-loxP targeting of all brain myeloid cells (Cst7<sup>Cre</sup>), or inducible targeting of DAMs, without leakiness (Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup>).",Glia,2025
40017668,Trends of the Dementia Burden in South Asia: An Analysis of 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze the trends in the burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias (ADoD) in South Asia from 1990 to 2021, focusing on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The objective is to identify key risk factors, such as metabolic and behavioral health risks, and assess regional variations in the burden of ADoD across five South Asian countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 report were analyzed using descriptive statistics and join point regression analysis. The analysis evaluated trends in ADoD incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs across five South Asian countries, focusing on health risk factors, including high body mass index, behavioral and metabolic risks.
RESULTS: A slight decrease in incidence rates from 80.57 to 79 per 100,000 was observed, alongside a significant increase in mortality rates from 14.11 to 17.2 per 100,000. While prevalence rates experienced a minor decline, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rose from 272.02 to 308.27 per 100,000, reflecting an increasing burden of the disease. Notably, Nepal significantly reduced its incidence rates, while Pakistan saw an increase in mortality rates. In South Asia, the highest-ranking risk factor is metabolic risks, followed by high fasting plasma glucose (FPG).
CONCLUSIONS: The growing burden of ADoD in South Asia necessitates targeted public health strategies addressing key risk factors, with metabolic health risks being a primary contributor. Public health interventions should focus on the most affected populations, particularly the elderly and females, to mitigate the increasing impact of dementia across the region.",Aging Med (Milton),2025
40133608,Longitudinal excitation-inhibition balance altered by sex and APOE-ε4.,"Neuronal hyperexcitation affects memory and neural processing across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive continuum. Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic, shows promise in improving cognitive impairment by restoring the neural excitation/inhibition balance in AD patients. We previously identified a hyper-excitable phenotype in cognitively unimpaired female APOE-ε4 carriers relative to male counterparts cross-sectionally. This sex difference lacks longitudinal validation; however, clarifying the vulnerability of female ε4-carriers could better inform antiepileptic treatment efficacy. Here, we investigated this sex-by-ε4 interaction using a longitudinal design. We used resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging collected longitudinally from 106 participants who were cognitively unimpaired for at least one scan event but may have been assessed to have clinical dementia ratings corresponding to early mild cognitive impairment over time. By including scan events where participants transitioned to mild cognitive impairment, we modeled the trajectory of the whole-brain excitation-inhibition ratio throughout the preclinical cognitively healthy continuum and extended to early impairment. A linear mixed model revealed a significant three-way interaction among sex, ε4-status, and time, with female ε4-carriers showing a significant hyper-excitable trajectory. These findings suggest a possible pathway for preventative therapy targeting preclinical hyperexcitation in female ε4-carriers.",Commun Biol,2025
39813317,Inhaled xenon modulates microglia and ameliorates disease in mouse models of amyloidosis and tauopathy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Antiamyloid antibody treatments modestly slow disease progression in mild dementia due to AD. Emerging evidence shows that homeostatic dysregulation of the brain immune system, especially that orchestrated by microglia, plays an important role in disease onset and progression. Thus, a major question is how to modulate the phenotype and function of microglia to treat AD. Xenon (Xe) gas is a noble gas used in human patients as an anesthetic and a neuroprotectant used for treating brain injuries. Xe penetrates the blood-brain barrier, which could make it an effective therapeutic. To assess the effect of Xe on microglia and AD pathology, we designed a custom Xe inhalation chamber and treated several mouse models of AD with Xe gas. Xe treatment induced mouse microglia to adopt an intermediate activation state that we have termed pre-neurodegenerative microglia (pre-MGnD). This microglial phenotypic transition was observed in mouse models of acute neurodegeneration and amyloidosis (APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice) and tauopathy (P301S mice). This microglial state enhanced amyloid plaque compaction and reduced dystrophic neurites in the APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mouse models. Moreover, Xe inhalation reduced brain atrophy and neuroinflammation and improved nest-building behavior in P301S mice. Mechanistically, Xe inhalation induced homeostatic brain microglia toward a pre-MGnD state through IFN-γ signaling that maintained the microglial phagocytic response in APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice while suppressing the microglial proinflammatory phenotype in P301S mice. These results support the translation of Xe inhalation as an approach for treating AD.",Sci Transl Med,2025
39971964,Activation dynamics study of trapped platelets using a lab-built optical tweezers micro-raman spectrometer.,"It is well documented that platelet disorders can result from various causes and can lead to different disease conditions such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia, Autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and even cancer, to name a few. The diagnosis of many of these diseases mainly depends on imaging examinations, clinical analysis and neuropsychological tests, these may be time taking procedures and, have a high chances of false positive/false negative results. The Raman tweezers spectroscopy can provide trust worthy results without much time delay. In the present study the activation dynamics of platelets were studied and observed that the activation leads to biochemical and morphological changes, such as the formation of filopodia on the platelet surface, transformation in the shape from discoid to spherical, and translocation of aminophospholipids from inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The Raman bands corresponding to phospholipids shows remarkable intensity variations during activation. The detailed knowledge regarding the activation dynamics of platelets will be important in monitoring CVDs, ADs, etc. and this paper illustrates a prospective method that can be incorporated into clinical settings in the near future to study and analyze platelet activation. This study will be the first to display the trapping of platelets in its live form to study their activation dynamics using an in-house assembled optical tweezers micro-Raman spectrometer.",Sci Rep,2025
39766491,Multilingual Prediction of Cognitive Impairment with Large Language Models and Speech Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment poses a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and intervention. Traditional diagnostics like neuroimaging and clinical evaluations are often subjective, costly, and inaccessible, especially in resource-poor settings. Previous research has focused on speech analysis primarily conducted using English data, leaving multilingual settings unexplored.
METHODS: In this study, we present our results from the INTERSPEECH 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, where we aimed to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict cognitive scores for English and Chinese speakers (169 in total). Our approach leverages Whisper, a speech foundation model, to extract language-agnostic speech embeddings. We then utilize ensemble models to incorporate task-specific information.
RESULTS: Our model achieved unweighted average recall of 81.83% in an MCI classification task, and root mean squared error of 1.196 in cognitive score prediction task, which placed the model at the second and the first position, respectively, in the ranking for each task. Comparison between language-agnostic and language-specific models reveals the importance of capturing language-specific nuances for accurate cognitive impairment prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of language-specific ensemble modeling with Whisper embeddings in enabling scalable, non-invasive cognitive health assessments of Alzheimer's disease, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual settings.",Brain Sci,2024
39793580,Multivariate proteome-wide association study to identify causal proteins for Alzheimer disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for the majority of individuals with dementia. Here, we aim to identify causal plasma proteins for AD, shedding light on the etiology of AD. We utilized the latest large-scale plasma proteomic data from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) and AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). Via a robust univariate instrumental variable (IV) regression method, we identified causal proteins through cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and (both cis- and trans-)pQTLs. To further reduce potential false positives due to high linkage disequilibrium (LD) of some pQTLs and high correlations among some proteins, we developed a robust multivariate IV regression method, called two-stage constrained maximum likelihood (MV-2ScML), to distinguish direct and confounding/mediating effects of proteins; some key features of the method include its robustness to invalid IVs and applicability to GWAS summary data. Our work highlights some differences between using cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs and critical values of multivariate analysis for fine-mapping causal proteins, providing insights into plasma protein pathways to AD.",Am J Hum Genet,2025

We aim to assess whether CP cysts (CPCs), defined using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relate to aging and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We used multi-sequence 7T MRI to observe CPCs, characterizing their presence and characteristics in healthy younger controls, healthy older controls (OCs), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and patients with uremic encephalopathy. CP volume (CPV) and CPC characteristics were compared across groups, and associations between CPV and CPC features were analyzed across all subjects.
RESULTS: The AD group showed a significantly higher presence and number of CPCs compared to other groups and also had a significantly larger CPV than healthy OCs. The number and size of CPCs were associated with CPV.
DISCUSSION: 7T MRI offers a distinct advantage in observing CPCs, and the high prevalence of CPCs in patients with AD warrants further investigation.
HIGHLIGHTS: 7T MRI enables visualization of the fine structures of the choroid plexus. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a higher number of choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) compared to healthy older adults and other patient groups. CPCs may serve as an auxiliary marker for AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

VGF peptide in CSF was analyzed using mass spectrometry.ResultsWe observed decreased CSF VGF in preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia individuals than amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals. Reduced CSF VGF was associated with cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, ventricle enlargement, and glucose hypometabolism at baseline, and it predicted a more marked deterioration over time.ConclusionsOur findings support the important contributions of VGF to disease pathogenesis and progression in the early stages of AD.

40009021,Astrocyte-Specific Phenotyping of FAD<sup>4T</sup> as an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory decline and behavioral changes. Its pathological features include senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive gliosis, comprising abnormal accumulations of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein surrounded by reactive astrocytes and microglia. Recently, it has emerged that severe reactive astrocytes and MAOB-dependent production of GABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are the real causes of learning and memory impairment and neurodegeneration. Diverse mouse models for AD have been developed to clarify pathological mechanisms and discover therapeutic strategies and drugs. However, there are many shortfalls and discrepancies among them. A new AD mouse model named FAD<sup>4T</sup> has been developed to overcome various shortcomings. Here, we employed astrocyte-focused screening procedures to examine the pathological features of FAD<sup>4T</sup> as an AD model. Our results revealed that the FAD<sup>4T</sup> mice showed abnormal accumulation of Aβ plaques in overall brain regions at 6 and 12 months. We found astrocytic hypertrophy with a significant elevation of GFAP and LCN2. However, the expressions of MAOB and iNOS, a severe reactive astrocyte marker, were unchanged. Electrophysiological and behavioral analysis indicated aberrant tonic GABA release, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired CA1-specific memory. These findings demonstrate that FAD<sup>4T</sup> mice mimic pathological and functional features of AD, different from other AD mouse models. These findings demonstrate that FAD<sup>4T</sup> mimics some features of AD patients but lacks other important features, such as severe reactive astrocytes and neurodegeneration. This astrocyte-focused screening method offers valuable tools for advancing AD research and developing new therapeutic strategies.",Glia,2025
40050115,Hippocampal neural stem cell exosomes promote brain resilience against the impact of tau oligomers.,"A promising therapeutic intervention for preventing the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is to protect and improve synaptic resilience, a well-established early vulnerability associated with the toxic effects of oligomers of Aβ (AβO) and Tau (TauO). We have previously reported that exosomes from hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) protect synapses against AβO. Here, we demonstrate how exosomes can also shield against TauO toxicity in adult mice synapses, potentially benefiting primary and secondary tauopathies. Exosomes from hippocampal NSCs (NSCexo) or mature neurons (MNexo) were delivered intracerebroventricularly to adult wildtype male mice (C57Bl6/J). After 24 hours, TauO were administered to suppress long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory, measured by electrophysiology and contextual memory deficits measured using novel object recognition (NOR) test. We also assessed TauO binding to synapses using isolated synaptosomes and cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, mimics of select miRNAs present in NSCexo, were delivered ICV to mice prior to assessment of TauO-induced suppression of hippocampal LTP. Our results showed that NSC-, not MN-, derived exosomes, prevented TauO-induced memory impairment, LTP suppression, and reduced Tau accumulation and TauO internalization in synaptosomes. These findings suggest that NSC-derived exosomes can protect against synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits induced by both AβO and TauO, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for multiple neurodegenerative states.Significance Statement NSCexo provide an unprecedented therapeutic strategy targeting an early vulnerability driven by amyloidogenic toxic oligomers associated with multiple neurodegenerative states.",J Neurosci,2025
39858593,Production of Amyloid-β in the Aβ-Protein-Precursor Proteolytic Pathway Is Discontinued or Severely Suppressed in Alzheimer's Disease-Affected Neurons: Contesting the 'Obvious'.,"A notion of the continuous production of amyloid-β (Aβ) via the proteolysis of Aβ-protein-precursor (AβPP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons constitutes both a cornerstone and an article of faith in the Alzheimer's research field. The present Perspective challenges this assumption. It analyses the relevant empirical data and reaches an unexpected conclusion, namely that in AD-afflicted neurons, the production of AβPP-derived Aβ is either discontinued or severely suppressed, a concept that, if proven, would fundamentally change our understanding of the disease. This suppression, effectively self-suppression, occurs in the context of the global inhibition of the cellular cap-dependent protein synthesis as a consequence of the neuronal integrated stress response (ISR) elicited by AβPP-derived intraneuronal Aβ (iAβ; hence self-suppression) upon reaching certain levels. Concurrently with the suppression of the AβPP proteolytic pathway, the neuronal ISR activates in human neurons, but not in mouse neurons, the powerful AD-driving pathway generating the C99 fragment of AβPP independently of AβPP. The present study describes molecular mechanisms potentially involved in these phenomena, propounds novel approaches to generate transgenic animal models of AD, advocates for the utilization of human neuronal cells-based models of the disease, makes verifiable predictions, suggests experiments designed to validate the proposed concept, and considers its potential research and therapeutic implications. Remarkably, it opens up the possibility that the conventional production of AβPP, BACE enzymes, and γ-secretase components is also suppressed under the neuronal ISR conditions in AD-affected neurons, resulting in the dyshomeostasis of AβPP. It follows that whereas conventional AD is triggered by AβPP-derived iAβ accumulated to the ISR-eliciting levels, the disease, in its both conventional and unconventional (triggered by the neuronal ISR-eliciting stressors distinct from iAβ) forms, is driven not (or not only) by iAβ produced in the AβPP-independent pathway, as we proposed previously, but mainly, possibly exclusively, by the C99 fragment generated independently of AβPP and not cleaved at the γ-site due to the neuronal ISR-caused deficiency of γ-secretase (apparently, the AD-driving ""substance X"" predicted in our previous study), a paradigm consistent with a dictum by George Perry that Aβ is ""central but not causative"" in AD. The proposed therapeutic strategies would not only deplete the driver of the disease and abrogate the AβPP-independent production of C99 but also reverse the neuronal ISR and ameliorate the AβPP dyshomeostasis, a potentially significant contributor to AD pathology.",Genes (Basel),2025
39778459,Tau association with synaptic mitochondria coincides with energetic dysfunction and excitatory synapse loss in the P301S tauopathy mouse model.,"Neurodegenerative Tauopathies are a part of several neurological disorders and aging-related diseases including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The major hallmarks present in these conditions include Tau pathology (composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles) and synaptic loss. in vivo studies linking Tau pathology and mitochondrial alterations at the synapse, an avenue that could lead to synaptic loss, remain predominantly scarce. For this reason, using 3-month-old wild-type and human mutant Tau P301S transgenic mice, we investigated the association of Tau with mitochondria, synaptosome bioenergetics, and characterized excitatory synaptic loss across hippocampal regions (Dentate Gyrus, perisomatic CA3, and perisomatic CA1) and in the parietal cortex. We found a significant loss of excitatory synapses in the parietal cortex and hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG) of Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, we found that Tau (total and disease-relevant phosphorylated Tau) associates with both the non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria of Tau P301S mice and this coincided with synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction. The findings presented here suggest that Tau associates with mitochondria at the synapse, leading to synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction, and likely contributing to synaptic loss.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39905569,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation on cognitive function in older adults with cognitive impairments: the influence of dosage parameters.,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive function in the older people. This study further explores the impact of tDCS and its dosage parameters on cognitive enhancement in older people with cognitive impairments.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through November 2023 were retrieved from databases including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Library. Participants were older adults with cognitive impairments, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. AD was diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), or the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer' Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. Dementia was diagnosed using the DSM-V or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, while MCI was diagnosed using the DSM-V, the Petersen criteria, or assessments such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Standardized mean difference (SMD) values were analyzed to assess the effects.
RESULTS: A total of 19 RCTs were included. tDCS significantly improved the Mini-Mental State Examination score both immediately post-intervention (SMD = 0.51, p = 0.005) and at follow-up (SMD = 2.29, p = 0.0003). Significant effects were observed when tDCS was used alone (SMD = 0.39, p = 0.04), at current densities ≤ 0.06 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (SMD = 0.25, p = 0.04), session durations exceeding 20 min (SMD = 0.89, p = 0.01), up to 15 sessions (SMD = 0.28, p = 0.009), and when an active electrode was placed over the temporal area (SMD = 0.33, p = 0.02). People with AD showed greater improvements compared to those with MCI or dementia (SMD = 0.91, p = 0.02). However, tDCS did not significantly improve memory or executive function.
CONCLUSION: tDCS demonstrated efficacy in enhancing global cognition in older people with cognitive impairments, providing insight into optimal parameters for clinical application. However, no improvement were observed in memory or executive function.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and PET imaging were used to assess amyloid-β (A) and Tau (T) tangles load, classifying participants into AT profiles based on the results. The association of BW and SUA with AT profiles was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, and their relationship with cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores) were analyzed using multivariable linear regression.ResultsLower BW levels significantly influenced the presence of Aβ positive state (A+) (p = 0.007), while SUA levels did not (p = 0.263). Higher dementia proportion (p = 0.021), lighter BW (p = 0.019), and lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) levels (p = 0.025) were associated with AD pathological progress (A-T-→A+T-→A+T+), but SUA was not observed statistically significant. Among all participants regardless of Aβ state, high education levels (p < 0.001), high BW (p = 0.010), and high SUA (p=0.036) were associated with high MMSE scores, and high serum creatinine (p = 0.003) was associated with low MMSE scores.ConclusionsLower BW may accelerate AD pathology and cause cognitive impairment, while SUA is not linked to AD pathological progression but protects cognitive function.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39994963,"Dance-like state detection, curiosity, and decentering: A pilot study on artful movement and mindfulness.","BACKGROUND: Curiosity and decentering are two constructs that represent momentary mindfulness. Dance is an art and complex physical activity mode, which may serve as a behavioral correlate of mindfulness.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize momentary mindfulness in relation to a novel, accelerometer-derived measure for characterizing human movement quality (i.e. ""dance-like state"" DLS scores).
METHODS: Adults (N = 41), ages 18-83 years old, engaged in the following conditions in a lab and completed questionnaires on mindfulness after each: (1) clipping their fingernails; (2) sitting, standing, and walking on a treadmill; and (3) dancing at self-determined reference intensities with and without music. Conditions 2-3 were monitored with accelerometers. DLS score summary statistics (i.e. median and median amplitude deviation [MAD]) were used in linear mixed effects models.
RESULTS: On average, curiosity [13.7(1.02)] was significantly associated with median DLS scores (β = 1.79, p = 0.007) over time; adults with a lower median DLS score reported higher levels of curiosity [16.2; 95%C.I. 13.3-19.0], on average, when compared [12.6; 95%C.I., 10.3-14.9] to adults with a higher median DLS score. On average, decentering [14.9(1.01)] was significantly associated with the DLS score MAD (β = 1.28, p = 0.035) over time; adults who had less variability in DLS scores across conditions reported greater experiences of decentering [15.9; 95%C.I. 13.7-18.1], on average, when compared [13.3; 95%C.I. 10.7-15.9] to adults with more variability in DLS scores across conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Among ostensibly healthy adults, movement quality was correlated with momentary mindfulness. Additional research is needed to understand if DLS scores are differentially associated with momentary mindfulness among adults with Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40149843,Murine Non-Transgenic Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology: Focus on Risk Factors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant challenge among neurodegenerative disorders, as effective treatments and therapies remain largely undeveloped. Despite extensive research efforts employing various methodologies and diverse genetic models focused on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, the research for effective therapeutic strategies remains inconclusive. The key pathological features of AD include Aβ senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and the activation of neuroinflammatory pathways. Presently, investigations into AD and assessing potential treatments predominantly utilize Aβ transgenic models. Conversely, non-transgenic models may provide valuable insights into the multifaceted pathological states associated with AD. Thus, these models may serve as practical complementary tools for evaluating therapeutic and intervention strategies, since the primary AD risk factors are most frequently modeled. This review aims to critically assess the existing literature on AD non-transgenic models induced by streptozotocin, scopolamine, aging, mechanical stress, metals, and dietary patterns to enhance their application in AD research.",Brain Sci,2025
39949872,Assessing the clinical meaningfulness of slowing CDR-SB progression with disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: For many patients and caregivers, a major goal of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is to extend independence in instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADLs and BADLs). The goal of this study was to estimate the effect of treatments on the time remaining independent in IADLs and BADLs.
METHODS: Participants at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) who met eligibility criteria for recent DMT trials were studied: age ≥60 years at baseline, clinical diagnosis of very mild or mild AD dementia (global Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score 0.5 or 1), biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology, and at least one follow-up CDR assessment within 5 years. For IADLs, a subset of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) was examined that rated the degree of independence in the following: paying bills, driving, remembering medications and appointments, and preparing meals. For BADLs, the Personal Care domain of the CDR was used. Mixed-effects logistic and ordinal regression models were used to examine the relationship between CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and the individual functional outcomes and their components. The change in CDR-SB over time was estimated with linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: A total of 282 participants were followed for an average of 2.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.3 years). For 50% of individuals, loss of independence in IADLs occurred at CDR-SB >4.5 and in BADLs at CDR-SB >11.5. For individuals with a baseline CDR-SB = 2, treatment with lecanemab would extend independence in IADLs for 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4-18 months) and treatment with donanemab in the low/medium tau group would extend independence in IADLs by 13 months (95% CI 6-24 months).
DISCUSSION: Independence in ADLs can be related to CDR-SB and used to demonstrate the effect of AD treatments in extending the time of independent function, a meaningful outcome for patients and their families.
HIGHLIGHTS: We estimated time to loss of independence for people with AD dementiaEstimating time to loss of independence can help with clinical decision-makingDisease-modifying treatments for AD dementia can extend independence.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39741706,Unraveling Alzheimer's disease: insights from single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomic.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline, primarily affecting memory and executive function. This review highlights recent advancements in single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, which provide detailed insights into the cellular heterogeneity and neuroimmune mechanisms of AD. The review addresses the need for understanding complex cellular interactions to identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Single-cell sequencing has revolutionized our understanding by mapping gene expression at the individual cell level, revealing distinct microglial and astrocytic states that contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These technologies have uncovered disease-associated microglial subpopulations and gene expression changes linked to AD risk genes, essential for developing targeted therapies. In conclusion, the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with other omics data is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of AD, paving the way for personalized medicine. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration will be vital in translating these findings into effective treatments, improving patient outcomes.",Front Neurol,2024
40193773,The Lecanemab Clarity AD Open-Label Extension in Early Alzheimer's Disease (P1-3.003).,"OBJECTIVE: To report the initial findings up to 36 months from the ongoing Clarity AD open-label extension (OLE) study.
BACKGROUND: In the 18-month, phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab, an amyloid-beta (Aβ) antibody, demonstrated amyloid reduction and slowing cognition and function decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). An OLE of Clarity AD is evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of lecanemab.
DESIGN/METHODS: Clarity AD is an 18-month, randomized study (core) followed by and open-label OLE in phase individuals with early AD. Clinical (CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog14, and ADCS-MCI-ADL) and biomarker (PET, Aβ42/40 ratio, and ptau181) outcomes were evaluated overall as well as by examining 'delayed start' (core:placebo followed by OLE:lecanemab) and 'early start' (core:lecanemab followed by OLE:lecanemab) cohorts. Analyses by core baseline tau PET levels were conducted from the tau PET sub-study.
RESULTS: Overall, 1385 participants enrolled in the OLE. Across clinical endpoints, lecanemab-treated participants continued to benefit through 24 months. Separation between early and delayed start was maintained between 18 and 36 months (p<0.05), with a similar disease trajectory when all participants received lecanemab. Biomarker changes continued to improve and were seen in as early as 3 months in newly-treated lecanemab participants. Across assessments, consistent rates of clinical stability or improvements were observed regardless of baseline tau levels, with the highest rates of improvements observed for the low tau group at 36 months (no decline:59%; improvement:51%). No new safety signals were observed ARIA rates are low (similar to ARIA rates on placebo) after 6 months. A time to worsening CDR-SB analysis demonstrated that ARIA is not associated with accelerated long-term progression.
CONCLUSIONS: In Clarity AD, maintenance of treatment difference with ongoing lecanemab treatment through 36 months versus newly treated lecanemab participants is consistent with a disease-modifying effect. Delayed start and lower pathology group results support early initiation of lecanemab treatment.

39822292,"Exploring the relationship between melanopsin gene variants, sleep, and markers of brain health.","INTRODUCTION: Melanopsin is a photopigment with roles in mediating sleep and circadian-related processes, which are often disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Melanopsin also impacts cognition and synaptogenesis. This study investigated the associations between melanopsin genetic variants, sleep, and markers of brain health.
METHODS: Linear regression analyses examined the relationship of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the melanopsin gene (OPN4), with cortical amyloid beta (Aβ), cognition, brain volumes, and self-reported sleep traits in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Further analyses assessed whether sleep traits x OPN4 SNP interactions were associated with markers of brain health.
RESULTS: OPN4 SNPs rs2355009 and rs3740334 were associated with attention and processing speed and ventricular volume and language, respectively. Furthermore, rs3740334 and rs1079610 showed significant interactions with sleep traits in association with language.
DISCUSSION: This study shows associations of OPN4 genetic variants with markers of brain health, and suggests that these variants interact with sleep to exacerbate cognitive effects.
HIGHLIGHTS: The relationships between melanopsin gene (OPN4) variants and markers of brain health were examined cross-sectionally in cognitively unimpaired older individuals.Variation within OPN4is associated with differences in cognition and ventricular volume.rs2355009 and rs3740334 show small-moderate associations with differences in attention and processing speed. Further to this, rs2355009 and rs3740334 were associated with ventricular volumes and language performance, respectively.The interactions between rs3740334 and rs1079610 and sleep traits also showed small-moderate associations with differences in language performance.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40185902,Brain overlapping system-level architecture influenced by external magnetic stimulation and internal gene expression in AD-spectrum patients.,"The brain overlapping system-level architecture is associated with functional information integration in the multiple roles of the same region, and it has been developed as an underlying novel biomarker of brain disease and may characterise the indicators for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains uncertain whether these changes are influenced by external magnetic stimulation and internal gene expression. A total of 73 AD-spectrum patients (52 with true stimulation and 21 with sham stimulation) were underwent four-week neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Shannon-entropy diversity coefficient analysis was used to explore the brain overlapping system of the neuroimaging data in these pre- and posttreatment patients. Transcription-neuroimaging association analysis was further performed via gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Compared with the rTMS_sham stimulation group, the rTMS_true stimulation group achieved the goal of cognitive improvement through the reconstruction of functional information integration in the multiple roles of 27 regions associated with the brain overlapping system, involving the attentional network, sensorimotor network, default mode network and limbic network. Furthermore, these overlapping regions were closely linked to gene expression on cellular homeostasis and immune inflammation, and support vector regression analysis revealed that the baseline diversity coefficients of the attentional and sensorimotor networks can effectively predict memory improvement after rTMS treatment. These findings highlight the brain overlapping system associated with cognitive improvement, and provide the first evidence that external magnetic stimulation and internal gene expression could influence these overlapping regions in AD-spectrum patients.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40063856,Association of Plasma Biomarkers With Longitudinal Atrophy and Microvascular Burden on MRI Across Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD), neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are increasingly being used in clinical trials for diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. However, their association with longitudinal structural brain MRI changes, an important outcome measure across neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases, is less known. We investigated how baseline plasma biomarkers reflect MRI markers of progression over time in patients with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.
METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included patients from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI), Parkinson disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders (FTD), or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), followed annually for 2 years. Recruitment took place at specialized university-based dementia, movement disorders, and/or stroke clinics in the province of ON, Canada. MRI outcomes included markers of cerebral atrophy (ventricular CSF and regional gray matter volumes) and of small vessel disease pathology (white matter hyperintensity [WMH], perivascular spaces, and lacunar volumes). Hemorrhagic markers at baseline were also included. Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated tau181 and tau217 (p-tau181, p-tau217), and β-amyloid (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>) were quantified from blood samples collected at baseline using Simoa and used as predictors in linear mixed models adjusted for time (months), age, sex, apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 carrier status, kidney function, vascular risk factors, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) diplotypes, waist-hip circumference ratio, and disease duration.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,240 MRIs from 473 patients (age: 69.2 ± 7.4 [range: 49-87]; 32.8% women). Elevated baseline levels of GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, and p-tau217, and to a lesser extent decreased levels of Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, were significantly associated with more cerebral atrophy and WMH burden at baseline (|B| = 0.02 to 1.69, p = 0.044 to &lt;0.001) and with progression over time (|B| = 0.001 to 0.028, p = 0.049 to &lt;0.001) in the pooled disease-agnostic group. Within disease-specific cohorts, GFAP and NfL were associated with cerebral atrophy and/or small vessel disease copathology in AD/MCI, PD, FTD, or CVD. P-tau181 and p-tau217 were associated with cerebral atrophy and/or small vessel disease copathology in AD/MCI, CVD, PD-MCI, or PD-dementia.
DISCUSSION: Selected plasma biomarkers seem useful as prognosis and monitoring tools of longitudinal imaging changes within real-world populations of neurodegenerative and/or cerebrovascular diseases, and provide insight into overlap across diseases in shared pathologic burden.",Neurology,2025
39894446,CRISPR-based epigenetic editing of Gad1 improves synaptic inhibition and cognitive behavior in a Tauopathy mouse model.,"GABAergic signaling in the brain plays a key role in regulating synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and cognitive processes. Large-scale sequencing has revealed the diminished expression of GABA-related genes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, it is largely unclear about the epigenetic mechanisms that dysregulate the transcription of these genes in AD. We confirmed that GABA synthesizing enzymes, GAD1 and GAD2, were significantly downregulated in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of AD human postmortem tissues. A tauopathy mouse model also had the significantly reduced expression of GABA-related genes, as well as the diminished GABAergic synaptic transmission in PFC pyramidal neurons. To elevate endogenous Gad1 levels, we used the CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome editing technology to recruit histone acetyltransferase p300 to Gad1. Cells transfected with a fusion protein consisting of the nuclease-null dCas9 protein and the catalytic core of p300 (dCas9<sup>p300</sup>), as well as a guide RNA targeting Gad1 promoter (gRNA<sup>Gad1</sup>), had significantly increased Gad1 mRNA expression and histone acetylation at Gad1 promoter. Furthermore, the tauopathy mouse model with PFC injection of dCas9<sup>p300</sup> and gRNA<sup>Gad1</sup> lentiviruses had significantly elevated GABAergic synaptic currents and improved spatial memory. These results have provided an epigenetic editing-based gene-targeting strategy to restore synaptic inhibition and cognitive function in AD and related disorders.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
40055261,SP3-Mediated Transcriptional Activation of GRIK1 is Involved in Alzheimer's Disease-Induced Cognitive Decline by Inducing Inflammasome Activation in Microglia.,"GRIK1 has been identified to suppress the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The present study investigated the damaging effect of GRIK1 on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, by focusing on inflammasome. APP-PS1 mice were subjected to a Y-maze test and a Morris water maze test. APP-PS1 mice with GRIK1 knockdown were constructed using adeno-associated virus, and the effects of GRIK1 knockdown on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia of brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice were analyzed. Mouse primary microglia BV2 was induced by LPS, and Western blot, flow cytometry, and ELISA were performed. GRIK1 was significantly elevated in the brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice. GRIK1 knockdown inhibited the neuronal damage and NLRP3 neuroinflammation in the brain tissues and improved cognitive dysfunction of APP-PS1 mice. Knockdown of GRIK1 inhibited activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in BV2 cells. SP3 was upregulated in the brain tissues of APP-PS1 mice, and SP3 promoted GRIK1 transcription by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of GRIK1 reversed the mitigating effect of knockdown of SP3 on cognitive dysfunction and NLRP3 activation in APP-PS1 mice. Overall, our results revealed that SP3-induced GRIK1 transcription potentiates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia, leading to cognitive dysfunction in AD.",Neuromolecular Med,2025
39742481,Deep learning predicts DNA methylation regulatory variants in specific brain cell types and enhances fine mapping for brain disorders.,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is essential for brain development and function and potentially mediates the effects of genetic risk variants underlying brain disorders. We present INTERACT, a transformer-based deep learning model to predict regulatory variants affecting DNAm levels in specific brain cell types, leveraging existing single-nucleus DNAm data from the human brain. We show that INTERACT accurately predicts cell type-specific DNAm profiles, achieving an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 across cell types. Furthermore, INTERACT predicts cell type-specific DNAm regulatory variants, which reflect cellular context and enrich the heritability of brain-related traits in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that incorporating predicted variant effects and DNAm levels of CpG sites enhances the fine mapping for three brain disorders-schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease-and facilitates mapping causal genes to particular cell types. Our study highlights the power of deep learning in identifying cell type-specific regulatory variants, which will enhance our understanding of the genetics of complex traits.",Sci Adv,2025
39757300,A comprehensive investigation of Clerodendrum Infortunatum Linn. using LC-QTOF-MS/MS metabolomics as a promising anti-alzheimer candidate.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a global health challenge, demanding innovative approaches for effective treatments. Clerodendrum infortunatum Linn. (Lamiaceae) is a shrub traditionally used as a medicinal plant to treat inflammation, skin diseases, and bronchitis. This study aims to identify the main bioactive metabolites in C. infortunatum using LC-QTOF-MS/MS and investigate its potential in protecting against cognitive decline in rats with scopolamine-induced AD disease. Metabolite profiling was performed on the methanol extract of the plant's aerial parts using LC-QTOF-MS/MS. The inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme was measured in vitro. To evaluate the cognitive effects, the methanol extract was orally administered at three doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) to scopolamine-induced AD rats, and their cognitive functions were assessed using the novel object recognition test. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity, as well as the levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, glutathione, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and amyloid-β in the rat hippocampus, were measured using ELISA, followed by histopathological evaluation. A total of 79 metabolites, spanning various chemical classes, such as organic acids, phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids and phenylethanoids, flavonoids, coumarins, other phenolics, and fatty acids and their derivatives, were identified. The results showed that the extract promoted enhanced cognitive functions in the novel object recognition test. Scopolamine administration significantly altered the acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and biomarker levels in the rat's hippocampus. However, treatment with C. infortunatum at 200 and 400 mg/kg almost restored these neurotransmitter levels to normal, which was further confirmed by histopathological analysis. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of C. infortunatum in mitigating cognitive decline in AD, with its first metabolite profiling revealing a range of bioactive compounds. The extract improved cognitive function in scopolamine-induced AD rats, restored acetylcholinesterase activity, normalized neurotransmitter levels, and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings suggest that C. infortunatum is a promising candidate for the development of natural therapies targeting AD.",Sci Rep,2025
39968681,Association of late-life variability in hemoglobin A1C with postmortem neuropathologies.,"INTRODUCTION: To study the relationship of late-life hemoglobin A1C (A1C) with postmortem neuropathology in older adults with and without diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: A total of 990 participants from five cohort studies of aging and dementia with at least two annually-collected A1C measures, who had autopsy. Neuropathologic evaluations documented cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other pathologies. To evaluate the association of A1C mean and variability (standard deviation [SD]) with neuropathology, we used a series of adjusted regression models.
RESULTS: Participants (mean age at death = 90.8 years; education = 15.8 years; 76% women) had six A1C measurements on average. Mean A1C was associated with greater odds of macroinfarcts (estimate = 0.14; p = 0.04) and subcortical infarcts (estimate = 0.16; p = 0.02). A1C variability was not associated with cerebrovascular pathology. A1C mean and variability were inversely associated with AD pathology.
DISCUSSION: The A1C average over time was associated with infarcts, and the A1C average and variability were inversely associated with AD pathology. Future studies should explore the underlying mechanisms linking A1C to dementia-related neuropathologies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Hemoglobin A1C (A1C), a measure of peripheral insulin resistance, is used to assess glycemic control. Higher A1C mean was associated with greater odds of macroscopic subcortical infarcts. A1C variability was not associated with cerebrovascular pathology. Both A1C mean and variability had inverse associations with AD pathology. None of the associations varied by diabetes mellitus status.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39850631,Clinical characteristics and biomarker profile in early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: the Shanghai Memory Study.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease constitutes ∼5-10% of Alzheimer's disease. Its clinical characteristics and biomarker profiles are not well documented. To compare the characteristics covering clinical, neuropsychological and biomarker profiles between patients with early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, we enrolled 203 patients (late-onset Alzheimer's disease = 99; early-onset Alzheimer's disease = 104) from a Chinese hospital-based cohort, the Shanghai Memory Study. A full panel of plasma biomarkers under the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration framework including plasma amyloid beta 40, amyloid beta 42, total-tau, neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau 181 were assayed using ultra-sensitive Simoa technology. Seventy-five patients underwent an amyloid molecular positron emission tomography scan whereas 43 received comprehensive amyloid, Tau deposition and hypometabolism analysis. Clinical features, plasma and imaging biomarkers were compared cross-sectionally. Compared to those with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease presented more severe impairment in language function, lower frequency of APOE ɛ4 and lower levels of plasma neurofilament light chain (all P &lt; 0.05). The plasma phosphorylated tau 181 concentration and phosphorylated tau 181/amyloid beta 42 ratios were higher in early-onset Alzheimer's disease than in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (all P &lt; 0.05). More severe Tau deposition as indicated by <sup>18</sup>F-florzolotau binding in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus was observed in the early-onset Alzheimer's disease group. Plasma phosphorylated tau 181 was associated with earlier age at onset and domain-specific cognitive impairment, especially in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. We concluded that patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease differed from late-onset Alzheimer's disease in cognitive performance and biomarker profile. A higher burden of pathological tau was observed in early-onset Alzheimer's disease and was associated with earlier age at onset and more profound cognitive impairment.",Brain Commun,2025
39685733,"FACEmemory<sup>®</sup>, an Innovative Self-Administered Online Memory Assessment Tool.","Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are currently underdiagnosed in the community, and early detection of cognitive deficits is crucial for timely intervention. FACEmemory<sup>®</sup>, the first completely self-administered online memory test with voice recognition, has been launched as an accessible tool to detect such deficits. This study aims to investigate the neuropsychological associations between FACEmemory subscores and cognitive composites derived from traditional paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tests and to develop an optimal algorithm using FACEmemory data and demographics to discriminate cognitively healthy (CH) individuals from those with MCI. Methods: A total of 669 participants (266 CH, 206 non-amnestic MCI [naMCI], and 197 amnestic MCI [aMCI]) were included. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted using a cognitive composite as the dependent variable and FACEmemory subscores and demographic data (age, sex, and schooling) as independent variables. Machine learning models were compared to identify an optimal algorithm for distinguishing between CH and MCI (whole MCI, aMCI, and naMCI). Results: Multiple regression analyses showed associations between FACEmemory scores and the domains of memory (ρ = 0.67), executive functions (ρ = 0.63), visuospatial/visuoperceptual abilities (ρ = 0.55), language (ρ = 0.43), praxis (ρ = 0.52), and attention (ρ = 0.31). An optimal algorithm distinguished between CH and aMCI, achieving a FACEmemory cutoff score of 44.5, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.81 and 0.72, respectively. Conclusions: FACEmemory is a promising online tool for identifying early cognitive impairment, particularly aMCI. It may contribute to addressing the underdiagnosis of MCI and dementia in the community and in promoting preventive strategies.",J Clin Med,2024
39767797,Evaluating the Efficacy of Levetiracetam on Non-Cognitive Symptoms and Pathology in a Tau Mouse Model.,"Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by amyloid-β plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), leading to cognitive decline and debilitating non-cognitive symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate compounds from four different classes in a short-term (7-day) study using transgenic tau mice to assess their ability to reduce non-cognitive symptoms. The best candidate was then evaluated for longer exposure to assess non-cognitive symptoms, cognition, and pathology. Methods: Tg4510 mice, expressing mutated human tau (P301L), were administered with levetiracetam, methylphenidate, diazepam, and quetiapine for 7 days at 6 months old, when pathology and cognitive deficits are established. Drugs were given in the diet, and non-cognitive symptoms were evaluated using metabolic cages. Levetiracetam was chosen for longer exposure (3 months) in 3-month-old Tg4510 mice and non-transgenic controls to assess behavior and pathology. Results: After 3 months of diet, levetiracetam mildly reduced tau pathology in the hippocampus but did not improve cognition in Tg4510 mice. Interestingly, it influenced appetite, body weight, anxiety-like behavior, and contextual fear memory in non-transgenic animals but not in Tg4510 mice. Conclusions: While levetiracetam has shown benefits in amyloid deposition models, it had limited effects on tau pathology and behavior in an animal model of tau deposition, which is crucial for AD context. The differential effects on non-transgenic versus Tg4510 mice warrant further investigation.",Biomedicines,2024

We included all studies reported MCI or dementia as outcomes and included women who experienced an APO, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, or placental abruption, during a pregnancy lasting ≥ 20 weeks. We excluded studies focused on men, nulliparous women, women with pre-pregnancy conditions associated with abnormal cognition, or those examining cognitive impairment within six months of pregnancy. The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023453511).
RESULTS: Of the 11,251 references identified, 15 studies including 7,347,202 participants met inclusion criteria. Only one study reported MCI as an outcome, while 11 studies (6,263,431 participants) examining dementia had sufficient data for meta-analysis. A history of any APO was associated with higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17, 1.49, I<sup>2</sup>= 80.4%), Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04, 1.53, I<sup>2</sup>=62.8%), and vascular dementia (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.70, 2.21, I<sup>2</sup>=0%). A history of any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was significantly associated with all-cause dementia (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11, 1.57) and vascular dementia (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.46, 2.17), but not Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98, 1.57).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest, most comprehensive meta-analysis to date, women with a history of any APOs had a significantly increased risk of future dementia with a moderately increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and nearly double the risk of vascular dementia.

39689527,Procognitive and neurotrophic benefits of α5-GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulation in a β-amyloid deposition mouse model of Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Reduced somatostatin (SST) and SST-expressing GABAergic neurons are well-replicated findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with cognitive deficits. SST cells inhibit pyramidal cell dendrites through α5-GABA-A receptors (α5-GABAA-R). α5-GABAAR positive allosteric modulation (α5-PAM) has procognitive and neurotrophic effects in stress and aging models. We tested whether α5-PAM (GL-II-73) could prevent cognitive deficits and neuronal spine loss in early stages, and reverse them in late stages of β-amyloid deposition in the 5xFAD model (N = 48/study; 50 % female). Acute administration of GL-II-73 prevented spatial working memory deficits in 5xFAD mice at 2 months of age, while chronic administration reversed the deficits at 5 months of age. Chronic GL-II-73 treatment prevented 5xFAD-induced loss of spine density, spine count and dendritic length at both time points, despite β-amyloid accumulation. These results demonstrate procognitive and neurotrophic effects of GL-II-73 in early and late stages of Alzheimer-related β-amyloid deposition. This suggests α5-PAM as a novel β-amyloid-independent symptomatic therapeutic approach.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39994995,"The associations between attentional control, episodic memory, and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration.","BACKGROUND: While episodic memory decline is the most common cognitive symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD), changes in attentional control have also been found to be sensitive to early AD pathology. The relations between longitudinal trajectories of these specific cognitive domains, especially attentional control, and biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration have not been thoroughly examined.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether baseline tau positron emission tomography (PET) and cortical thickness, relatively later markers within the AD cascade, predicted cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in episodic memory and attentional control.
METHODS: Cognitively normal individuals ([Clinical Dementia Rating CDR<sup>®</sup>] = 0; n = 249) at baseline completed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tau PET, and multiple assessments of episodic memory and attentional control. Generalized additive mixed-effects models examined whether tau PET summary measure and cortical thickness signature predicted cross-sectional and longitudinal trajectories of attentional control and episodic memory.
RESULTS: Higher tau PET and lower MRI cortical thickness were generally associated with worse cross-sectional cognitive performance. Our exploratory analyses found cortex-wide associations between tau PET and episodic memory, with limited suggestions of region-specific associations with attentional control. On longitudinal follow-up, higher tau PET was associated with a greater decline in episodic memory.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that tau PET is particularly sensitive to detecting longitudinal changes in episodic memory. This further informs relevant endpoints for clinical drug trials in cognitively normal individuals. Future studies might consider longer follow-ups and lag associations between changes in AD biomarkers and changes in cognition.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39702548,Response to Schmidt et al.: Lower activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and the risk of dementia: a Mendelian randomization analysis.,"A recent paper concluded that cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition may be a viable target to treat dementia, based on human genetic evidence of a protective effect of target inhibition on risk of Lewy body and Parkinson's dementia. Alzheimer's disease, which is by far the most prevalent cause of dementia (around 80% of all dementia cases) was not included as an outcome. Evidence shows CETP inhibition is unlikely to affect Alzheimer's risk and may even potentially modestly increase risk. There is also little evidence to support an effect of CETP inhibition on all-cause or vascular dementia. Thus, CETP inhibition is unlikely to be a viable target to treat the most prevalent causes of dementia.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024

Natural language processing (NLP) offers the potential for non-invasive diagnostics, social burden assessment, and research advancements in AD.
METHOD: A systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines explored NLP applications in AD, focusing on dataset types, sources, research foci, methods, and effectiveness. Searches were conducted across six databases (ACM, Embase, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) from January 2020 to July 2024.
RESULTS: Of 1740 records, 79 studies were selected. Frequently used datasets included speech and electronic health records (EHR), along with social media and scientific publications. Machine learning and neural networks were primarily applied to speech, EHR, and social media data, while rule-based methods were used to analyze literature datasets.
DISCUSSION: NLP has proven effective in various aspects of AD research, including diagnosis, monitoring, social burden assessment, biomarker analysis, and research. However, there are opportunities for improvement in dataset diversity, model interpretability, multilingual capabilities, and addressing ethical concerns.
HIGHLIGHTS: This review systematically analyzed 79 studies from six major databases, focusing on the advancements and applications of natural language processing (NLP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research.The study highlights the need for models focusing on remote monitoring of AD patients using speech analysis, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods such as brain imaging and aiding clinicians in both prediagnosis and post-diagnosis periods.The use of pretrained multilingual models is recommended to improve AD detection across different languages by leveraging diverse speech features and utilizing publicly available datasets.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40091552,The associations of cerebrospinal fluid ApoE and C1q with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"BackgroundThe roles of complement 1q (C1q) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in driving Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression might be explained by their associations with neuroinflammation and AD pathology which were previously reported.ObjectiveWe examined the associations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) C1q and ApoE with CSF neuroinflammatory biomarkers and AD core biomarkers, as well as explored whether C1q mediated the associations of CSF ApoE with these biomarkers.MethodsHere, we analyzed CSF proteomics data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using two different ADNI proteomics datasets-SomaScan (n = 579)and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM[n = 207]). Linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the association of CSF ApoE and C1q. The mediation model and structural equation model (SEM) were conducted to explore the associations of ApoE and C1q with AD biomarkers.ResultsMultiple linear regression showed that CSF ApoE was positively associated with CSF C1q in total participants and Alzheimer's continuum participants. Mediation analyses indicated that C1q mediated the associations of CSF ApoE with CSF T-tau, P-tau, sTREM2 and GFAP (mediation proportions range from 15.06 to 44.64%; all the p values < 0.05) but not with CSF amyloid-β and progranulin (PGRN). The SEM yielded similar results.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that C1q is linked to ApoE, and it mediates the associations of ApoE with T-tau, P-tau, sTREM2, GFAP, indicating C1q association with ApoE might be involved in AD progression.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40189519,The pharmacodynamics-based prophylactic benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors on neurodegenerative diseases: evidence from a network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represent a new generation of antihyperglycemic agents that operate through mechanisms distinct from conventional diabetes treatments. Beyond their metabolic effects, these medications have demonstrated neuroprotective properties in preclinical studies. While clinical trials have explored their therapeutic potential in established neurodegenerative conditions, their role in disease prevention remains unclear. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to comprehensively evaluate the prophylactic benefits of these agents across multiple neurodegenerative diseases and identify the most promising preventive strategies.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov through October 24th, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors. Our primary outcome was the incidence of seven major neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease. Secondary outcomes included safety profiles assessed through dropout rates. We performed a frequentist-based NMA and evaluated risk of bias with Risk of Bias tool. The main result of the primary outcome in the current study would be re-affirmed via sensitivity test with Bayesian-based NMA.
RESULTS: Our analysis encompassed 22 RCTs involving 138,282 participants (mean age 64.8 years, 36.4% female). Among all investigated medications, only dapagliflozin demonstrated significant prophylactic benefits, specifically in preventing Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 0.28, 95% confidence intervals = 0.09 to 0.93) compared to controls. Neither GLP-1 receptor agonists nor other SGLT2 inhibitors showed significant preventive effects for any of the investigated neurodegenerative conditions. Drop-out rates were comparable across all treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive NMA reveals a novel and specific prophylactic effect of dapagliflozin against Parkinson's disease, representing a potential breakthrough in preventive neurology. The specificity of dapagliflozin's protective effect to Parkinson's disease might rely on its highly selective inhibition to SGLT2. These findings provide important direction for future research and could inform preventive strategies for populations at risk of Parkinson's disease.

40078377,The prognosis of mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge gaps remain about the prognosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Conversion rates to dementia vary widely, and reversion to normal cognition has gained attention. This review updates evidence on MCI conversion risk and probability of stability and reversion.
METHODS: We searched databases for studies on MCI prognosis with ≥3 years of follow-up, established criteria for MCI and dementia, and performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to assess conversion risk, reversion, and stability probability. Meta-regressions identified sources of heterogeneity and guided subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: From 89 studies (mean follow-up: 5.2 years), conversion risk was 41.5% (38.3%-44.7%) in clinical and 27.0% (22.0%-32.0%) in population-based studies, with Alzheimer's dementia as the most common outcome. Stability rates were 49.3% (clinical) and 49.8% (population). Reversion was 8.7% (clinical) and 28.2% (population).
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight higher conversion in clinical settings and 30% reversion in population studies, calling for sustainable care pathway development.
HIGHLIGHTS: Prognosis for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) varies by setting; dementia risk is higher and the probability of reversion is lower in clinical-based studies.In both clinical and population settings, cognitive stability is ≈50%.A reorganization of health services could ensure sustainable care for individuals with MCI.Significant heterogeneity in MCI studies impacts data interpretation; follow-up length is crucial.Long-term prognosis studies on MCI in low- and middle-income countries are urgently needed.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40151396,Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases in regulatory decision-making by the European Medicines Agency.,"INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers (BMs) are valuable tools to facilitate early diagnosis of (subtypes of) diseases, improve patient selection and stratification, and detect therapeutic effects or safety concerns. This study explores the extent to which BMs are utilized in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), as well as topics of discussion regarding BMs in regulatory advice- and decision-making processes and sharing of BM-related data.
METHODS: The European Medicines Agency's marketing authorization application (MAA), qualification (QA/QO), and scientific advice (SA) procedures regarding NDDs were screened, and those that mention BMs were analyzed. Data were extracted on the intended disease, BM type, and context of use proposed by applicants. BMs were categorized based on both nature and function.
RESULTS: In total, 105 procedures that discussed BMs were analyzed, 57 SAs (January 2020 to December 2022), 19 QAs/QOs (January 2008 to December 2023), and 29 MAAs (January 1995 to December 2023). The majority involved Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 30), Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 9), and multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 33). Imaging BMs were the most common type of BMs discussed, and most BMs were used as pharmacodynamic/response measures. The acceptance and role of BMs differed between AD, PD, MS, and other NDDs. In regulatory procedures for AD, for example, diagnostic BMs guiding patient selection were commonly discussed, whereas in MAAs for MS, imaging BMs (particularly lesions) were generally accepted as supportive/secondary endpoints.
DISCUSSION: Despite the established role of certain BMs, mainly imaging BMs for MS, there remains a major need for more precise and reliable BMs to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring for NDDs. To implement novel BMs and facilitate development of new treatments and to eventually improve clinical practice, robust evidence bases showcasing biological plausibility or clear clinical benefits are essential. Collaboration and data-sharing among stakeholders is vital in generating this evidence and enhancing the understanding and management of NDDs.
HIGHLIGHTS: The European Medicines Agency's marketing authorization applications and qualification and scientific advice procedures.One hundred five procedures were analyzed regarding neurodegenerative diseases that discuss biomarkers.We found that acceptance and role of biomarkers differ per disease.Biological plausibility/clinical benefits are essential for biomarker implementation.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39747866,Immunoassay detection of multiphosphorylated tau proteoforms as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Different forms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have shown strong potential as Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We hypothesized that p-tau proteoforms simultaneously phosphorylated at two different sites may have an increased diagnostic value compared with tau phosphorylated at a single site. Here, we developed two immunoassays detecting CSF and plasma tau simultaneously phosphorylated at both T181 and T231 (p-tau181&231) and at T217 and T231 (p-tau217&231). Subsequently, we measured CSF and plasma p-tau181&231, p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 levels in two cohorts across the AD continuum and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients (discovery n = 55, validation n = 118). CSF and plasma p-tau217&231, p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231 and CSF, but not plasma, p-tau181&231 were significantly elevated in all AD continuum groups vs. Neurological Disease Control group. Notably, plasma p-tau217&231 consistently showed an improved diagnostic performance compared with single-site phosphorylation assays - p-tau217 or p-tau231. The differences observed between CSF and plasma measurements suggest matrix-specific protein processing, underscoring the need for further research on the dynamics of tau phosphorylation pattern along the AD continuum.",Nat Commun,2025

40193776,"Severe, Treatment-Resistant Psychiatric Syndrome as the Initial Presentation of Lewy Body Disorder (P9-3.018).","OBJECTIVE: N/A.
BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a progressive disease linked to the buildup of alpha-synuclein in the brain. The International DLB Consortium suggested three early presentations of the disease: Mild cognitive impairment, Delirium, and Psychiatric onset. However, these were not widely accepted in the scientific community due to insufficient evidence. There is a need to better understand the psychiatric-onset early stage of DLB.
DESIGN/METHODS: Case Report.
RESULTS: A 63-year-old male presented with new-onset severe generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. Multiple trials of antidepressant and antianxiety medications, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and ketamine infusions did not yield positive results. He became unable to work or function normally and was admitted to the hospital after a suicidal attempt in the setting of a paranoid delusion. Over six months, he developed mild word-finding difficulty, worsening ruminations about not sleeping, and orthostatic hypotension. The neurological exam was normal. MRI of the brain with and without contrast was unremarkable. A thorough serum laboratory panel and CSF laboratory tests all yielded normal results. Additionally, CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were within the normal range, and the NfL level was normal. One year after the onset of his psychiatric syndrome, he began experiencing occasional mild positional tremors in his left arm, along with mild stiffness. DatScan revealed reduced activity in the bilateral lentiform nuclei. Syn-One Test skin biopsy showed the presence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the posterior cervical and distal leg biopsy sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric-onset dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) typically begins after the age of 50 and is more prevalent in females. Paratonia, psychomotor retardation, and drug-induced parkinsonism often mimic the symptoms of DLB, leading to potential misdiagnosis. When new psychiatric symptoms emerge after the age of 50, especially if they do not respond to conventional therapies, the possibility of emerging Lewy body disease should be considered.

39935382,Astrocytic Hevin/SPARCL-1 Regulates Cognitive Decline in Pathological and Normal Brain Aging.,"Dementia, characterized by loss of cognitive abilities in the elderly, poses a significant global health challenge. This study explores the role of astrocytes, one of most representative glial cells in the brain, in mitigating cognitive decline. Specifically, we investigated the impact of Hevin (also known as SPARC-like1/SPARCL-1), a secreted glycoprotein, on cognitive decline in both normal and pathological brain aging. By using adeno-associated viruses, we overexpressed Hevin in hippocampal astrocytes of middle-aged APP/PSEN mice, an established Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. Results demonstrated that Hevin overexpression attenuates cognitive decline, as evidenced by cognitive tests, increased pre- and postsynaptic markers colocalization, and altered expression of synaptic mediators, as revealed by proteomic profiling. Importantly, Hevin overexpression did not influence the deposition of Aβ plaques in the hippocampus, a hallmark of AD pathology. Furthermore, the study extended its findings to middle-aged wild-type animals, revealing improved cognitive performance following astrocytic Hevin overexpression. In conclusion, our results propose astrocytic Hevin as a potential therapeutic target for age-associated cognitive decline.",Aging Cell,2025
40133765,Generalizability of tau and amyloid plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease cohorts of diverse genetic ancestries.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated threonine 181 of tau (pTau181) and amyloid beta (Aβ) are biomarkers for differential diagnosis and preclinical detection of Alzheimer disease (AD). Given differences in AD risk across diverse populations, the generalizability of existing biomarker data is not assured.
METHODS: In 2086 individuals of diverse genetic ancestries (African American, Caribbean Hispanic, and Peruvian), we measured plasma pTau181 and Aβ42/Aβ40. Differences in biomarkers between cohorts and clinical diagnosis groups and the potential discriminative performance of the two biomarkers were assessed.
RESULTS: pTau181 and Aβ42/Aβ40 were consistent across cohorts. Higher levels of pTau181 were associated with AD, while Aβ42/Aβ40 had minimal differences. Correspondingly, pTau181 had a greater predictive value than Aβ42/Aβ40; however, the area under the curve differed between cohorts.
DISCUSSION: pTau181 as a plasma biomarker for clinical AD is generalizable across genetic ancestries, but its predictive value may vary. Combining genomic and biomarker data from diverse individuals will increase understanding of genetic risk and refine clinical diagnoses.
HIGHLIGHTS: This is a diverse ancestry study of plasma biomarkers for AD. Plasma biomarkers were assessed in African Americans, Caribbean Hispanics, and Peruvians. Biomarker levels were consistent across the diverse cohorts. Plasma phosphorylated tau was higher in AD in all cohorts. Plasma biomarker findings in diverse cohorts largely generalize with existing European studies.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39767585,Does Bisphenol A (BPA) Exposure Cause Human Diseases?,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention-deficit disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease (PD), polycystic ovary disease (PCOS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have all been linked to exposure to bisphenol A (BPA).
METHODS: This paper is a review and discussion of the published literature.
RESULTS: Animal studies have shown BPA to be a broad-spectrum endocrine disruptor. BPA is metabolized via the glucuronidation pathway, which involves the addition of glucose to the target molecule, and is catalyzed by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Evidence of compromised glucuronidation has been found for ASD, DHD, PD, and PCOS. Genetic polymorphisms that alter the catalytic activity of the UGTs and efflux transporters involved are common. There are two ways to interpret the findings of associations between BPA glucuronidation efficiency and disease, a 'direct' pathway and an 'indirect' pathway. With the 'direct' pathway, free BPA is the actual causative agent. Compromised BPA detoxification leads to higher concentrations of free BPA in vulnerable tissues. Decreased BPA detoxification leads to increased exposure of vulnerable tissues to free BPA, where it can function as an endocrine disruptor. With the 'indirect' pathway, BPA is not the causative agent. BPA serves as a marker for the decreased glucuronidation efficiency of another unknown compound of endogenous origin detoxified by a similar combination of UGTs and efflux transporters as BPA. It is this compound(s), acting as an endocrine disruptor, that leads to a metabolic environment that favors disease development over an extended time period.
CONCLUSION: A review of the existing literature supports the indirect 'marker' hypothesis over the 'direct' hypothesis.",Biomedicines,2024

BACKGROUND: AD is a devastating neurological disease with complex genetic etiology, yet most known loci were only identified from the late-onset type of European ancestry.
DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AD totaling 6,878 Chinese and 487,511 European individuals.
RESULTS: We demonstrated a shared genetic architecture between early- and late-onset AD. In addition to the APOE locus, our GWAS of two independent Chinese samples uncovered three novel AD susceptibility loci (KIAA2013, SLC52A3, and TCN2) and a novel ancestry-specific variant within EGFR (rs1815157). Notably, the TCN2 locus showed genome-wide significant associations with AD in both discovery and replication stages in Chinese populations. More replicated variants were observed in the Chinese (31%) than European samples (4%). Combining genome-wide associations and functional annotations, EGFR and TCN2 were prioritized as two of the most biologically significant genes. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization suggests that high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration might be protective against AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study reveals novel AD susceptibility loci, emphasizes the importance of diverse populations in AD genetic research, and advances our understanding of disease etiology.

METHODS: We included 3224 participants with information on CVH at early midlife (mean age 45.0 ± standard deviation 3.4) an cognitive assessments, and neuroimaging 5, 10, and 15 years later including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), total gray matter (GM), and hippocampal volume. CVH was operationalized according to the American Heart Association's (AHA) ""Life's Essential 8"" (LE8) guidelines. The association between LE8 and cognitive and neuroimaging measures was examined using mixed linear regression adjusting for age, sex, race, and education.
RESULTS: Worse LE8 score was associated with steeper decline in cognition, higher accumulation of WMHs, and steeper decline in total GM and hippocampal volume.
DISCUSSION: Poor CVH is related to accelerated brain aging across midlife, highlighting the need to screen for and improve CVH earlier to prevent adverse cognitive outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Poor cardiovascular health in early midlife is associated with faster decline in cognition across 10 years overall and in specific domains. Poor and intermediate cardiovascular health was associated with higher accumulation of white matter hyperintensities across midlife. Poor cardiovascular health was associated with faster atrophy in total gray matter volume and hippocampal volume.",Alzheimers Dement,2024

As an antioxidant iron chelator, its mechanisms are multimodal, involving the binding of brain iron and the consequent engagement of several pathways to counter pathogenesis across multiple diseases. We and other research groups have shown that IN DFO rescues cognitive impairment in several rodent models of Alzheimer Disease (AD).
METHODS: This study was designed to probe dosing regimens to inform future clinical trials, while exploring mechanisms within the intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) model.
RESULTS: Five weeks of daily IN dosing of Long Evans rats with 15 μL of a 1% (0.3 mg), but not 0.1% (0.03 mg), solution of DFO rescued cognitive impairment caused by ICV STZ administration as assessed with the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test of spatial memory and learning. Furthermore, IN DFO modulated several aspects of the neuroinflammatory milieu of the ICV STZ model, which was assessed through a novel panel of brain cytokines and immunohistochemistry. Using RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis, STZ was shown to induce several pathways of cell death and neuroinflammation, and IN DFO engaged multiple transcriptomic pathways involved in hippocampal neuronal survival.

Despite the promising results observed in animal models of AD, the neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects of Dendropanax morbiferus (DM) still need to be evaluated in individuals with cognitive decline.ObjectiveThis 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of DM leaf extracts on cognitive function in 85 individuals with SCD (KCT0006329, registered on July 7, 2021).MethodsParticipants were randomly assigned to either the DM (n = 43) or the placebo (n = 42) group. Cognitive functions, including attention and memory, were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed at the beginning and end of the study to evaluate cortical thickness. Changes in cognition and cortical thickness and their associations were evaluated.ResultsThe results demonstrated significant improvements in attention (p = 0.014), memory (p = 0.037), and global cognitive function (p = 0.001) in the DM group compared to the placebo group, accompanied by increased cortical thickness in the left lingual gyrus/cuneus (corrected p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, in the DM group, increased cortical thickness in this region was correlated with both memory (r = 0.422, p = 0.016) and global cognitive functions (r = 0.471, p = 0.007). DM was well-tolerated, with no adverse events reported.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that DM may possess cognitive-enhancing properties for individuals with SCD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40192212,Scaling Alzheimer's Care: The Case for Specialized Treatment Clinics.,"BACKGROUND: The approval of amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibodies has transformed Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, shifting the field from symptomatic management to targeting the underlying pathology. These therapies require specialized care models to manage the selection, treatment, and monitoring of eligible patients.
METHODS: Here, we describe the implementation of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment Clinic (KU-AATC) at the University of Kansas Health System, a dedicated clinic model designed to streamline access to amyloid-clearing therapies and to provide safe, efficient patient care. We detail the KU-AATC's structured approach, including a multidisciplinary team with advanced practice providers (APPs), leading patient evaluation and shared decision-making, and tailored workflows to ensure timely access to treatment. We review data from the clinic's first 18 months.
RESULTS: The KU-AATC model demonstrates a feasible approach to managing the complex needs of amyloid-targeting therapy for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a specialized clinic structure can support safe, accessible, and efficient care for AD patients, potentially serving as a scalable model for healthcare systems adapting to the demands of emerging AD treatments. Expanding similar clinics may address neurologist shortages and improve equitable access to advanced therapies.",J Am Geriatr Soc,2025
40095520,Changes in transcriptional regulation in the temporal lobe in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with intricate pathophysiological mechanisms. Transcriptome analysis has been used to investigate the pathogenesis of AD from the perspectives of mRNA expression, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation. However, these 3 transcriptomic regulatory layers have not been comprehensively explored, limiting our understanding of the transcriptomic landscapes of AD pathogenesis.ObjectiveWe aimed to describe the transcriptomic landscapes of AD pathogenesis, detect the contributions of different regulatory layers to the total transcriptional variance, and identify diagnostic candidates for AD prediction.MethodsWe collected RNA sequencing data derived from the temporal lobes of 257 patients with AD and 97 controls, performed joint transcriptional analysis with multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA2) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and evaluated the signals with regression models.ResultsWe found that increasing Braak stage is associated with progressive downregulation of SYT1, CHN1, SNAP25, VSNL1, and ENC1 as well as upregulation of TNS1, SGK1, CPM, PPFIBP, and CLMN. Subsequent MOFA2 revealed that alternative splicing contributes most (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.558) to the transcriptional variance between patients with AD and controls followed by alternative polyadenylation (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.449) and mRNA expression (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.438). In addition, the regression model constructed with SNAP25, VSNL1, and ENC1 expression could distinguish between patients with AD and controls (AUC = 0.752).ConclusionsWe systematically detailed the transcriptional landscapes in patients with AD and report mRNA signals associated with AD, offering novel insights into AD pathogenesis and therapeutic development.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

We used random-effects models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was evaluated using the Egger's test, while potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated through meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses.ResultsOur analysis included 21 studies with a total of 411,810 participants. MetS was associated with increased risks of all-cause dementia (RR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03-1.71, I² = 85.8%) and vascular dementia (RR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.32-3.24, I² = 10.1%), but not Alzheimer's disease (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.64-1.91, I² = 81.8%). Regarding cognitive impairment, longitudinal studies showed an increased risk (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.24-1.53, I² = 3.3%), with similar findings in cross-sectional studies (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.19-2.28, I² = 85.3%).ConclusionsThis study found that MetS is significantly associated with increased risks of dementia and cognitive impairment, with each component potentially being a modifiable factor.

40008917,"Posterior cingulate cortex microRNA dysregulation differentiates cognitive resilience, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: MicroRNA (miRNA) activity is increasingly appreciated as a key regulator of pathophysiologic pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of miRNAs during the progression of AD, including resilience and prodromal syndromes such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), remains underexplored.
METHODS: We performed miRNA-sequencing on samples of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) obtained post mortem from Rush Religious Orders Study participants diagnosed ante mortem with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, or AD. NCI subjects were subdivided as low pathology (Braak stage I/II) or high pathology (Braak stage III/IV), suggestive of resilience. Bioinformatics approaches included differential expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) target prediction, interactome modeling, functional enrichment, and AD risk modeling.
RESULTS: We identified specific miRNA groups, mRNA targets, and signaling pathways distinguishing AD, MCI, resilience, ante mortem neuropsychological test performance, post mortem neuropathological burden, and AD risk.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of harnessing miRNA activity to manipulate disease-modifying pathways in AD, with implications for precision medicine.
HIGHLIGHTS: MicroRNA (MiRNA) dysregulation is a well-established feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Novel miRNAs also distinguish subjects with mild cognitive impairment and putative resilience. MiRNAs correlate with cognitive performance and neuropathological burden. Select miRNAs are associated with AD risk with age as a significant covariate.

39855656,Ecopsychosocial strategies for the self-exploration of professional family caregivers to manage the behavioural and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer patients in Iran: a qualitative study.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to explore the experiences and viewpoints of professional family caregivers in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) to identify the ecopsychosocial strategies applied by them.
DESIGN: Qualitative study.
SETTING: Kerman, Iran.
PARTICIPANTS: Stories were collected from 40 professional family caregivers of dementia patients.
MEASUREMENT: The guidelines of the National Consensus Project (NCP) of the USA served as the conceptual framework for the deductive thematic analysis of our qualitative data. A schematic of the entire process was performed in five steps.
RESULTS: 30 stories relevant to the aim of this study were included in the analysis from April to June 2021. A majority of the stories were written by female caregivers. We identified 19 ecopsychosocial interventions, which covered the NCP dimensions except 'Care of the patient nearing the end of life'. More than half of these interventions were classified into psychological/psychiatric and physical aspects of care (57.8%). In addition to the care/support provided by special care units or home care, some caregivers believe that support from the government, various care organisations, social media and even other family members/friends is necessary to better manage BPSDs.
CONCLUSION: Despite limitations, such as having a small sample size and analysing only one story from each caregiver, our results indicate that dementia caregivers need more educational and cultural support in their ecopsychosocial strategies. Government involvement would yield more positive outcomes in managing BPSDs.",BMJ Open,2025
39713861,Microglia internalize tau monomers and fibrils using distinct receptors but similar mechanisms.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies are characterized by intracellular aggregates of microtubule-associated protein tau that are actively released and promote proteopathic spread. Microglia engulf pathological proteins, but how they endocytose tau is unknown.
METHODS: We measured endocytosis of different tau species by microglia after pharmacological modulation of macropinocytosis or clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or antagonism/genetic depletion of known tau receptors heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1).
RESULTS: Dynamin inhibition decreased microglial endocytosis of all tested tau species. Meanwhile, HSPG antagonism blocked only fibril uptake, and LRP1 antagonism or genetic depletion inconsistently inhibited the endocytosis of fibrils and monomers. Cre recombinase robustly enhanced tau uptake with partial selectivity for fibrils.
DISCUSSION: These data show that microglia take up both tau monomers and aggregates via a dynamin-dependent form of endocytosis (eg, CME) but may differ in using HSPGs for entry depending on species.
HIGHLIGHTS: Microglial endocytosis of tau monomers and fibrils is dynamin-dependent. HSPG antagonism blocks microglial uptake of tau fibrils but not monomers. LRP1 antagonism or knockdown inconsistently inhibits tau uptake. TAT-Cre stimulates semi-selective uptake of fibrils over monomers.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40138382,Naturido alleviates amyloid β1-42-induced adverse effects in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily associated with aging. While the amyloid hypothesis is not the only explanation for AD pathogenesis, it is widely recognized that the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) protein triggers pathological changes in the brains of patients. In a previous study, we showed that Naturido, a cyclic peptide derived from the medicinal fungus (Isaria japonica) grown on domestic silkworms (Bombyx mori), could reverse several age-related deficits in senescence-accelerated mice. In this study, we explored the potential of Naturido to reduce Aβ-related toxicity in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of AD, where human Aβ1-42 protein is overexpressed in neurons. Our results demonstrated that Naturido administration alleviated various phenotypes, including Aβ-induced impairment in associative learning, serotonin hypersensitivity, and locomotion in the transgenic C. elegans. These findings suggest the potential of Naturido as a candidate molecule for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.",PLoS One,2025
39913635,"The impact of apolipoprotein E, type ∊4 allele on Alzheimer's disease pathological biomarkers: a comprehensive post-mortem pilot-analysis.","The apolipoprotein E type ∊4 allele (ApoE4) is known as the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Meanwhile, many aspects of its impact on AD pathology remain underexplored. This study conducts a systematic data analysisof donor data from the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas. Our investigation delves into the intricate interplay between identified biomarkers and their correlation with ApoE4 across all severities of AD. Employing Pearson R correlation, and one-way and two-way ANOVA tests, we elucidate the pathological changes in biomarkers and the altering effects of ApoE4. Remarkably, the phosphorylation of tau observed in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) marked by the AT8 antibody, emerges as the most correlated factor with other pathological biomarkers. This correlation is mediated by both tau and amyloid pathology, suggesting a higher hierarchical role in determining AD pathological effects than other biomarkers. However, non-ApoE4 carriers exhibit a more significant correlation with disease progression severity compared to ApoE4 carriers, though ApoE4 carriers demonstrate significance in exacerbating the effect of accumulating phosphorylated tau and amyloid plaques assessed by AT8 and 6E10 antibodies. Furthermore, our analysis does not observe dramatic neuronal changes in grey matter across the span of AD pathology. Glia activation, measured by Iba1 and GFAP, demonstrates an amyloid-specific correlation. This research marks the first human post-mortem analysis providing a comprehensive examination of prevailing AD biomarkers and their interconnectedness with pathology and ApoE4 genetic factor. Limitations in the study are acknowledged, underscoring the need for further exploration and refinement in future research endeavors.",PLoS One,2025
40149738,Downregulation of Parahippocampal Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Proper regulation of copper is essential for maintaining neuronal stability and is facilitated by several chaperone proteins, protecting cells from oxidative damage that would otherwise be caused by improperly regulated copper ions. Oxidative stress, resulting from such dysregulation, is hypothesized to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the concentrations of the copper chaperones CCS, DCTN4, and ATOX1 in control and AD cases via Western blotting and ELISA, and quantified the copper concentrations in fractionated neurons using ICP-MS.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal a significant reduction in CCS levels in AD cases (p = 0.0085), with a progressive decline observed with advancing age. This decline was more pronounced in women, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0768). No significant differences were observed in copper concentrations within synaptosomal (p = 0.3869) or cytosolic fractions (p = 0.4461) between the AD and control cases. Additionally, comprehensive analyses of the effects of sex and age showed no significant impact on the levels of copper chaperones or copper distribution across cellular compartments.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a strong association between reduced CCS levels and AD pathology, highlighting a potential role for CCS in the redistribution of copper ions within neurons. This redistribution may contribute to oxidative stress and neuronal dysfunction, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis.",Brain Sci,2025
40103931,Sex-related differences in genetically determined Alzheimer's disease.,"We reviewed the literature on sex differences in genetically determined Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), Down syndrome-associated AD (DSAD), and APOE4 homozygosity, particularly regarding disease penetrance, symptom onset and clinical progression, and trajectories for markers of amyloidosis (A), tau pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N). Data suggests that sex differences in disease penetrance, symptom onset, and AT(N) biomarker trajectories are typically subtle for genetically determined AD populations. Noteworthy exceptions, such as increased neurodegeneration in later stages of the disease in females while similar cognitive outcomes, suggest a potential differential cognitive reserve that warrants further investigation. Additionally, the interaction between APOE genotype and sex reveals complex and multifaceted effects in DSAD, with potential implications for ADAD that remain underexplored. The smaller sex differences observed compared to sporadic AD offer insights into the different underlying disease mechanisms in genetically determined AD populations. Future research should prioritize sex-specific investigations in genetically determined AD, focusing on refining methodologies. This includes prioritizing longitudinal designs, adjustment for key confounders, and adherence to sex-specific guidelines.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40008916,"Comparing Alzheimer's genes in African, European, and Amerindian induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia.","INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate ancestry-specific loci. Previous studies in the regulatory architecture have only been conducted in Europeans (EUs), thus studies in additional ancestries are needed. Given the prevalence of AD genes expressed in microglia, we initiated our studies in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived microglia.
METHODS: We created iPSC-derived microglia from 13 individuals of either high Amerindian (AI), African (AF), or EU global ancestry, including both AD and controls. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and pathway analyses were compared between ancestries in both AD and non-AD genes.
RESULTS: Twelve AD genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and/or accessible between ancestries, including ABI3, CTSB, and MS4A6A. A total of 5% of all genes had differential ancestral expression, but differences in accessibility were less than 1%. The DEGs were enriched in known AD pathways.
DISCUSSION: This resource will be valuable in evaluating AD in admixed populations and other neurological disorders and understanding the AD risk differences between populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: First comparison of the genomics of AI, AF, and EU microglia. Report differences in expression and accessibility of AD genes between ancestries. Ancestral expression differences are greater than differences in accessibility. Good transcriptome correlation was seen between brain and iPSC-derived microglia. Differentially expressed AD genes were in known AD pathways.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

The study aimed to initially explore the relationship between plasma exosomal microRNAs, gut microbiota, and cognitive impairment, providing insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of AD.
METHODS: The study enrolled 8 participants with AD and 8 participants with normal cognition. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was utilized to evaluate cognitive function. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma exosomes, while metagenomic sequencing was employed to detect differences in the abundance of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the associations among them were analyzed.
RESULTS: Four exosomal miRNAs and 14 microbiota taxa, which exhibited differential expression and abundance, respectively, in comparison between AD group and normal cognition group, were identified to be significantly associated with MMSE scores. Notably, the abundance of potential probiotics, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis and Roseburia inulinivorans, which was decreased in AD patients, exhibited positive correlations with specific exosomal miRNAs: Roseburia intestinalis correlated with miR-3120-3p and miR-6529-5p; Roseburia inulinivorans correlated with miR-3120-3p, miR-6529-5p and miR-124-3p; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii correlated with miR-3120-3p.
DISCUSSION: The study revealed a close association among gut microbiota, plasma exosomal miRNAs, and cognitive impairment in AD, and suggested that specific components of gut microbiota and exosomal miRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Front Neurosci,2025

A powerful, yet largely uncharacterized form of neuronal inhibition-GABA<sub>A, slow</sub> synaptic current-was studied using whole-cell recordings in hippocampal brain slices from AD model mice (tg-APPSwe). The investigators found that GABA<sub>A, slow</sub> inhibition was significantly reduced in dentate granule neurons from aged AD mice, compared to both wild type and adult non-aged AD mice. This reduction would nicely explain the change in excitatory-inhibitory balance previously reported in this and other AD model animals, as well as impairments in pattern separation and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling that are early manifestations of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39748848,Emerging Alzheimer's disease treatment paradigms: A late-stage clinical trial review.,"INTRODUCTION: Without disease-modifying interventions, Medicare and Medicaid spending on Alzheimer's disease (AD) management is expected to reach 637 billion USD annually by 2050. The recent advent of promising AD therapies after decades of a near-total failure rate in clinical trials suggests that more disease-modifying therapies are on the horizon. In this review, we assess the late-stage pipeline of disease-modifying candidates for AD and offer a novel classification of intervention candidates by treatment paradigms-groups of candidates that share an underlying biological mechanism of action and general disease target.
METHODS: We extracted data from the National Library of Medicine clinical trials database regarding Phase 2 and 3 trials of disease-modifying AD therapies. We categorized trials into eight unique treatment paradigms, which we defined by combinations of therapy (biologic, small molecule, cell and gene therapy, other) and target (amyloid, tau, other). We analyzed primary endpoints, eligibility criteria including clinical ratings of cognition, trial phase and length, and funding sources.
RESULTS: We identified 123 unique disease-modifying intervention candidates in 175 late-stage clinical trials. Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, respectively. Eligibility criteria favored patients between the ages of 60 and 80 years with mild cognitive impairment. Including multi-phase trials, 81% of studies were engaged in Phase 2 and 27% in Phase 3. Notably, within the Biologic-Amyloid paradigm, 64% of trials were engaged in Phase 3.
DISCUSSION: Current studies of disease-modifying therapies for AD comprise a diverse set of approaches to treating the disease. However, effort is largely concentrated in a few treatment paradigms and a narrow patient population, causing varying rates of progress among treatment paradigms in the late-stage clinical trial pipeline. Strategies may be warranted to accelerate successes in the most promising therapeutical paradigms and nurture growth within nascent areas lacking resources but not potential.
HIGHLIGHTS: An analysis of Alzheimer's disease trial treatment paradigms was conducted.From April 2021 to March 2023, 175 trials of 123 unique candidates were reviewed.Biologic and small molecule drugs comprised 30% and 54% of trials, respectively.Eligibility criteria favored ages 60 through 80 with mild cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39922529,Alterations in iron levels in the locus coeruleus of a transgenic Alzheimer's disease rat model.,"Iron is essential for brain function, acting as a cofactor for enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. However, dysregulated iron homeostasis is increasingly linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The locus coeruleus (LC), a norepinephrine-producing brainstem nucleus, is among the earliest regions affected in AD, yet its iron dynamics remain poorly understood. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of iron content in the LC by combining a transgenic AD rat model, precise anatomical isolation, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry for high-sensitivity metal quantification. This approach enabled the profiling of iron and zinc concentrations in the LC, uncovering novel insights into iron dysregulation in AD. We observed a significant genotype-specific increase in LC iron levels in TgF344-AD rats compared to wild-type controls. Notably, our findings reveal distinct iron alterations in TgF344-AD rats, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for iron homeostasis in LC dysfunction. These results provide new perspectives on iron dysregulation in AD pathology and its potential as a therapeutic target.",Neurosci Lett,2025

For longitudinal measures (n = 351), multistate non-Markov was applied to generate transition probability estimates.ResultsOur analyses gave 4 possible subgroups of MCI patients: 1) increased cognitive reserve, 2) suspected AD pathology, 3) psychological manifestations, and 4) cardiovascular risk factors. Progression within these subgroups showed variations. The likelihood of progressing to AD dementia was estimated over a range of 5 months for those with suspected AD pathology and 66 months for those with psychological manifestations.ConclusionsOur findings support the significance of computational methods to improve the characterization and prognosis of MCI patients. We suggest that these four MCI subgroups should be considered for clinical monitoring.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39815764,"New Horizons in Menopause, Menopausal Hormone Therapy, and Alzheimer's Disease: Current Insights and Future Directions.","Accumulating evidence suggests that the effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) and all-cause dementia are influenced by timing of initiation relative to age, time-since-menopause, and the type of formulation. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of MHT conducted in postmenopausal women ages 65 and older indicated an increased risk of dementia. While RCTs conducted in midlife are lacking, observational research has provided evidence for associations between midlife estrogen-only therapy (ET) use and a reduced risk of AD and dementia, whereas estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) was associated with more variable outcomes. However, existing studies are heterogenous, and conventional endpoints might not adequately assess MHT's potential for AD prevention. Herein, several approaches are being discussed, and the case is being made for utilizing AD biomarkers for assessment of early, AD-specific outcomes in relation to MHT use. From a clinical standpoint, findings that MHT may lower dementia risk warrant consideration as existing therapies like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine lack preventative efficacy, and vaccines for primary or secondary prevention are not yet available. MHT-associated risks, including breast cancer, stroke and venous thromboembolism, are generally considered rare (<10 events/10 000 women). Overall, the literature supports renewed research interest in evaluating MHT as a female-specific, time-sensitive approach for AD risk reduction, which is key to applying cumulated data in clinical decision making concerning AD prevention.",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,2025

PF induced by ADP were assessed by optical density and white matter changes by MRI Axial FLAIR. Serum levels of von Willebrand Factor and GP1b were measured by ELISA. Platelet receptor expressions of CD62P and CD42b (GPIb) were measured by flow cytometry, and levels of hsa-miR-26a-5p and hsa-miR-24-3p by qRT-PCR.ResultsADP-induced PF was significantly reduced in AD (p = 0.016). Flow cytometry showed significantly low CD42b and high CD62P expression in AD, respectively (p < 0.0001, p = 0.014). Serum GP1b levels were significantly higher in AD (p = 0.018).

We defined SERBP1's interactome, uncovered novel roles in splicing, cell division and ribosomal biogenesis, and showed its participation in pathological stress granules and Tau aggregates in Alzheimer's brains. SERBP1 preferentially interacts with other G-quadruplex (G4) binders, implicated in different stages of gene expression, suggesting that G4 binding is a critical component of SERBP1 function in different settings. Similarly, we identified important associations between SERBP1 and PARP1/polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation). SERBP1 interacts with PARP1 and its associated factors and influences PARylation. Moreover, protein complexes in which SERBP1 participates contain mostly PARylated proteins and PAR binders. Based on these results, we propose a feedback regulatory model in which SERBP1 influences PARP1 function and PARylation, while PARylation modulates SERBP1 functions and participation in regulatory complexes.",Elife,2025
40038506,Characterizing heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease progression: a semiparametric model.,"The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia worldwide, is known for its variability and complexity, challenging the conventional methods of monitoring and predicting disease trajectories. This study introduces a semiparametric modeling approach to analyze longitudinal cognitive and imaging data. We studied two different outcome variables from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database: the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS13) scores and ventricular volumes [Formula: see text]. Unlike traditional linear mixed effects models, semiparametric models do not assume a linear AD progression over time. Semiparametric models offer the advantage of capturing the non-linear features of AD progression, such as cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, represented by changes in ADAS13 scores and ventricular enlargement, respectively. By integrating regression splines and mixed modeling techniques, we provide a nuanced understanding of AD progression that captures the heterogeneity of disease trajectories. Our analysis reveals variations in the timing and degree of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration among AD patients, underlining the need for personalized approaches for monitoring and managing AD. This study's findings contribute to the modeling of AD progression and offer potential implications for interventions and prognostic assessments in clinical and research settings.",Sci Rep,2025
39989971,Systems-Level Interactome Mapping Reveals Actionable Protein Network Dysregulation Across the Alzheimer's Disease Spectrum.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses as a continuum, from preclinical stages to late-stage cognitive decline, yet the molecular mechanisms driving this progression remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a systems-level map of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network dysfunction across the AD spectrum and uncover epichaperomes-stable scaffolding platforms formed by chaperones and co-factors-as central drivers of this process. Using over 100 human brain specimens, mouse models, and human neurons, we show that epichaperomes emerge early, even in preclinical AD, and progressively disrupt multiple PPI networks critical for synaptic function and neuroplasticity. Glutamatergic neurons, essential for learning and memory, exhibit heightened vulnerability, with their dysfunction driven by protein sequestration into epichaperome scaffolds, independent of changes in protein expression. Notably, pharmacological disruption of epichaperomes with PU-AD restores PPI network integrity and reverses synaptic and cognitive deficits, directly linking epichaperome-driven network dysfunction to AD pathology. These findings establish epichaperomes as key mediators of molecular collapse in AD and identify network-centric intervention strategies as a promising avenue for disease-modifying therapies.",Res Sq,2025
39872979,Neuroinflammation mediates the progression of neonate hypoxia-ischemia brain damage to Alzheimer's disease: a bioinformatics and experimental study.,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can generally be divided into focal damage and diffuse damage, and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (nHIBD) is one of the causes of diffuse damage. Patients with nHIBD are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the shared pathogenesis of patients affected with both neurological disorders has not been fully elucidated.
PURPOSE: We here aim to identify the shared molecular signatures between nHIBD and AD. We used an integrated analysis of the cortex gene expression data, targeting differential expression of genes related to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury.
METHODS: The gene expression profiles of Alzheimer's disease (GSE203206) and that of Neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (GSE23317) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of Alzheimer's disease and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage by limma package analysis, five kinds of analyses were performed on them, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, DEG-transcription factor interactions and DEG-microRNA interactions, protein-drug interactions and protein-disease association analysis, and gene-inflammation association analysis and protein-inflammation association analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 12 common DEGs were identified including HSPB1, VIM, MVD, TUBB4A, AACS, ANXA6, DIRAS2, RPH3A, CEND1, KALM, THOP1, AREL1. We also identified 11 hub proteins, three central regulatory transcription factors, and three microRNAs encoded by the DEGs. Protein-drug interaction analysis showed that CYC1 and UQCRFS1 are associated with different drugs. Gene-disease association analysis shows Mammary Neoplasms, Neoplasm Metastasis, Schizophrenia, and Brain Ischemia diseases are the most relevant to the hub proteins we identified. Gene-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub gene AREL1 is related to inflammatory response, while the protein-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub proteins AKT1 and MAPK14 are related to inflammatory response.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the shared molecular mechanisms between AD and nHIBD. These common pathways and hub genes could potentially be used to design therapeutic interventions, reducing the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease development in survivors of neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemia brain injury.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39702308,Analytical and clinical performance of eight Simoa<sup>®</sup> and Lumipulse<sup>®</sup> assays for automated measurement of plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217.,"BACKGROUND: Among the Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers measured in blood, phosphorylated forms of tau (p-tau) have been shown to exhibit a particularly high diagnostic potential. Here, we performed a comprehensive method comparison study, followed by evaluation of the diagnostic performance of eight recent plasma p-tau immunoassays targeting different tau phosphorylation sites, different tau fragments, and that are measured by two distinct platforms.
METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of 40 patients with AD at the stage of dementia (AD-dem) characterized by positive CSF A + T + profile, and a control group of 40 cognitively healthy participants (Control), to conduct a comprehensive method comparison for three plasma p-tau181 and five plasma p-tau217 assays run on the Simoa<sup>®</sup> HD-X™ or Lumipulse<sup>®</sup> G600II/G1200 platforms. Design of the compared assays differed in regard to: (1) tau phosphorylation site targeted by the capture antibody (T181 or T217), and (2) epitope of the pan-tau detector antibody (N-terminal or mid-region). For each of the assays we determined precision and analytical sensitivity parameters and used Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plots for pairwise comparison of p-tau181 or p-tau217 assays. Subsequently, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of all the assays for discrimination between AD-dem and Control groups.
RESULTS: We found a strong, positive correlation between all the measurements. Fixed and/or proportional bias was observed for each of compared p-tau181 assay pairs or p-tau217 assay pairs. While both plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels were significantly increased in AD-dem vs. Control groups as measured by all assays, higher median concentration AD-dem/Control fold change and AUC values were observed for p-tau217 (assays range: fold change 3.72-6.74, AUC 0.916-0.956) compared with p-tau181 (assays range 1.81-2.94, AUC 0.829-0.909), independently of the platform used. No significant differences were observed between diagnostic performance of p-tau181 assays or p-tau217 assays targeting tau N-terminus or mid-region.
CONCLUSIONS: Although all plasma p-tau measurements enabled discrimination between clinical groups, p-tau217 assays showed the highest robustness, independently of the pan-tau detector antibody targeting N-terminal or mid-region, and independently of the platform used. Considering the observed method disagreement in measured absolute concentrations, we stress the need for development of certified reference material, harmonizing measurements across different platforms.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39880319,Alzheimer's disease risk ABCA7 p.A696S variant disturbs the microglial response to amyloid pathology in mice.,"The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) gene is ranked as one of the top susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While ABCA7 mediates lipid transport across cellular membranes, ABCA7 loss of function has been shown to exacerbate amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and compromise microglial function. Our family-based study uncovered an extremely rare ABCA7 p.A696S variant that was substantially segregated with the development of AD in 3 African American families. Using the knockin mouse model, we investigated the effects of ABCA7-A696S substitution on amyloid pathology and brain immune response in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Importantly, our study demonstrated that ABCA7-A696S substitution reduces amyloid plaque-associated microgliosis and increases dystrophic neurites around amyloid deposits compared to control mice. We also found increased X-34-positive amyloid plaque burden in 5xFAD mice with ABCA7-A696S substitution, while there was no evident difference in insoluble Aβ levels between mouse groups. Thus, ABCA7-A696S substitution may disrupt amyloid compaction resulting in aggravated neuritic dystrophy due to insufficient microglia barrier function. In addition, we observed that ABCA7-A696S substitution disturbs the induction of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β and interferon γ in the brains of 5xFAD mice, although some disease-associated microglia gene expression, including Trem2 and Tyrobp, are upregulated. Lipidomics also detected higher total lysophosphatidylethanolamine levels in the brains of 5xFAD mice with ABCA7-A696S substitution than controls. These results suggest that ABCA7-A696S substitution might compromise the adequate innate immune response to amyloid pathology in AD by modulating brain lipid metabolism, providing novel insight into the pathogenic mechanisms mediated by ABCA7.

39732516,Brain phosphoproteomic analysis identifies diabetes-related substrates in Alzheimer's disease pathology in older adults.,"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Insulin signaling dysfunction exacerbates tau protein phosphorylation, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, the comprehensive impact of diabetes on patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in the human brain remains underexplored.
METHODS: We performed tandem mass tag-based phosphoproteome profiling in post mortem human brain prefrontal cortex samples from 191 deceased older adults with and without diabetes and pathologic AD.
RESULTS: Among 7874 quantified phosphosites, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) phosphorylated at T529 and T534 (isoform 8 T212 and T217) were more abundant in AD and showed differential associations with diabetes. Network analysis of co-abundance patterns uncovered synergistic interactions between AD and diabetes, with one module exhibiting higher MAPT phosphorylation (15 MAPT phosphosites) and another displaying lower MAP1B phosphorylation (22 MAP1B phosphosites).
DISCUSSION: This study offers phosphoproteomics insights into AD in diabetes, shedding light on mechanisms that can inform the development of therapeutics for dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is increased among older adults living with diabetes. The patterns of AD-related phosphoprotein in the human brain in older adults are differential among older adults living with diabetes. Microtubule-associated protein tau phosphorylated at T529 and T534 (isoform 8 T212 and T217) showed differential associations with diabetes. Phosphosite co-abundance networks of synergistic interactions between AD and diabetes were identified.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39698934,"Alzheimer's disease-associated CD83(+) microglia are linked with increased immunoglobulin G4 and human cytomegalovirus in the gut, vagal nerve, and brain.","INTRODUCTION: While there may be microbial contributions to Alzheimer's disease (AD), findings have been inconclusive. We recently reported an AD-associated CD83(+) microglia subtype associated with increased immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in the transverse colon (TC).
METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry (IHC), IgG4 repertoire profiling, and brain organoid experiments to explore this association.
RESULTS: CD83(+) microglia in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) are associated with elevated IgG4 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the TC, anti-HCMV IgG4 in cerebrospinal fluid, and both HCMV and IgG4 in the SFG and vagal nerve. This association was replicated in an independent AD cohort. HCMV-infected cerebral organoids showed accelerated AD pathophysiological features (Aβ42 and pTau-212) and neuronal death.
DISCUSSION: Findings indicate complex, cross-tissue interactions between HCMV and the adaptive immune response associated with CD83(+) microglia in persons with AD. This may indicate an opportunity for antiviral therapy in persons with AD and biomarker evidence of HCMV, IgG4, or CD83(+) microglia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cross-tissue interaction between HCMV and the adaptive immune response in a subset of persons with AD. Presence of CD83(+) microglial associated with IgG4 and HCMV in the gut. CD83(+) microglia are also associated presence of HCMV and IgG4 in the cortex and vagal nerve. Replication of key association in an independent cohort of AD subjects.

39752483,Comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional landscape in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading dementia among the elderly with complex origins. Despite extensive investigation into the AD-associated protein-coding genes, the involvement of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and posttranscriptional modification (PTM) in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively characterized the landscape of ncRNAs and PTM events in 1460 samples across six brain regions sourced from the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank Study and Mayo cohorts, encompassing 33,321 long ncRNAs, 92,897 enhancer RNAs, 53,763 alternative polyadenylation events, and 900,221 A-to-I RNA editing events. We additionally identified 25,351 aberrantly expressed ncRNAs and altered PTM events associated with AD traits and further identified the corresponding protein-coding genes to construct regulatory networks. Furthermore, we developed a user-friendly data portal, ADatlas, facilitating users in exploring our results. Our study aims to establish a comprehensive data platform for ncRNAs and PTMs in AD to advance related research.",Sci Adv,2025
40029927,Retinal and thalamic alterations in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that lead to decreased quality of life due to behavioral, motor, and cognitive impairments. Due to the widespread pathological nature of AD, many brain regions are affected by Aβ plaques including regions important for vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus which is critical for relaying signals from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Using a wide range of techniques including electrophysiological approaches, in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods, and immunohistochemistry in a mouse model with progressing amyloidosis (5xFAD), the goal of this study was to determine whether AD-like pathology disrupts neuronal and synaptic structure and function in the visual system. In vivo electroretinogram recordings revealed photoreceptor dysfunction in the 6- and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, while optical coherence tomography indicated no changes in 5xFAD retinal thickness from 9 to 12 months. In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the rodent homolog of the primate LGN, we identified decreased densities of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals and fewer thalamocortical (TC) neuron cell bodies. No detectable deficits in excitatory synaptic function or TC neuron dendritic structure were seen in the dLGN, and reflexive visual behavior was also found to be normal in the 5xFAD mice. These results indicate relatively modest amyloid-triggered dysfunction in these stages of the visual system suggesting that Aβ plaque formation may play only a small role in the visual system dysfunction seen in AD patients. These results may also point to potential compensatory mechanisms that preserve function of visual pathways in the 5xFAD visual system.",PLoS One,2025
39930283,Overexpression of TGFBR3 Aggravates Cognitive Impairment and Neuroinflammation by Promoting Microglia M1 Polarization in the APP/PS1 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (TGFBR3), also known as betaglycan, is a member of the TGF-β receptor family. In our previous study, bioinformatics analysis revealed that TGFBR3 levels are elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identified TGFBR3 as a potential risk factor for the disease. However, the precise role of TGFBR3 in the pathogenesis of AD remains largely unclear. In this study, we first validated the elevated levels of TGFBR3 in postmortem brain tissues from AD patients using immunohistochemical staining. Subsequently, gain-of-function experiments and behavioral tests were conducted to explore the functional role of TGFBR3 in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Our findings confirmed that TGFBR3 levels were significantly increased in AD patients compared to normal controls. Overexpression of TGFBR3 in APP/PS1 mice impaired spatial learning and memory abilities and promoted amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. Additionally, TGFBR3 overexpression exacerbated neuronal apoptosis and synaptic loss. We also observed that overexpression of TGFBR3 triggered an inflammatory response by promoting microglial polarization to the M1 phenotype, although it had no effect on astrocyte activation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that increased TGFBR3 levels worsen cognitive impairment and accelerate pathological progression in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that TGFBR3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40189804,Structural changes in cerebral microvasculature induced by ferroptosis contribute to blood-brain barrier disruption in Alzheimer's disease: an autopsy study.,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular lesions are associated with cognitive impairment. However, the impact of AD neuropathological changes (ADNC) on cerebral microvasculature is not completely understood.
METHODS: Twelve decedents with ADNC and 15 matched controls were selected from the Brain Bank. The changes in the median tunica and basement membrane-related extracellular matrix (ECM) contents of the microvasculature were quantified and compared. Additionally, we explored the related mechanisms of agrin in pericytes.
RESULTS: Venular collagenosis was significantly more severe in AD patients (p < 0.001), and ECM remolding was significantly correlated with ADNC. In the AD group, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and decreased pericytes were observed. Finally, we confirmed that agrin induced ferroptosis in pericytes and BBB disruption in vitro.
DISCUSSION: Our data indicate that venular collagenosis and significant ECM remolding are important contributors to ADNC. The mechanism by which agrin's role in disrupting the BBB by inducing ferroptosis presents a potential new target.
HIGHLIGHTS: Changes in the median tunica and basement membrane-related ECM contents of the microvasculature were quantified in human brains. Venular collagenosis was significantly more severe in AD patients. In the AD group, BBB disruption and ECM remodeling were important contributors to AD neuropathological changes.

40167260,A Call for Improving Clinical and Cognitive Assessments to Reduce the Gap Between Amyloid/Tau Pathology Onset and Detection of Cognitive Dysfunction.,"In this commentary, we discuss the new perspectives on the definition and criteria for Alzheimer's disease, particularly in relation to the biological and clinical-biological approaches. We argue that research must continue to focus on improving clinical and cognitive tools to contextualize biomarker findings and understand the clinical implications of different pathophysiological processes at the individual level. We propose several solutions, including the development of ""cognitive stress tests,"" digital clinical biomarkers, innovative analytical procedures, more refined studies for collecting rigorous and longitudinal normative data, and, ultimately, enhanced clinical skills. Overall, these strategies could help ""shorten"" the preclinical period and bridge the gap between the biological and clinical-biological approaches by aligning biomarker abnormalities with the onset of cognitive dysfunction more effectively.",J Am Geriatr Soc,2025
40038765,The neuroimmune nexus: unraveling the role of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING signal pathway in Alzheimer's disease.,"The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuroimmunity has gradually begun to be unveiled. Emerging evidence indicates that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) acts as a cytosolic DNA sensor, recognizing cytosolic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and inducing the innate immune response by activating stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Dysregulation of this pathway culminates in AD-related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. A substantial body of evidence indicates that mitochondria are involved in the critical pathogenic mechanisms of AD, whose damage leads to the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the extramitochondrial space. This leaked mtDNA serves as a DAMP, activating various pattern recognition receptors and immune defense networks in the brain, including the cGAS-STING pathway, ultimately leading to an imbalance in immune homeostasis. Therefore, modulation of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway to restore neuroimmune homeostasis may offer promising prospects for improving AD treatment outcomes. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of mtDNA release during stress and the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Additionally, we delve into the research progress on this pathway in AD, and further discuss the primary directions and potential hurdles in developing targeted therapeutic drugs, to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and provide new approaches for its therapy.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40046785,"Talking during walking: the diagnostic potential of turn dynamics in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitive aging.","BACKGROUND: While gait analysis is well-documented, turn performance-which is a more complex task and involves multiple brain regions-has been less explored. This study aims to assess the diagnostic potential of turn dynamics as a novel tool for detecting cognitive decline.
METHODS: We recruited 75 participants, including 26 neurotypical (NT) older adults, 25 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 24 with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants completed a dual-task walk and turn (DTWT) test using a dual Kinect setup while counting backwards by ones. Key measures analyzed included spatial-temporal parameters of gait and turn dynamics. Statistical analyses including analyses of variance and linear regression were performed to identify key features as well as to assess their correlation with cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Gait speed and stride time significantly differentiated among groups in DTWT conditions. More notably, turn dynamics, particularly segmental peak speeds and step length, displayed stronger discriminatory power with more significant p-values compared to gait features. Linear regression analysis indicated that turn dynamics had stronger correlations with executive function and working memory, suggesting a more pronounced relationship between cognitive performance and turn features than gait variables.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to straight walk metrics, this study shows that DTWT turn dynamics are more sensitive to detect cognitive impairment. Consequently, incorporating turning movements into gait analysis techniques could enhance diagnostic protocols in clinical settings, offering a valuable tool for monitoring the progression of conditions associated with cognitive aging.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40004604,Plasma Biomarkers for Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Implications for Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities: A Comprehensive Review.,"Anti-amyloid therapies (AATs) are increasingly being recognized as promising treatment options for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), small areas of edema and microbleeds in the brain presenting as abnormal signals in MRIs of the brain for patients with AD, are the most common side effects of AATs. While most ARIAs are asymptomatic, they can be associated with symptoms like nausea, headache, confusion, and gait instability and, less commonly, with more serious complications such as seizures and death. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been found to be a major risk for ARIA development. The identification of sensitive and reliable non-invasive biomarkers for CAA has been an area of AD research over the years, but with the approval of AATs, this area has taken on a new urgency. This comprehensive review highlights several potential biomarkers, such as Aβ40, Aβ40/42, phosphorylated-tau217, neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein, secreted phosphoprotein 1, placental growth factor, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, cluster of differentiation 163, proteomics, and microRNA. Identifying and staging CAA even before its consequences can be detected via neuroimaging are critical to allow clinicians to judiciously select appropriate candidates for AATs, stratify monitoring, properly manage therapeutic regimens for those experiencing symptomatic ARIAs, and optimize the treatment to achieve the best outcomes. Future studies can test potential plasma biomarkers in human beings and evaluate predictive values of individual markers for CAA severity.",J Clin Med,2025

This study aimed to explore the research frontiers and hotspots through bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: Literature related to AD and ferroptosis was collected from the Web of Science Core Collection. Data, including countries, authors, institutions, journals, and keywords, were analyzed by Tableau Public Desktop and Citespace software.
RESULTS: A total of 305 articles published between January 1st, 2013, and December 31st, 2023, were included, and the number of articles on the relationship between AD and ferroptosis has increased annually, with the largest number reported from China (162 articles). The articles from Professor SJ Dixon were cited most frequently. Among the top ten most cited articles, four were published in top journals. The University of Melbourne emerged as the institution with the highest number of publications (27 articles). Among the journals, most of the articles were published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience (13 articles, accounting for 4.26%). The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that major hotspots in this field contained oxidative stress, cell death, and lipid peroxidation. Keyword burst analysis indicated that antioxidant was the term with the longest duration of high interest, while clustering analysis showed that this research area primarily focused on amyloid precursor protein, drug development, and diagnostic models.

39822072,Neural deterioration and compensation in visual short-term memory among individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is a critical indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether its neural substrates could adapt to early disease progression and contribute to cognitive resilience in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been unclear.
METHODS: Fifty-five aMCI patients and 68 normal controls (NC) performed a change-detection task and underwent multimodal neuroimaging scanning.
RESULTS: Among the atrophic brain regions in aMCI, VSTM performance correlated with the volume of the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and this correlation was mainly present in patients with greater MTL atrophy. Furthermore, VSTM was primarily correlated with frontal structural connectivity in aMCI but was correlated with more distributed frontal and MTL connectivity in NC.
DISCUSSION: This study provided evidence on neural adaptation in the precursor stages of AD, highlighting the compensatory role of PFC as MTL deteriorated and suggesting potential targets in early intervention for cognitive preservation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Atrophic left medial temporal lobe (MTL) no longer correlated with visual short-term memory (VSTM) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Atrophic right middle frontal area continued to correlate with VSTM in aMCI. Frontal brain-behavior correlation was mainly present in the aMCI subgroup with greater medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. Reliance of VSTM on frontal connectivity increased in compensation for MTL dysfunction.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39696466,The UFMylation pathway is impaired in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated tau and senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid. These pathognomonic deposits have been implicated in the pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms and consequences remain undetermined. UFM1 is an important, but understudied ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently attached to substrates. UFMylation has recently been identified as major modifier of tau aggregation upon seeding in experimental models. However, potential alterations of the UFM1 pathway in human AD brain have not been investigated yet.
METHODS: Here we used frontal and temporal cortex samples from individuals with or without AD to measure the protein levels of the UFMylation pathway in human brain. We used multivariable regression analyses followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to analyze associations of the UFMylation pathway with neuropathological characteristics, primary biochemical measurements of tau and additional biochemical markers from the same cases. We further studied associations of the UFMylation cascade with cellular stress pathways using Spearman correlations with bulk RNAseq expression data and functionally validated these interactions using gene-edited neurons that were generated by CRISPR-Cas9.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, human AD brain had increased protein levels of UFM1. Our data further indicates that this increase mainly reflects conjugated UFM1 indicating hyperUFMylation in AD. UFMylation was strongly correlated with pathological tau in both AD-affected brain regions. In addition, we found that the levels of conjugated UFM1 were negatively correlated with soluble levels of the deUFMylation enzyme UFSP2. Functional analysis of UFM1 and/or UFSP2 knockout neurons revealed that the DNA damage response as well as the unfolded protein response are perturbed by changes in neuronal UFM1 signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: There are marked changes in the UFMylation pathway in human AD brain. These changes are significantly associated with pathological tau, supporting the idea that the UFMylation cascade might indeed act as a modifier of tau pathology in human brain. Our study further nominates UFSP2 as an attractive target to reduce the hyperUFMylation observed in AD brain but also underscores the critical need to identify risks and benefits of manipulating the UFMylation pathway as potential therapeutic avenue for AD.",Mol Neurodegener,2024
39757785,Elevated p16Ink4a Expression Enhances Tau Phosphorylation in Neurons Differentiated From Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.,"Increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16Ink4a (p16) is detected in neurons of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and during normal aging. Importantly, selective eliminating p16-expressing cells in AD mouse models attenuates tau pathologies and improves cognition. But whether and how p16 contributes to AD pathogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, we tested whether induction of p16 expression in neurons exacerbates AD pathologies. We created a doxycycline-inducible system to trigger p16 up-regulation in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neurons differentiated from iPSCs. We demonstrated that up-regulated p16 expression in iPSCs reduces cell proliferation, down-regulates cell cycle genes, and up-regulates genes involved in focal adhesion, interferon α response and PI3K-Akt signaling. Our approach enables temporal control of p16 induction upon differentiation from iPSCs to neurons. In differentiated cortical neurons, we found that up-regulation of p16 increases tau phosphorylation at Ser202/Thr205 and Thr231 in a cell-autonomous manner, while amyloid beta secretion is not affected. These data suggest a critical role of p16 in regulating tau phosphorylation in neurons, and thereby contributing to pathological progression of AD. As pathological tau tangles have been shown to induce p16 expression, our studies suggest a positive feedback loop between p16 and tau to exacerbate tau pathologies.",Aging Cell,2025
39724914,A machine learning approach to automate microinfarct and microhemorrhage screening in hematoxylin and eosin-stained human brain tissues.,"Microinfarcts and microhemorrhages are characteristic lesions of cerebrovascular disease. Although multiple studies have been published, there is no one universal standard criteria for the neuropathological assessment of cerebrovascular disease. In this study, we propose a novel application of machine learning in the automated screening of microinfarcts and microhemorrhages. Utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) from postmortem human brain samples, we adapted a patch-based pipeline with convolutional neural networks. Our cohort consisted of 22 cases from the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank with hematoxylin and eosin-stained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections across 3 anatomical areas: frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes (40 WSIs with microinfarcts and/or microhemorrhages, 26 without). We propose a multiple field-of-view prediction step to mitigate false positives. We report screening performance (ie, the ability to distinguish microinfarct/microhemorrhage-positive from microinfarct/microhemorrhage-negative WSIs), and detection performance (ie, the ability to localize the affected regions within a WSI). Our proposed approach improved detection precision and screening accuracy by reducing false positives thereby achieving 100% screening accuracy. Although this sample size is small, this pipeline provides a proof-of-concept for high efficacy in screening for characteristic brain changes of cerebrovascular disease to aid in screening of microinfarcts/microhemorrhages at the WSI level.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2025
39814008,"ApoE3 R136S binds to Tau and blocks its propagation, suppressing neurodegeneration in mice with Alzheimer's disease.","PSEN1 E280A carrier for the APOE3 Christchurch variant (R136S) is protected against Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms with a distinct anatomical pattern of Tau pathology. However, the molecular mechanism accounting for this protective effect remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ApoE3 R136S mutant strongly binds to Tau and reduces its uptake into neurons and microglia compared with ApoE3 wild type (WT), diminishing Tau fragmentation by asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), proinflammatory cytokines by Tau pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) or β-amyloid (Aβ), and neurotoxicity. Further, ApoE3 R136S demonstrates more robust effects in attenuating AEP activation and Tau PFF spreading in the brains of both 5xFAD and Tau P301S mice than in ApoE3 WT, leading to improved cognitive functions. Thus, our findings support the idea that ApoE3 R136S strongly binds Tau and decreases its cellular uptake, abrogating Tau pathology propagation in AD brains.",Neuron,2025
39814561,Explainable deep neural networks for predicting sample phenotypes from single-cell transcriptomics.,"Recent advances in single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies have revolutionized our ability to gather molecular insights into different phenotypes at the level of individual cells. The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to their unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. Furthermore, existing methods for this purpose have limitations in their usability. Those reasons motivated us to develop singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes. We used singleDeep to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease and coronavirus disease 2019. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, singleDeep outperformed traditional machine learning methods and alternative single-cell approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.",Brief Bioinform,2024
40123371,Improving executive functioning and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease with music therapy: A narrative review of potential neural mechanisms.,"The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the concurrent cost of healthcare will increase as the population continues to age. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively manage symptoms of AD but carry side effects and ineffectively address underlying causes and disease prevention. Non-pharmaceutical interventions for AD, such as music training and therapy do not carry these side effects and can improve symptoms, and should therefore be explored as stand-alone or co-therapy for AD. In addition, music encapsulates modifiable lifestyle factors, such as cognitive stimulation, that have been shown to delay progression of and prevent AD. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning how music improves AD symptoms are not fully understood and whether music can target compensatory processes, activate neural networks, or even slow or prevent AD needs further research. Research suggests neural mechanism may involve stimulating brain areas to promote neurogenesis, dopaminergic rewards systems, and the default mode network (DMN). Alternatively, this review proposes that music improve symptoms of AD via the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN), the salience network (SN) and DMN, and neural compensation. This review will then present evidence for how music could activate the FPCN, SN, and DMN to improve their efficiency, organization, and cognitive functions they govern, protecting the brain from damage, slowing progression, and possibly preventing AD. Establishing how music improves symptoms of AD can lead to tailored music therapy protocols that target functional neural networks responsible for impaired executive functions common in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40156934,Sex-specific decline in prefrontal cortex mitochondrial bioenergetics in aging baboons correlates with walking speed.,"Mitochondria play a crucial role in brain homeostasis and changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics are linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We investigated changes in the activities of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in normally aging baboon brains and determined how these changes relate to donor sex, morning cortisol levels, and walking speed. We assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics from archived prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissues from a large cohort (60 individuals) of well-characterized aging baboons (6.6-22.8 years, approximately equivalent to 26.4-91.2 human years). Aging was associated with a decline in mitochondrial ETC complexes in the PFC, which was more pronounced when normalized for citrate synthase activity, suggesting that the decline is predominantly driven by changes in the specific activity of individual complexes rather than global changes in mitochondrial content. When donor sex was used as a covariate, we found that ETC activity was preserved with age in females and declined in males. Males had higher activities of each individual ETC complex and greater lactate dehydrogenase activity at a given age relative to females. Circulating cortisol negatively correlated with walking speed when male and female data were combined. We also observed a robust positive predictive relationship between walking speed and respiration linked to complexes I, III, and IV in males but not in females. This data reveals a link between frailty and PFC bioenergetic function and highlights a potential molecular mechanism for sexual dimorphism in brain resilience.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39807681,Clinical criteria for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy.,"Limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is highly prevalent in late life and a common co-pathology with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). LATE-NC is a slowly progressive, amnestic clinical syndrome. Alternatively, when present with ADNC, LATE-NC is associated with a more rapid course. With the emergence of anti-amyloid therapeutics, discrimination of LATE-NC from ADNC is critical and will lead to greater clinical recognition of amnestic patients without ADNC. Furthermore, co-pathology with LATE-NC may influence outcomes of these therapeutics. Thus there is a need to identify patients during life with likely LATE-NC. We propose criteria for clinical diagnosis of LATE as an initial framework for further validation. In the context of progressive memory loss and substantial hippocampal atrophy, criteria are laid out for probable (amyloid negative) or possible LATE (amyloid biomarkers are unavailable or when amyloid is present, but hippocampal neurodegeneration is out of proportion to expected pure ADNC). HIGHLIGHTS: Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a highly prevalent driver of neuropathologic memory loss in late life. LATE neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is a common co-pathology with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and may influence outcomes with emerging disease-modifying medicines. We provide initial clinical criteria for diagnosing LATE during life either when LATE-NC is the likely primary driver of symptoms or when observed in conjunction with AD. Definitions of possible and probable LATE are provided.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39998175,Mechanisms of comorbidity between Alzheimer's disease and pain.,"Clinical studies have revealed a significant correlation between pain and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, due to cognitive and speech impairments, AD patients, especially those in moderate to severe stages, are often overlooked in pain management. The challenges in obtaining pain-related information from this population exacerbate the issue. Although recent clinical research has increasingly recognized the comorbidity of AD and pain, the pathological alterations and interactive mechanisms underlying this relationship remain inadequately explored. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and pathological mechanisms of AD with and without pain comorbidity. It examines underlying processes, including neuroinflammation, peripheral-central immune interactions, and neurotransmitter dynamics. Furthermore, it highlights current pain assessment and management strategies in AD patients. By offering a theoretical framework, this review aims to support the development of effective pain management approaches and serve as a reference for clinical interventions targeting AD-associated pain. HIGHLIGHTS: The comorbidity between AD and CP encompasses multiple interrelated biological pathways, such as neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses. The damage to neurons and synapses in AD patients influences the brain regions responsible for processing pain, thereby reducing the pain response. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the development of both AD and CP. Enhanced inflammatory responses have an impact on the CNS and promote sensitization. Common neurotransmitter alterations exist in the comorbidity of AD and CP, influencing cognition, emotion, and pain perception.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39791204,SMOC2 promotes microglia activity and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ). It affects millions, with numbers expected to double by 2050. SMOC2, implicated in inflammation and fibrosis, may play a role in AD pathogenesis, particularly in microglial cell function, offering a potential therapeutic target.
OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to neurodegeneration, affecting cognition, language, and personality, underscoring the urgency for effective treatments. Our study investigates the role of secreted modular calcium-binding protein 2 (SMOC2) in microglial cells and its impact on AD pathology.
METHODS: We introduced SMOC2 overexpression and interference vectors into microglial cells treated with Aβ. Activity and phagocytosis were assessed using CCK8 and flow cytometry. SMOC2 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR, and protein levels of SMOC2, TGF-β1, p-NF-κB/NF-κB were analyzed by western blot. Aβ content was determined by ELISA, and immunofluorescence detected TNF-α, IL-1β, CD163, and CD206.
RESULTS: Aβ treatment inhibited microglial activity and phagocytosis, but SMOC2 disruption enhanced these functions (p < 0.05). SMOC2 overexpression increased its expression and Aβ levels, while interference reduced them (p < 0.001). SMOC2 overexpression also decreased TGF-β1, CD163, and CD206, and increased p-NF-κB/NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SMOC2 plays a crucial role in microglial cell activity, phagocytosis, and polarization, potentially through the TGF-β1/NF-κB pathway, offering insights into AD pathogenesis.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40184204,miss-SNF: a multimodal patient similarity network integration approach to handle completely missing data sources.,"MOTIVATION: Precision medicine leverages patient-specific multimodal data to improve prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of diseases. Advancing precision medicine requires the non-trivial integration of complex, heterogeneous and potentially high-dimensional data sources, such as multi-omics and clinical data. In the literature several approaches have been proposed to manage missing data, but are usually limited to the recovery of subsets of features for a subset of patients. A largely overlooked problem is the integration of multiple sources of data when one or more of them are completely missing for a subset of patients, a relatively common condition in clinical practice.
RESULTS: We propose miss-Similarity Network Fusion (miss-SNF), a novel general-purpose data integration approach designed to manage completely missing data in the context of patient similarity networks. Miss-SNF integrates incomplete unimodal patient similarity networks by leveraging a non-linear message-passing strategy borrowed from the SNF algorithm. Miss-SNF is able to recover missing patient similarities and is ""task agnostic"", in the sense that can integrate partial data for both unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks. Experimental analyses on nine cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate that miss-SNF achieves state-of-the-art results in recovering similarities and in identifying patients subgroups enriched in clinically relevant variables and having differential survival. Moreover, amputation experiments show that miss-SNF supervised prediction of cancer clinical outcomes and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with completely missing data achieves results comparable to those obtained when all the data are available.

40079562,Magnetic resonance imaging indices for early Alzheimer's disease detection: Brain clearance markers.,"The Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum is characterized by amyloid and tau protein deposition, which is partly attributable to the dysfunction of the brain clearance system. However, the specific phase in the AD continuum wherein aberrant clearance is present remains unclear. This study aimed to assess noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices related to brain clearance functions, such as choroid plexus volume (CPV), lateral ventricular volume (LVV), and the index of diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS index), across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. The CPV, LVV, and ALPS index in amyloid beta (Aβ)-negative healthy controls (HCs) and Aβ-positive HCs as well as in patients with Aβ-negative subjective cognitive decline (SCD), with Aβ-positive SCD, with mild cognitive impairment, and with AD were evaluated. The CPV and LVV were higher, whereas the ALPS index was lower in the patients with more severe disease. The ALPS index was significantly lower in Aβ-positive HCs than in Aβ-negative HCs. In SCD patients and those in the AD continuum, the MRI-based clearance markers were correlated with P-tau and T-tau protein levels and cognitive scores. In summary, brain clearance markers on MRI are associated with tau deposition, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,2025
39834248,Associations between dementia and exposure to topical glaucoma medications.,"BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that glaucoma may be associated with neurodegeneration and a higher risk of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether exposure to different categories of topical glaucoma medications is associated with differential dementia risks in people with glaucoma.
METHODS: We used data from Adult Changes in Thought, a population-based, prospective cohort study that follows cognitively normal older adults from Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) until Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia development. We included participants with a diagnosis of glaucoma, KPWA pharmacy records of filling topical glaucoma medication (alpha-adrenergic agonists [AAA], beta-adrenergic antagonists, miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors [CAI], and prostaglandins) and at least 10 years of pharmacy records. Eight-year sliding windows were derived for each medication class by computing days on each medication starting 10 years earlier and excluding the most recent 2 years. Cox regression used all 5 classes of medication simultaneously to predict AD and all-cause dementia.
RESULTS: We included 521 participants (mean age 78 [range 65-96], 62% female) with APOE genotype data. Beta-adrenergic antagonists were the most frequently prescribed (n = 431) followed by prostaglandins (351), AAA (239), CAI (162), and miotics (142). Adjusting for time-varying exposure to other glaucoma medications, APOE, demographics, and smoking, each year of use of alpha-adrenergic agonists in an 8-year window was associated with a higher risk of developing dementia (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03-1.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with treated glaucoma, exposure to alpha-adrenergic agonists appears to be associated with risk for developing all-cause dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40108829,Accuracy of plasma biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy prior to dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteinopathy prior to the onset of dementia have significant implications for early detection.
METHODS: In 304 individuals without dementia, we investigated whether C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics' mass spectrometry (MS)-based plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta 42/40, %phosphorylated tau [p-tau]181, and %p-tau217) and amyloid probability scores (APS, PrecivityAD and APS2, PrecivityAD2) are associated with brain amyloid, brain tau, or preclinical cognitive decline.
RESULTS: In this cohort study, %p-tau217 and the APS2 had high discriminative accuracy (area under the curve > 0.93) for identifying elevated brain amyloid and tau and were associated with faster preclinical cognitive decline. Using %p-tau217 or the APS2 in a theoretical AD trial screening scenario reduced amyloid positron emission tomography imaging costs up to 41% or 45%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics' MS-based plasma biomarkers can detect brain amyloid and tau with high accuracy prior to dementia and could aid in identifying candidates for clinical trials or therapeutic intervention.
HIGHLIGHTS: C<sub>2</sub>N plasma biomarkers differentiated Alzheimer's disease proteinopathy status prior to dementia. Plasma %phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and the C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics PrecivityAD2 (APS2) were concordant with amyloid and tau positron emission tomography status. Plasma %p-tau217 and the APS2 were associated with preclinical cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39791252,Differences of longitudinal plasma biomarkers between single memory domain and multidomain subject cognitive decline: Evidence from SILCODE.,"BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers demonstrated potential in identifying amyloid pathology in early Alzheimer's disease. Different subtypes of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may lead to different cognitive impairment conversion risks.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences of plasma biomarkers in SCD subtypes individuals, which were unclear.
METHODS: The 347 individuals were involved, including 93 normal controls (NC), 76 single memory domain SCD (sd-SCD), 79 multidomain SCD (md-SCD), 55 mild cognitive impairment and 44 dementia. We investigated plasma biomarkers (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP) and neuropsychological scales in the baseline and follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were performed to investigate the risk of cognitive decline conversion. The t-test, Mann-Whitney U and multiple linear regression analysis were employed to evaluate the rate of change and correlation between PET-SUVR and plasma biomarker change.
RESULTS: In cognitively normal subjects, md-SCD exhibited lower Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> and higher p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that md-SCD group exhibited a higher risk of cognitive decline conversion compared to NC and sd-SCD. Within SCD subgroups, those with positive GFAP status showed higher conversion risk than negative. In the Cox model, the risk of conversion in the md-SCD group was 2.77 times higher than sd-SCD. The md-SCD group demonstrated a faster rate of Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> decline than sd-SCD.
CONCLUSIONS: The study utilized plasma biomarkers to highlight the significance of staging in SCD. In cognitively normal subjects, md-SCD presents a higher risk of cognitive decline than sd-SCD, providing a valuable reference and convenient tool for early identification of individuals at risk for AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40025729,Experimental basis for generating nonhuman primate models of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.,"To our knowledge, no reports have described nonhuman primate (NHP) models of frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) that do not depend on an overexpression paradigm. Based on our recent success in generating single human MAPT knock-in mouse models of FTDP-17, we describe the experimental basis for generating knock-in marmoset models of FTDP-17. In addition, successful generation of mutant PSEN1 knock-in marmoset models lacking exon 9 (PSEN1-Δ9) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates that we will be able to reconstitute two major pathological features of AD, i.e., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in an accelerated manner by combining these models.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40140365,Shared early molecular mechanisms revealed in P301S and 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early molecular events that influence disease progression. Still, the molecular mechanisms caused by different mutations of AD are not understood. We have performed a multidisciplinary study to investigate and compare the early stages of the pathology in two transgenic AD mouse models: P301S and 5xFAD. Using SNOTRAP-based mass spectrometry, we assessed changes in S-nitrosylation, a nitric oxide-mediated post-translational modification, of proteins in both models during their juvenile age. The increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine confirmed nitrosative stress in the mutant mice. Systems biology analysis revealed shared processes between the models, particularly in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission processes. In the P301S model, we identified 273 S-nitrosylated (SNOed) proteins in the cortex, with 244 proteins uniquely SNOed in the diseased mice. In the 5xFAD model, 309 SNOed proteins were identified. We have found altered proteins expression of different glutamate/GABA-related markers in the cortex and hippocampus of both AD mouse models. Additionally, the phosphorylation levels of the mTOR signaling components revealed hyperactivation of this pathway in P301S mice. Conversely, 5xFAD mice showed no significant changes in mTOR signaling except for elevated phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 in the cortex. Our findings revealed key molecular mechanisms in the two AD mouse models during their early stages. These mechanisms could serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early-stage AD.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
40156268,Multi-omics delineate growth factor network underlying exercise effects in an Alzheimer's mouse model.,"INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise is a primary defense against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We conducted single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) on the hippocampus of mice carrying mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup>) following prolonged voluntary wheel-running exercise.
RESULTS: Exercise mitigates amyloid-induced changes in transcriptome and chromatin accessibility through cell type-specific regulatory networks converging on growth factor signaling, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The beneficial effects of exercise on neurocognition can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and its downstream PI3K signaling. Exercise leads to elevated levels of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), and intranasal administration of HB-EGF enhances memory function in sedentary APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice.
DISCUSSION: These findings offer a panoramic delineation of cell type-specific hippocampal transcriptional networks activated by exercise and suggest EGFR signaling as a druggable contributor to exercise-induced memory enhancement to combat AD-related cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq analysis of APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice after prolonged wheel-running. Exercise counteracts amyloid-induced transcriptomic and accessibility changes. Networks converge on the activation of EGFR and insulin signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and PI3K blocked cognitive benefits of exercise. Intranasal HB-EGF administration enhances memory in sedentary APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39869613,Alzheimer's disease image classification based on enhanced residual attention network.,"With the increasing number of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the demand for early diagnosis and intervention is becoming increasingly urgent. The traditional detection methods for Alzheimer's disease mainly rely on clinical symptoms, biomarkers, and imaging examinations. However, these methods have limitations in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease, such as strong subjectivity in diagnostic criteria, high detection costs, and high misdiagnosis rates. To address these issues, this study proposes a deep learning model to detect Alzheimer's disease; it is called Enhanced Residual Attention Network (ERAN) that can classify medical images. By combining residual learning, attention mechanism, and soft thresholding, the feature representation ability and classification accuracy of the model have been improved. The accuracy of the model in detecting Alzheimer's disease has reached 99.36%, with a loss rate of only 0.0264. The experimental results indicate that the Enhanced Residual Attention Network has achieved excellent performance on the Alzheimer's disease test dataset, providing strong support for the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",PLoS One,2025
39936256,"Parallel changes in cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and amyloid in cognitively unimpaired older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment.","INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis centers on cognitive impairment despite other early indicators like neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. This study examined how cognition, NPS, and Aβ changes are interrelated over time in individuals without dementia.
METHODS: Participants were 1247 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 and -3 cohorts with at least 48 months of follow-up. Cognitive domains were assessed via ADNI composite measures, NPS via the neuropsychiatric inventory, and Aβ via standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) composite scores. Co-occurring changes were evaluated with parallel process models.
RESULTS: NPS was longitudinally associated with performance in each cognitive domain. Negative baseline Aβ-cognition associations were observed in three cognitive domains. No Aβ-NPS associations were observed.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated strong longitudinal relationships between NPS and cognition in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Future studies should incorporate NPS into models of disease trajectories to improve early detection and prediction of disease progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Co-occurring changes in Aβ, cognition, and neuropsychiatric symptoms are understudied. We found relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition. We found baseline, but not longitudinal, Aβ and cognition associations. Changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms should be included in early detection models of ADRD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39888600,The effect of Lewy body (co-)pathology on the clinical and imaging phenotype of amnestic patients.,"Lewy body (LB) pathology is present as a co-pathology in approximately 50% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients and may even represent the main neuropathologic substrate in a subset of patients with amnestic impairments. However, the degree to which LB pathology affects the neurodegenerative course and clinical phenotype in amnestic patients is not well understood. Recently developed α-synuclein seed amplification assays (αSyn-SAAs) provide a unique opportunity for further investigating the complex interplay between AD and LB pathology in shaping heterogeneous regional neurodegeneration patterns and clinical trajectories among amnestic patients. We studied 865 patients from the ADNI cohort with clinical diagnoses of aMCI (N=661) or AD dementia (N=211), who had CSF and FDG-PET data available. CSF samples were analyzed for peptide levels of Aβ1-42 and p-tau181, and αSyn positivity was evaluated using a novel αSyn-SAA. Based on positive/negative results on the different biomarkers, subjects were classified as ""AD-LB-"" (N=304), ""AD+LB-"" (N=335), ""AD+LB+"" (N=158) and ""AD-LB+"" (N=68). We analyzed group differences in regional FDG-PET patterns, demographics, APOE4 genotype, baseline and longitudinal domain-specific cognitive profiles (memory vs executive function/visuospatial performance), as well as risk for developing hallucinations. AD+LB+ showed worse global cognition (MMSE: p=0.005) and declined faster (p<0.001) than AD+LB-, but both groups exhibited similar memory-predominant cognitive profiles. In FDG-PET, AD+LB+ showed more severe hypometabolism compared to AD+LB-, but both groups were characterized by largely identical patterns of temporo-parietal hypometabolism. By contrast, AD-LB+ were less globally impaired (p<0.001) but characterized by a markedly more dysexecutive and visuospatial profile (p<0.003) and a strikingly different posterior-occipital pattern of hypometabolism. APOE4 positivity was similar between AD+LB+ and AD+LB- (72% vs. 75%, p=0.28) but lower in AD-LB+ (28%, p<0.001). On a group level, AD+LB+, AD+LB-, and AD-LB+ showed similar risks of developing hallucinations, but patients with a LB-like posterior-occipital hypometabolism pattern had a significantly higher risk compared to those showing an AD-typical temporo-parietal pattern (HR=2.58, p=0.004). In conclusion, LB co-pathology in AD was associated with more severe hypometabolism and faster cognitive decline, but did not affect the regional hypometabolic pattern or cognitive profile. By contrast, patients with relatively pure LB pathology showed a more executive/visuospatial-predominant cognitive profile and a distinct posterior-occipital hypometabolism pattern characteristic for LB disease. These findings indicate that the presence of LB pathology may have different consequences for the clinical phenotype depending on AD co-morbidity, which may have critical implications for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with amnestic syndromes.",Brain,2025
40193949,Clinical and Analytical Performance of DuritectTM: A Novel Blood-Based Autoantibody Diagnostic Sceening Platform for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases (P10-3.009).,"OBJECTIVE: In the present study we demonstrate the clinical and analytical utility of the Duritect™ platform, a diagnostic screening solution comprised of panels of customized blood-based autoantibody biomarkers capable of detecting disease-related processes resulting from ongoing Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease pathology, using a proprietary risk score capable of predicting an individual's likelihood of developing AD or PD in the future.
BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to identify blood-based biomarkers that can accurately diagnose AD and PD in the earliest stages of disease pathology.
DESIGN/METHODS: Utilizing Duritect™'s autoantibody biomarker panels and Luminex xMAP® technology, blinded sera samples from ADNI subjects with confirmed presymptomatic, prodromal (MCI), and mild-moderate AD, as well as early-stage PD subjects (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-2.5) from various sources, together with healthy age- and-sex-matched control subjects were screened to detect the presence of AD or PD-related pathology. Autoantibody levels were evaluated using a proprietary machine learning algorithm to calculate an individual Disease Risk Score (DRS) for each patient sample, indicating whether that individual has a typical, or increased risk of ongoing AD or PD pathology.
RESULTS: Results demonstrate that Duritect™'s disease-specific panels of autoantibody biomarkers corresponding to a patient's AD or PD risk score successfully differentiated both AD and PD subjects from age- and sex-matched controls, demonstrating greater than 90% overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in both diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Duritect™ is the first blood-based autoantibody diagnostic platform for the detection of neurodegenerative diseases. CLIA validated tests against AD or PD-related pathology in patients presenting in primary care settings with signs or symptoms for suspected Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are already on the market. Duritect™ is an accurate, minimally invasive, and inexpensive diagnostic screener, for the detection of early, AD-related pathology associated with prodromal (MCI) and later stages of AD, as well as early-stage PD-related pathology.

39703327,Divergent neurodegenerative patterns: Comparison of [<sup>18</sup>F] fluorodeoxyglucose-PET- and MRI-based Alzheimer's disease subtypes.,"[<sup>18</sup>F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and MRI are key imaging markers for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. It has been well established that parieto-temporal hypometabolism on FDG-PET is closely associated with medial temporal atrophy on MRI in Alzheimer's disease. Substantial biological heterogeneity, expressed as distinct subtypes of hypometabolism or atrophy patterns, has been previously described in Alzheimer's disease using data-driven and hypothesis-driven methods. However, the link between these two imaging modalities has not yet been explored in the context of Alzheimer's disease subtypes. To investigate this link, the current study utilized FDG-PET and MRI scans from 180 amyloid-beta positive Alzheimer's disease dementia patients, 339 amyloid-beta positive mild cognitive impairment and 176 amyloid-beta negative cognitively normal controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Random forest hierarchical clustering, a data-driven model for identifying subtypes, was implemented in the two modalities: one with standard uptake value ratios and the other with grey matter volumes. Five hypometabolism- and atrophy-based subtypes were identified, exhibiting both cortical-predominant and limbic-predominant patterns although with differing percentages and clinical presentations. Three cortical-predominant hypometabolism subtypes found were Cortical Predominant (32%), Cortical Predominant+ (11%) and Cortical Predominant posterior (8%), and two limbic-predominant hypometabolism subtypes found were Limbic Predominant (36%) and Limbic Predominant frontal (13%). In addition, little atrophy (minimal) and widespread (diffuse) neurodegeneration subtypes were observed from the MRI data. The five atrophy subtypes found were Cortical Predominant (19%), Limbic Predominant (27%), Diffuse (29%), Diffuse+ (6%) and Minimal (19%). Inter-modality comparisons showed that all FDG-PET subtypes displayed medial temporal atrophy, whereas the distinct MRI subtypes showed topographically similar hypometabolic patterns. Further, allocations of FDG-PET and MRI subtypes were not consistent when compared at an individual level. Additional analysis comparing the data-driven clustering model with prior hypothesis-driven methods showed only partial agreement between these subtyping methods. FDG-PET subtypes had greater differences between limbic-predominant and cortical-predominant patterns, and MRI subtypes had greater differences in severity of atrophy. In conclusion, this study highlighted that Alzheimer's disease subtypes identified using both FDG-PET and MRI capture distinct pathways showing cortical versus limbic predominance of neurodegeneration. However, the subtypes do not share a bidirectional relationship between modalities and are thus not interchangeable.",Brain Commun,2024
40095666,The neuropathologic basis for translational biomarker development in the macaque model of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAccurate placement of the macaque within the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research framework is essential to discover early-stage predictive biomarkers.ObjectiveTo assess utility of the aging macaque in advancing translational biomarker development for preclinical AD, we evaluated relative signal strength of comparable neuropathologic phenomena in macaques and patients.MethodsWe compared pathology in patient and macaque formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues using identical criteria. We quantified expression of amyloid-β (Aβ), pTau, and inflammatory and senescence markers across species. Distribution of AD-relevant markers were compared in FFPE and perfused frozen macaque brain to assess expression of labile proteins that could inform in-life fluid biomarkers.ResultsAβ pathology in macaques closely approximated patient pathology. Complex plaque composition in macaques implied significant disruption of synaptic connectivity. In FFPE tissue, pretangle pTau immunoreactivity placed the macaque in Braak Stage 1b. In perfused frozen tissue, soluble pTau distribution approximated Braak Stage III-IV. In macaque, Aβ, pTau, and acetylcholinesterase labeling co-localized to AD-vulnerable circuits. Significant association of glial fibrillary acidic protein with Aβ occurred in humans only. The senescence marker p16 correlated positively with pTau expression and negatively with Aβ in patients only. Macaques lacked neuropathologic co-morbidities.ConclusionsAD-relevant neuropathologic signals in the macaque support biomarker discovery in the areas of Aβ plaque evolution and associated synaptic disruption as well as early-stage tau phosphorylation. Relative protection from accumulation of senescence markers, fibrillar tau and neuropathologic co-morbidities in macaque implicate species difference in rates of biological brain aging. We provide over 4000 digital slides for further study.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39766416,Effects of Route Complexity and Lighting on Route Following in Alzheimer's Disease and Posterior Cortical Atrophy.,"OBJECTIVE: Visual processing deficits arising in dementia are associated with particular functional disability. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mobility and navigation in people with dementia-related visual loss.
METHODS: Participants with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; ""visual-variant Alzheimer's""; n = 11), typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD; N = 10), and controls (n = 13) repeatedly walked down routes within a simplified real-world setting. Participant groups were of comparable age and gender. Routes were of different complexity (straight, U-shaped, and S-shaped), overhead lighting levels (low and high) and with or without a dynamic LED (light-emitting diode) cue (trial n = 24). Ratios of walking times for each experimental condition (each complex route vs the straight route, high lighting vs low, and LED cue vs no cue) were compared between participant groups. Kinematic measures were produced from a total of 10,813 steps using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs).
RESULTS: The walking time ratios relating to route complexity were higher in the PCA group than in controls: 30.3% (95% CI [13.5%, 49.5%] higher for U-shaped vs straight and 31.9% [21.1%, 55.3%] for S-shaped vs straight, averaged over other conditions). The analogous results relating to route complexity for the tAD group were intermediate between those for the PCA and control groups. There was no evidence that walking time ratios differed according to lighting level or the presence of the LED cue.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings contribute to evidence-based design for dementia-friendly environments, emphasizing consequences of environmental complexity for functional independence and mobility in people with dementia-related visual loss. Findings inform recommendations for environmental design to support the independence of individuals with dementia.",Brain Sci,2024
40189783,"The striatum is an early, accurate indicator of amyloid burden using [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB in Down syndrome: Comparison of two radiotracers.","INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome demonstrate striatum-first amyloid accumulation with [<sup>11</sup>C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which has not been replicated with [<sup>18</sup>F]florbetapir (FBP). Early striatal accumulation has not been temporally quantified with respect to global cortical measures.
METHODS: Longitudinal PiB (n = 175 participants) and FBP (n = 92 participants) data from the Alzheimer Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) were used to measure cortical and striatal binding. Generalized temporal models for cortical and striatal amyloid accumulation were created using the sampled iterative local approximation (SILA) method.
RESULTS: PiB demonstrated greater striatal-to-cortical ratios than FBP. SILA analysis revealed striatal amyloid burden occurs 3.40 (2.39) years earlier than the cortex in PiB. There was no difference between the cortex and striatum in FBP.
DISCUSSION: Among adults with Down syndrome, the striatum consistently accumulates amyloid earlier than the cortex when measured with PiB. This suggests the striatum is more sensitive to the onset of PiB PET-detectable amyloid in Down syndrome.
HIGHLIGHTS: Striatal amyloid is detectable 3.4 years before the cortex using PiB PET in DS. Florbetapir PET does not detect early striatal amyloid accumulation in DS. White matter can be used as reference region in longitudinal florbetapir PET. SILA trajectory models can be used to compare regional estimates for age of onset.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39794837,Association and multimodal model of retinal and blood-based biomarkers for detection of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The potential diagnostic value of plasma amyloidogenic beta residue 42/40 ratio (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), neurofilament light (NfL), tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau181), and threonine-217 (p-tau217) has been extensively discussed in the literature. We have also previously described the association between retinal biomarkers and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to evaluate the association, and a multimodal model of, retinal and plasma biomarkers for detection of preclinical AD.
METHODS: We included 82 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants (141 eyes; mean age: 67 years; range: 56-80) from the Atlas of Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer's Study (ARIAS). Blood samples were assessed for concentrations of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, NfL, p-tau181, and p-tau217 (ALZpath, Inc.) using Single molecule array (SIMOA) technology. The Spectralis II system (Heidelberg Engineering) was used to acquire macular centered Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images for evaluation of putative retinal gliosis surface area and macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL) thickness. For all participants, correlations (adjusted for age and correlation between eyes) were assessed between retinal and blood-based biomarkers. A subgroup cohort of 57 eyes from 32 participants with recent Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) results, comprising 18 preclinical patients (Aβ PET + ve, 32 eyes) and 14 controls (Aβ PET -ve, 25 eyes) with a mean age of 69 vs. 66, p = 0.06, was included for the assessment of a multimodal model to distinguish between the two groups. For this subgroup cohort, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the multimodal model of retinal and plasma biomarkers vs. each biomarker alone to distinguish between the two groups.
RESULTS: Significant correlation was found between putative retinal gliosis and p-tau217 in the univariate mixed model (β = 0.48, p = 0.007) but not for the other plasma biomarkers (p > 0.05). This positive correlation was also retained in the multivariate mixed model (β = 0.43, p = 0.022). The multimodal ROC model based on retinal (gliosis area, inner inferior RNFL thickness, inner superior RNFL thickness, and inner nasal RNFL thickness) and plasma biomarkers (p-tau217 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio) had an excellent AUC of 0.97 (95% CI = 0.93-1.01; p < 0.001) compared to unimodal models of retinal and plasma biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses show the potential of integrating retinal and blood-based biomarkers for improved detection and screening of preclinical AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39791247,Urinary formic acid is associated with cerebral amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism in memory clinic patients.,"BACKGROUND: Urinary formic acid (FA) has been reported to be a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between FA and pathological changes in memory clinic patients is currently unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate associations between FA and pathological changes across different cognitive statuses in memory clinic patients.
METHODS: A cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-Aβ- n = 37, MCI-Aβ+ n = 33), AD dementia (n = 39), and cognitively normal subjects (CN-Aβ- n = 98, CN-Aβ+ n = 50) were included. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, urinary FA, AD-related plasma biomarkers, MRI scans, [<sup>18</sup>F]-flurbetapir and [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG PET scan data were collected from all participants.
RESULTS: Urinary FA levels were higher in patients with MCI and AD than in CN subjects and higher in Aβ+ (CN- Aβ+, MCI-Aβ+, AD dementia) subjects than in Aβ-subjects (CN- Aβ-, MCI-Aβ-). Urinary FA was positively associated with cerebral Aβ deposition and negatively associated with glucose metabolism, both at the global level and in multiple regions of interest cortical regions in participants with different cognitive statuses. Additionally, urinary FA levels were positively correlated with the severity of white matter hyperintensities and hippocampal atrophy. Urinary FA combined with age, Mini-Mental State Examination, plasma p-tau181, and neuroﬁlament light chain could be used to predict Aβ deposition in the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary FA is associated with brain pathological changes in memory clinic patients, including cerebral Aβ deposition, glucose metabolism, white matter hyperintensities, and hippocampal atrophy. It could be used as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD and predicting Aβ deposition.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39686606,Differences in lean mass and sarcopenia between individuals with Alzheimer's disease and those without dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have observed that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) tend to have lower lean mass and higher rates of sarcopenia.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to assess differences in lean mass, sarcopenia, and its components between individuals with AD and those without dementia (WD).
METHODS: Searches were conducted in the Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and Latin American and Caribbean Health Scientific Literature. Observational studies comparing lean mass, sarcopenia, and its components in the populations of interest were included. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale to assess methodological quality. Mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences were calculated for the meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Four studies with 2035 individuals found that those with AD had significantly lower upper and lower limb lean mass, and skeletal muscle mass index compared to WD individuals. AD individuals also had a higher sarcopenia prevalence (41.33% versus 20.66%) and significant reductions in handgrip strength, lower limb muscle strength, and gait speed compared to WD individuals. The JBI scale analysis showed high agreement among the studies (k = 1.00, p = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with AD have lower lean mass, higher rates of sarcopenia, and reduced muscle function compared to those without dementia. While the results suggest the need for early screening programs and integrated therapeutic interventions to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for individuals with AD, it is important to consider that biases inherent in observational studies may compromise the quality of the evidence. Therefore, further research, preferably clinical trials, is needed to confirm these associations.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40044663,Phosphorylated tau 181 and 217 are elevated in serum and muscle of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Blood phosphorylated (p)-tau 181 and p-tau 217 have been proposed as accurate biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, blood p-tau 181 is also elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without a clearly identified source. We measured serum p-tau 181 and p-tau 217 in a multicentre cohort of ALS (n = 152), AD (n = 111) cases and disease controls (n = 99) recruited from four different centres. Further, we investigated the existence of both p-tau species using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mass spectrometry (MS) in muscle biopsies of ALS cases (IHC: n = 13, MS: n = 5) and disease controls (IHC: n = 14, MS: n = 5) from one cohort. Serum p-tau 181 and p-tau 217 were higher in AD and ALS patients compared to disease controls. IHC and MS analyses revealed the presence of p-tau 181 and 217 in muscle biopsies from both ALS cases and disease controls, with ALS samples showing increased p-tau reactivity in atrophic muscle fibres. Blood p-tau species could potentially be used to diagnose both ALS and AD.",Nat Commun,2025
39772842,Perceptions about preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarker collection procedure influences willingness to participate: Findings from an ethnoracially diverse study.,"BACKGROUND: Past research suggests that ethnoracialized groups differ in their willingness to engage in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) research overall. Studies indicated that participation willingness was affected by attitudes toward research and perceived invasiveness of biomarker collection techniques. However, comparative quantitative studies are few, and minoritized groups are under-included.
OBJECTIVE: In a cross-sectional online survey, we sought to explore community-based adults' willingness to engage in preclinical AD biomarker testing, comparing their attitudes about research and different types of biomarker procedures.
METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a diverse group of participants. African American (AA), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Latinx (LTX), and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults aged 26-90 were asked about their research attitudes, biomarkers, and willingness to participate in specific biomarker test procedures (i.e., brain imaging via PET scanning, blood draws, and cerebrospinal fluid collection by lumbar puncture). We also assessed participants' perceived safety, burden, and distress for each of the three biomarker collection methods. To understand the association between research willingness and ethnoracial identity, we ran linear regression models for each procedure, adjusting for age, gender, educational attainment, and attitudes toward research.
RESULTS: The AA group expressed greater willingness to engage in biomarker testing involving blood draws than the NHW group. The AI/AN group was significantly less willing to undergo lumbar puncture than the NHW group; this difference remained after adjusting for various sociodemographic factors and research attitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Respondents' willingness to engage in preclinical AD biomarker research was affected by their perceptions about the testing collection procedure.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39737719,Forty-hertz sensory entrainment impedes kindling epileptogenesis and reduces amyloid pathology in an Alzheimer disease mouse model.,"OBJECTIVE: The 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) recapitulates amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and pronounced seizure susceptibility observed in patients with AD. Forty-hertz audiovisual stimulation is a noninvasive technique that entrains gamma neural oscillations and can reduce Aβ pathology and modulate glial expression in AD models. We hypothesized that 40-Hz sensory stimulation would improve seizure susceptibility in 5xFAD mice and this would be associated with reduction of plaques and modulation of glial phenotypes.
METHODS: 5xFAD mice and wild-type (WT) littermates received 1 h/day 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation or sham (n = 7-11/group), beginning 2 weeks before and continuing throughout amygdala kindling epileptogenesis. Postmortem analyses included Aβ pathology and morphology of astrocytes and microglia.
RESULTS: 5xFAD mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to seizures compared to WT, evidenced by fewer stimulations to reach kindling endpoint (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.46, p < .0001) and a trend to higher seizure severity (odds ratio [OR] = .34, p = .059). Forty-hertz stimulation reduced the behavioral severity of the first seizure (OR = 4.04, p = .02) and delayed epileptogenesis, increasing the number of stimulations required to reach kindling endpoint (IRR = .82, p = .01) compared to sham, regardless of genotype. 5xFAD mice receiving sensory stimulation exhibited ~50% reduction in amyloid pathology compared to sham. Furthermore, markers of astrocytes and microglia were upregulated in both genotypes receiving 40-Hz stimulation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Forty-hertz sensory entrainment slows epileptogenesis in the mouse amygdala kindling model. Although this intervention improves Aβ pathology in 5xFAD mice, the observed antiepileptogenic effect may also relate to effects on glia, because mice without Aβ plaques (i.e., WT) also experienced antiepileptogenic effects of the intervention.",Epilepsia,2025

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) α4β2* subtype, was studied in this mouse model using [<sup>18</sup>F]nifene PET/CT and compared with non-transgenic B6129SF2/J mice (male and female). Young 2-month old B6129SF2/J exhibited normal [<sup>18</sup>F]nifene distribution (measured as standard uptake volume ratios, SUVR with cerebellum as reference) thalamus (TH) 3.12&gt; medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 2.33&gt; frontal cortex (FC) 2.06&gt; hippocampus-subiculum (HP-SUB) 1.6. At 11-months of age, B6129SF2/J exhibited high, irreversible and non-saturable [<sup>18</sup>F]nifene binding in mPFC higher than in TH (mPFC 3.8&gt; TH 2.82&gt; FC 1.79&gt; HP-SUB 1.73). The 3xTg-AD also exhibited high mPFC binding, although the region of highest binding within the mPFC was different compared to B6129SF2/J mice (mPFC 2.44&gt; TH 2.27&gt; FC 1.61&gt; HP-SUB 1.48). [<sup>125</sup>I]IBETA and immunohistochemistry in 3xTg-AD brain slices confirmed Aβ plaques. The TH of 3xTg-AD mice had lower [<sup>18</sup>F]nifene binding (reduced by approximately 20 %) compared to both, young and old B6129SF2/J, and was significant. The mPFC [<sup>18</sup>F]nifene binding was significantly higher in the old B6129SF2/J compared to both the young B6129SF2/J and the 3xTg-AD mice (&gt;150 %). Overall, 3xTg-AD transgenic mice had reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]nifene binding compared to B6129SF2/J controls, suggesting possible effects of Aβ plaques and Tau on α4β2* nAChRs.",Neuroimage,2025
39876821,"Iron-associated lipid peroxidation in Alzheimer's disease is increased in lipid rafts with decreased ferroptosis suppressors, tested by chelation in mice.","INTRODUCTION: Iron-mediated cell death (ferroptosis) is a proposed mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. While iron is essential for basic biological functions, its reactivity generates oxidants which contribute to cell damage and death.
METHODS: To further resolve mechanisms of iron-mediated toxicity in AD, we analyzed post mortem human brain and ApoEFAD mice.
RESULTS: AD brains had decreased antioxidant enzymes, including those mediated by glutathione (GSH). Subcellular analyses of AD brains showed greater oxidative damage and lower antioxidant enzymes in lipid rafts, the site of amyloid processing, than in the non-raft membrane fraction. Apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers had lower lipid raft yield with greater membrane oxidation. The hypothesized role of iron in AD pathology was tested in ApoEFAD mice by iron chelation with deferoxamine, which decreased fibrillar amyloid and lipid peroxidation, together with increased GSH-mediated antioxidants.
DISCUSSION: These novel molecular pathways highlight iron-mediated damage to lipid rafts during AD.
HIGHLGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains have numerous markers for ferroptosis, including increased lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant levels, and increased iron storage. Lipid rafts in AD cases have increased oxidative damage and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and activity which are most severe in apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers. Neuronal markers are correlated with lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defense, and iron signaling proteins suggesting that neuronal loss is linked to these events. Chelation of iron in the early-onset familial AD model reduces iron-mediated lipid peroxidation and fibrillar amyloid.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39726764,Postural imbalance without visual input is associated with specific neuropsychological deficits in older adults - results from the LIFE-adult study.,"INTRODUCTION: Modifiable risk factors play an important role in preventing dementia and reducing its progression. Regular physical activity already in midlife, which relies on intact multisensory balance control, can help to decrease the risk of dementia. However, our understanding of the relationship between postural balance and cognitive functions remains limited. The objective of our study was to investigate the association of postural balance during different sensory conditions with specific cognitive domains in older adults.
METHODS: Participants were from the population-based prospective ""Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases"" (LIFE-Adult) cohort in Leipzig, Germany. Executive, memory and processing speed functions were tested by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) plus battery. Assessment of visuospatial abilities was based on the short form of the Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLO). Postural sway was recorded on a force plate with eyes open and closed. Romberg's ratios were calculated for sway path and sway area as a proxy for balance without visual control and tested in generalized linear regression models with the summary scores of executive function, memory, processing speed and visuospatial function as dependent variables. All models were adjusted for sex, age, ApoE status, socioeconomic status, anamnestic stroke, and diabetes.
RESULTS: In total, we analyzed 460 participants with a mean age of 68.6 years, range 60 to 80, 47.6% female. A higher Romberg's ratio for sway area was a significant indicator for impaired visuospatial abilities as measured by the dichotomized JLO (Odds Ratio = 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.88). Romberg's ratios were not significantly associated with executive functions, procedural speed or memory functions.
DISCUSSION: It may be worthwhile to examine in the future whether inclusion of balance testing enhances the value of screening programs for cognitive impairment. Inversely, it may be appropriate to apply routine cognitive tests when balance problems are detected in older patients.",Front Neurol,2024
40065917,Broad repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus in Alzheimer's disease: A rationale and study design.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process.
METHODS: We will conduct a two-stage trial of large-coil rTMS targeting the precuneus (a key hub in the DMN affected by AD) in 54 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome focused primarily on determining tolerability and feasibility and secondarily focused on determining short-term efficacy for memory. The first stage will involve 5 to 10 participants receiving open-label active treatment to refine the protocol. The following second stage will consist of a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to study feasibility and tolerability while exploring target engagement and short-term efficacy for memory. Participants will undergo 16 total rTMS brain stimulation sessions over the course of 5 weeks. A full course of open-label active treatment will be offered as an extension to the sham group after unblinding. Outcomes will focus on completion rates and adverse events to demonstrate feasibility and tolerability. Further exploratory outcomes will include neuropsychological assessments, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers to demonstrate the feasibility of collection and explore preliminary changes in these measures.
RESULTS: We anticipate this treatment is feasible and tolerable and may show evidence of target engagement and clinical improvement.
DISCUSSION: Should we achieve expected positive outcomes in feasibility and tolerability, this will justify future work focusing on clear demonstrations of clinical efficacy and biomarker engagement, as well as enhancement of generalizability and scalability.
HIGHLIGHTS: Induction-to-maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though recent methods require intensive personalization.We propose here a trial design of precuneus rTMS in mild-to-early-moderate AD dementia using exclusively off-the-shelf equipment and protocol modifications to reduce participant burden.Our two novel modifications from prior work are (1) using a larger rTMS coil, and (2) consolidating the induction phase of treatment.This trial focuses primarily on tolerability and feasibility while exploring clinical measures of efficacy and biomarkers of target engagement.Our trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06597942.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39695808,Microglial CD2AP deficiency exerts protection in an Alzheimer's disease model of amyloidosis.,"BACKGROUND: The CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was initially identified in peripheral immune cells and regulates cytoskeleton and protein trafficking. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD2AP gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functional role of CD2AP, especially its role in microglia during AD onset, remains elusive.
METHODS: CD2AP protein levels in cultured primary cells and in 5xFAD mice was studied. Microglial CD2AP-deficient mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice and the offspring were subjected to neuropathological assessment, behavioral tests, electrophysiology, RNA-seq, Golgi staining, and biochemistry analysis. Primary microglia were also isolated for assessing their uptake and morphology changes.
RESULTS: We find that CD2AP is abundantly expressed in microglia and its levels are elevated in the brain of AD patients and the 5xFAD model mice at pathological stages. We demonstrate that CD2AP haploinsufficiency in microglia significantly attenuates cognitive and synaptic deficits, weakens the response of microglia to Aβ and the formation of disease-associated microglia (DAM), and alleviates synapse loss in 5xFAD mice. We show that CD2AP-deficient microglia exhibit compromised uptake ability. In addition, we find that CD2AP expression is positively correlated with the expression of the complement C1q that is important for synapse phagocytosis and the formation of DAM in response to Aβ deposition. Moreover, we reveal that CD2AP interacts with colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and regulates CSF1R cell surface levels, which may further affect C1q expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CD2AP regulates microgliosis and identify a protective function of microglial CD2AP deficiency against Aβ deposition, suggesting the importance of detailed investigation of AD-associated genes in different brain cells for thoroughly understanding their exact contribution to AD.",Mol Neurodegener,2024
39954093,Microglia aggregates define distinct immune and neurodegenerative niches in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia form distinct cellular aggregates that play critical roles in disease progression, including Aβ plaque-associated microglia (PaM) and the newly identified coffin-like microglia (CoM). PaM are closely associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, while CoM are enriched in the pyramidal layer of the CA2/CA1 hippocampal subfields, where they frequently engulf neurons and associate with tau-positive tangles and phosphorylated α-synuclein. To elucidate the role of these microglial subtypes, we employed high-content neuropathology, integrating Deep Spatial Profiling (DSP), multiplex chromogenic immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, to comprehensively map and characterise their morphological and molecular signatures, as well as their neuropathological and astrocytic microenvironments, in AD and control post-mortem samples. PaM and PaM-associated astrocytes exhibited signatures related to complement system pathways, ErbB signalling, and metabolic and neurodegenerative processes. In contrast, CoM displayed markers associated with protein degradation and immune signalling pathways, including STING, TGF-β, and NF-κB. While no direct association between CD8 + T cells and either microglial type was observed, CD163 + perivascular macrophages were frequently incorporated into PaM. These findings provide novel insights into the heterogeneity of microglial responses, in particular their distinct interactions with astrocytes and infiltrating immune cells, and shed light on specific neurodegenerative hotspots and their implications for hippocampal deterioration in AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2025
40110607,"Dementia in a resource-constrained sub-Saharan African setting: A comprehensive retrospective analysis of prevalence, risk factors, and management at the only neuropsychiatric facility in Northeastern Nigeria.","INTRODUCTION: Dementia prevalence is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially due to population growth and aging. Resource-constrained settings such as Northeastern Nigeria face challenges in dementia management.
METHODS: We assessed dementia burden and management at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Maiduguri, the only neuropsychiatric facility in Northeastern Nigeria. This retrospective analysis included patient records from 1999 to 2023 for individuals 60 year of age and older with a dementia diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 1216 cases reported, Alzheimer's disease (60.5%) was the most common subtype, followed by vascular dementia (24.5%). Hypertension (41.6%) was the most frequent comorbidity. Memory loss was present in all cases, whereas behavioral symptoms like agitation presented in some cases. Treatments included cognitive enhancers (donepezil), supplements (gingko biloba), and non-drug therapies (psychoeducation).
DISCUSSION: The increasing burden of dementia at this sole facility highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions and further research to understand the underlying factors contributing to dementia in this population.
HIGHLIGHTS: Dementia trends and management in a neuropsychiatric facility serving over 26 million people in Northeastern Nigeria. Alzheimer's disease accounted for 60.5% of the dementia cases reported, with hypertension as the leading comorbidity. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tools and health care infrastructure to address dementia in resource-constrained settings. The findings lay the foundation for developing a dementia cohort as part of the Northern Nigeria Dementia Research Group.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39893485,Delta-opioid receptor signaling alleviates neuropathology and cognitive impairment in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by regulating microglia homeostasis and inhibiting HMGB1 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that opioid receptor signaling may differentially affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and the relevant behavioral dysfunctions. However, the precise roles and mechanisms of opioid receptor subtypes in AD pathologies are still unclear with major controversies.
METHODS: We compared the delta-opioid receptor (DOR)- and mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated effects on AD-associated cognitive deficits, pathologies, neuroinflammations, cell death using transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model and BV2 cell line at behavioral, molecular, and cellular levels. Unpaired t-test and one/two way analysis for variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze statistical significance of the data.
RESULTS: We show a distinct role of DOR and its major difference with MOR in AD injury in an APP/PS1 mouse model. DOR activation by UFP-512, but not MOR activation by DAMGO, attenuated cognitive impairment, reduced beta-amyloid (Aβ) production and aggregation, as well as protected the neurons from apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice. DOR and MOR also differentially modulated microglia in APP/PS1 mice and in vitro AD cell model with a DOR-mediated inhibition on the excessive activation of microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in AD pathologies. Gene expression profiling further revealed that the alternations in DOR/MOR are closely associated with microglial homeostatic signatures and high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) in AD. DOR activation inhibited HMGB1 secretion and its translocation from nuclear to cytoplasm. Our in-vitro studies further confirmed that DOR overexpression mitigated microglial inflammatory response and rescued neurons from AD injury via HMGB1-NF-κB signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings uncover previously unappreciated roles of DOR in neuroprotection against AD injury via modulating microglia-related inflammatory responses.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39853302,EpiAge: a next-generation sequencing-based ELOVL2 epigenetic clock for biological age assessment in saliva and blood across health and disease.,"This study introduces EpiAgePublic, a new method to estimate biological age using only three specific sites on the gene ELOVL2, known for its connection to aging. Unlike traditional methods that require complex and extensive data, our model uses a simpler approach that is well-suited for next-generation sequencing technology, which is a more advanced method of analyzing DNA methylation. This new model overcomes some of the common challenges found in older methods, such as errors due to sample quality and processing variations. We tested EpiAgePublic with a large and varied group of over 4,600 people to ensure its accuracy. It performed on par with, and sometimes better than, more complicated models that use much more data for age estimation. We examined its effectiveness in understanding how factors like HIV infection and stress affect aging, confirming its usefulness in real-world clinical settings. Our results prove that our simple yet effective model, EpiAgePublic, can capture the subtle signs of aging with high accuracy. We also used this model in a study involving patients with Alzheimer's Disease, demonstrating the practical benefits of next-generation sequencing in making precise age-related assessments. This study lays the groundwork for future research on aging mechanisms and assessing how different interventions might impact the aging process using this clock.",Aging (Albany NY),2025
39751702,"The Interplay Between Accumulation of Amyloid-Beta and Tau Proteins, PANoptosis, and Inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and the vast majority of cases occur in elderly patients. Recently, the accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins has drawn considerable attention in AD research. This review explores the multifaceted interactions between these proteins and their contribution to the pathological landscape of AD, encompassing synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a collective term for programmed cell death (PCD) modalities that encompass elements of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. The accumulation of Aβ peptides and tau proteins, along with the immune response in brain cells, may trigger PANoptosis, thus advancing the progression of the disease. Recent advancements in molecular imaging and genetics have provided deeper insights into the interactions between Aβ peptides, tau proteins, and the immune response. The review also discusses the role of mitochondrial dysregulation in AD. The exploration of the interplay between neurodegeneration, immune responses, and cell death offers promising avenues for the development of innovative treatments.",Neuromolecular Med,2024
39924519,Small-world networks propensity in spontaneous speech signals of Alzheimer's disease: visibility graph analysis.,"Exploiting complex network methods to describe dynamical behavior based on speech time series can provide fundamental insights into the function of underlying dynamical processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study scrutinizes the dynamic alterations in Alzheimer's speech through abstract concepts of small-world networks. The visibility graph (VG) of the time series of spontaneous speech is introduced as a quantitative method to differentiate between healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's. The dynamic speech patterns across three AD and healthy subjects stages are analyzed by examining the small-world feature structure, characterized by a high clustering coefficient (C) and short average path length (L) in the VG. These characteristics are calculated based on degree K. The results demonstrate the practical utility of C and L in identifying the underlying pathological mechanisms of AD. Furthermore, all speech series exhibit small-world topology based on VG, with changes reflecting the brain system's pathology that impacts individuals' language skills.",Sci Rep,2025
39717698,"Open label pilot of personalized, neuroimaging-guided theta burst stimulation in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and disruption of large-scale brain networks (LSBNs). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a potential non-invasive AD treatment that may serve as an adjunct therapy with FDA approved medications.
METHODS: We conducted a 10-subject open label, single site study evaluating the effect of functional connectivity-resting state functional MRI guided-approach to TMS targeting with dysfunctional LSBNs in subjects with biomarker-confirmed early-stage AD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05292222). Subjects underwent pre-post imaging and testing to assess connectivity dysfunction and cognition. All participants received intermittent theta burst stimulation [(iTBS), (80% motor threshold; 5 sessions per day; 5 days; 3 targets; 18,000 pulses/day)] over 2 weeks. Three Human Connectome Project (HCP) defined parcellations were targeted, with one common right temporal area G dorsal (RTGd) target across all subjects and two personalized.
RESULTS: We identified the following parcellations to be dysfunctional: RTGd, left area 8A ventral (L8Av), left area 8B lateral (L8BL), and left area 55b (L55b). There were no changes in these parcellations after treatment, but subjects showed improvement on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status attention index (9.7; p = 0.01). No subject dropped out of the treatment, though 3 participants were unable to tolerate the RTGd target due to facial twitching (n = 2) and anxiety (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: Accelerated iTBS protocol was well-tolerated and personalized target-based treatment is feasible in early-stage AD. Further sham-controlled clinical trials are necessary to determine if this is an effective adjunctive treatment in early-stage AD.",Front Neurosci,2024
39744522,Modifying reaction time tasks parameters in the automated IntelliCage identifies heightened impulsivity and impaired attention in the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The 3xTg-AD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important tool to investigate the relationship between development of pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Traditional behavioral tasks assessing aspects of learning and memory, such as mazes requiring spatial navigation, unfortunately suffer from several shortcomings, including the stress of human handling and not probing species-typical behavior. The automated IntelliCage system was developed to circumvent such issues by testing mice in a social environment while measuring multiple aspects of cognition. Water consumption can serve as a primary motivator for task engagement. Once animals adapt to the cage and can access water, mice can be subjected to operant tasks. Each of the four corners of a cage contains doors to manipulate access to water, visual LED cues, and a valve allowing administration of an air puff. Previously, we detected significant impairments in 3xTg-AD mice in the IntelliCage, however a high failure rate and genotypical differences in water motivation were observed.
METHODS: Here, we implemented an IntelliCage paradigm where mice underwent progressively more difficult reaction time tasks to assess attention and impulsivity, behaviors mediated by the prefrontal cortex. Mice were placed in the IntelliCage at 11.5 months of age, which corresponds with the presence of widespread pathology.
RESULTS: As the difficulty of the reaction time tasks increased, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited lower percent Correct Responses than NonTg. When implementing varying pre-cue durations, where animals are required to wait between the initiation of the trial and the LED turning on (which then requires a nose-poke to access water), 3xTg-AD mice prematurely nose-poked on trials requiring a longer delay before a second nose poke would allow water access, demonstrating heightened impulsivity. The presence of soluble and insoluble fractions of cortical Aβ40 and 42, and phosphorylated tau epitopes threonine 181 and serine 396 confirmed the presence of neuropathological hallmarks in 3xTg-AD mice.
CONCLUSION: Together, this study describes a novel protocol that overcomes motivational differences and detects attention and impulsivity deficits in 3xTg-AD mice utilizing the IntelliCage.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40172817,Neuroprotective Effects of Catechins by Differentially Affecting the Binding of Beta-amyloid and Its Aggregates to the Target Cells.,"Aggregation and deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ42) in extracellular spaces are key neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extracellular Aβ42 aggregates not only impair the function of the extracellular matrix but also directly damage brain cells through binding interactions. Chemically, tea polyphenols are amphiphilic, similar to the Aβ42 molecule. This study found that catechin (CA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) effectively bound to Aβ42 monomers (Aβ42M) and oligomers (Aβ42O), preventing Aβ42 aggregation; in contrast, EGCG also showed some binding to protofibrils (Aβ42P) and fibrils (Aβ42F), slightly inhibiting their development. In the presence of Aβ42M and Aβ42 aggregates in vitro, CA and EGCG demonstrated considerable protective effects on neural and vascular endothelial cells. These effects corresponded with the ability of CA and EGCG (particularly CA) to preserve Aβ42M's targeting and binding to these cells, while they (especially EGCG) blocked or inhibited Aβ42O's targeting and binding. Molecular docking revealed that both CA and EGCG effectively maintained the active conformation of Aβ42M; in contrast, EGCG also effectively rendered Aβ42O units inactive, primarily by disrupting and covering the hydrophobic clusters. Furthermore, CA and EGCG improved the AD brain microenvironment, including reducing Aβ42 plaque burden and supporting brain cell populations. In conclusion, CA and EGCG inhibited the structure, bioactivity, and cell-targeting ability of Aβ42 aggregates; however, they protected these aspects of Aβ42M. These findings are essential for understanding the neuroprotective mechanisms of plant polyphenols.",Mol Neurobiol,2025

We assessed brain perfusion, atrophy, dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake, and language function among patients with lvPPA based on beta-amyloid. Thirty-three patients with lvPPA and 28 healthy controls (HCs) underwent MRI, <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben PET, and early- and late-phase DAT PET. All patients completed a language test. General linear models were applied to investigate the association of brain imaging with the aphasia quotient (AQ) and repetition scores. 20 (60.6%) and 13 (39.4%) of the lvPPA patients were amyloid-positive (lvPPA<sup>A+</sup>) and -negative (lvPPA<sup>A-</sup>), respectively. Language function was comparable between groups. Compared to HCs, the lvPPA<sup>A+</sup> had lower perfusion across widespread brain regions, the lvPPA<sup>A-</sup> had lower perfusion in the left supramarginal and angular gyri, and both groups had lower DAT in the left caudate and bilateral substantia nigra. In the lvPPA<sup>A-</sup>, AQ and repetition scores were positively correlated with perfusion in the left temporal and inferior parietal cortices, with perfusion in the left supramarginal gyrus mediating the effect of left substantia nigra DAT. Although AD is the most common underlying pathology of lvPPA, LBD may contribute to the logopenic phenotype.",Sci Rep,2025
39868840,Nutrition: A non-negligible factor in the pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction. The strong link between nutrition and the occurrence and progression of AD pathology has been well documented. Poor nutritional status accelerates AD progress by potentially aggravating amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau deposition, exacerbating oxidative stress response, modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and disrupting blood-brain barrier function. The advanced stage of AD tends to lead to malnutrition due to cognitive impairments, sensory dysfunctions, brain atrophy, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). This, in turn, produces a vicious cycle between malnutrition and AD. This review discusses how nutritional factors and AD deteriorate each other from the early stage of AD to the terminal stages of AD, focusing on the potential of different levels of nutritional factors, ranging from micronutrients to diet patterns. This review provides novel insights into reducing the risk of AD, delaying its progression, and improving prognosis. HIGHLIGHTS: Two-fifths of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases worldwide have been attributed to potentially modifiable risk factors. Up to ≈26% of community-dwelling patients with AD are malnourished, compared to 7%∼76% of institutionalized patients. Undernutrition effects the onset, progression, and prognosis of AD through multiple mechanisms. Various levels of nutritional supports were confirmed to be protective factors for AD via specific mechanisms.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40013096,Exploring cognitive and neuroimaging profiles of dementia subtypes of individuals with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"OBJECTIVE: The 2024 Alzheimer's Association (AA) research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) considers fluid biomarkers, including promising blood-based biomarkers for detecting AD. This study aims to identify dementia subtypes and their cognitive and neuroimaging profiles in older adults with dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using biomarkers and clinical data.
METHODS: Forty-five individuals with dementia over 65 years old were evaluated using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and the informant-based Alzheimer's Questionnaire. Core AD biomarkers (Aβ42/40 and p-tau181) and non-specific neurodegeneration biomarkers (NfL, GFAP) were measured in blood plasma. Neuroimaging structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia subtypes were determined based on plasma biomarker pathology and vascular markers. Biomarker cutoff scores were identified to optimize sensitivity and specificity. Individuals were stratified into one of four dementia subtypes-AD only, non-AD vascular, non-AD other, or mixed - based on combinations of abnormalities in these markers.
RESULTS: Among the 45 individuals with dementia, mixed dementia had the highest prevalence (42.4%), followed by AD-only (24.4%), non-AD other dementia (22.2%), and non-AD vascular dementia subtypes (11.1%). Both cognitive and neuroimaging profiles aligned poorly with biomarker classifications in the full sample. Cognitive tests varied across dementia subtypes. The cognitive profile of the AD-only and mixed groups suggested relatively low cognitive performance, while the non-AD and other groups had the best scores on average.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with studies in other settings, our preliminary findings suggest that neurodegenerative plasma biomarkers may help to identify dementia subtypes and provide insight into cognitive and neuroimaging profiles among older adults in the DRC.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39713891,Association of APOE alleles and polygenic profiles comprising APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 variants with Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging markers.,"INTRODUCTION: TOMM40 and APOC1 variants can modulate the APOE-ε4-related Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by up to fourfold. We aim to investigate whether the genetic modulation of ε4-related AD risk is reflected in brain morphology.
METHODS: We tested whether 27 magnetic resonance imaging-derived neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration (volume and thickness in temporo-limbic regions) are associated with APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 polygenic profiles using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set linked to the AD Genetic Consortium data.
RESULTS: All brain regions studied using structural phenotypes were smaller in individuals with AD. The ε4 allele was associated with smaller limbic (entorhinal, hippocampus, parahippocampus) brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cases than controls. There were significant differences in the associations for the higher-risk and lower-risk ε4-bearing APOE-TOMM40-APOC1 profiles with temporo-limbic region markers.
DISCUSSION: The APOE-AD heterogeneity may be partly attributed to the modulating role of the TOMM40 and APOC1 genes in the APOE cluster.
HIGHLIGHTS: The ε4 allele is associated with smaller values of neuroimaging markers in AD cases. Larger values of neuroimaging markers may protect against AD in the ε4 carriers. TOMM40 and APOC1 variants differentiate AD risk in the ε4 carriers. The same variants can differentiate the links between ε4 and neuroimaging markers.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

This study explored these associations across the AD continuum, focusing on core AD biomarkers and markers of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction.ObjectiveWe investigated whether 1) KL-VSHET is associated with lower AD biomarker burden (Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio, P-tau181, T-tau) and neurodegeneration (NfL); 2) sαKl relates to AD biomarkers, neurodegeneration (NfL), neuroinflammation (GFAP), and synaptic dysfunction (Ng); 3) associations vary by APOE ε4 status and clinical subgroup.MethodsParticipants (n = 223) were categorized as cognitively healthy (n = 38), aMCI-AD (n = 94), and AD dementia (n = 91). KLOTHO genotyping was available for 128 participants; 138 had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum sαKl measurements; and 42 had both. Multiple linear regression evaluated associations between KL-VSHET, sαKl levels, and biomarkers, stratified by APOE ε4 status and clinical subgroup.ResultsOverall, the associations between KL-VSHET and higher CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> and Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio were non-significant (ps ≥ 0.059) except when restricted to APOE ε4 carriers only (β = 0.11, p = 0.008 and β = 0.16, p = 0.033, respectively). Within clinical subgroups, KL-VSHET was positively associated with Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio only in aMCI-AD (β = 0.23, p = 0.034). No significant associations were observed between KL-VSHET and tau biomarkers or NfL. For sαKl, associations with biomarkers were non-significant except for a negative association of serum sαKl with P-tau181 in aMCI-AD (β = -0.25, p = 0.036) and a positive association with Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio in APOE ε4 non-carriers (β = 0.24 p = 0.047).ConclusionsKL-VSHET may help protect against amyloid pathology, particularly in the presence of APOE ε4, and regardless of APOE status in aMCI-AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40037549,Cell-type-specific expression of Nav1.6 in the developing brain of mice and its involvement in glial activation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav's), particularly Nav1.6, are crucial for action potential generation in neurons and are linked to brain disorders. This study explores the cell-type-specific expression of Nav1.6 in C57BL/6 mice brains at various developmental stages. Coronal sections from embryonic day 14 to postnatal day 30 were examined. Nav1.6 expression increased at both protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels during this period. Immunofluorescence double staining revealed that Nav1.6 is primarily localized on neurons. Astrocytes show increasing expression from prenatal to postnatal stages, correlating with maturation. Microglia exhibit low-intensity expression throughout the development. Co-expression of Nav1.6 with oligodendrocyte precursor cell marker NG2 is observed from E14 through postnatal stages, with prominent co-expression on day 21 and day 30. Consistent co-expression with olig2 is observed from E16 to day 30. In primary cultures, astrocytes had higher Nav1.6 levels compared to microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Nav1.6 expression was upregulated in astrocytes and microglia in APP/amyloid beta precursor protein/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice. Down-regulating Nav1.6 in vitro reduced amyloid beta-induced microglial activation and cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α). These findings highlight Nav1.6 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions against neurodegenerative diseases.",Cereb Cortex,2025
39767810,Cerebrospinal Fluid Classical Biomarker Levels in Mixed vs. Pure A<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> (A<sup>+</sup>T<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>) Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) may present with pure (typical or atypical) and mixed phenotypes, sometimes causing difficulties in (differential) diagnosis. In order to achieve a diagnostic accuracy as high as possible, the diagnosis of AD during life depends on various biomarkers, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Methods: Classical CSF AD biomarkers were determined in a total of 61 patients, classified as both beta amyloid- and tau-positive A<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> (or A<sup>+</sup>T<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> according to the recently revised Alzheimer Association criteria for diagnosis and staging of AD). Twenty one of these patients fulfilled the criteria for mixed AD (mixed with Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular disease, or normal pressure hydrocephalus), whilst 40 had pure AD. Results: Patients did not differ with respect to gender, education, disease duration, and cognitive status. After controlling for confounding factors, no difference was observed between mixed and pure AD groups in Aβ<sub>42</sub> or Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels. Although by definition, patients of both groups had abnormal (increased) levels of phospho-tau<sub>181</sub>, the mixed AD group presented with lower (less abnormal) levels of phospho-tau181 and total tau as compared to the pure group. Conclusions: In patients with AD of comparable cognitive status, mixed AD cases may present with lower levels of tau proteins and, if close to the cut-off values, diagnostic uncertainty may be increased.",Biomedicines,2024
39756430,The changes in the ratio of Dicer1 transcripts can participate in the neuronal hypoxic response by regulating miR-29b.,"The nervous system is highly dependent on the supply of oxygen and nutrients, so when demand for oxygen exceeds its supply, hypoxia is induced. The hippocampus is very important in the nervous system. It has the ability to control human behavior, memory, emotion, and so on. Therefore, when the hippocampus is damaged by hypoxia, it may cause nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Alternative splicing plays an important regulatory role in the processes of growth and disease occurrence and development. However, the function of hypoxia-induced alternative splicing in neurological diseases needs to be further studied. Therefore, we performed hypoxia stress on mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells and then analyzed differentially expressed genes and differential alternative splicing events by next-generation sequencing. Through bioinformatics analysis and verification, it was found that hypoxia stress regulated the expression of Rbm15 and the ratio of Dicer1 transcripts in HT22 cells. The change in the ratio of Dicer1 transcripts may be related to the upregulation of miR-29b under hypoxia stress. This study can provide multiple time point sequencing results and a theoretical basis for the study of hypoxia-related gene alternative splicing.",Cereb Cortex,2025

39692476,Curation and validation of electronic medical record-based dementia diagnoses in the VA Million Veteran Program.,"BACKGROUND: The age distribution and diversity of the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort make it a valuable resource for studying the genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: We present and evaluate the performance of several International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based classification algorithms for AD, ADRD, and dementia for use in MVP genetic studies and other studies using VA electronic medical record (EMR) data. These were benchmarked relative to existing ICD algorithms and AD-medication-identified cases.
METHODS: We used chart review of n = 103 MVP participants to evaluate diagnostic utility of the algorithms. Suitability for genetic studies was examined by assessing association with APOE ε4, the strongest genetic AD risk factor, in a large MVP cohort (n = 286 K).
RESULTS: The newly developed MVP-ADRD algorithm performed well, comparable to the existing PheCode dementia algorithm (Phe-Dementia) in terms of sensitivity (0.95 and 0.95) and specificity (0.65 and 0.70). The strongest APOE ε4 associations were observed in cases identified using MVP-ADRD and Phe-Dementia augmented with medication-identified cases (MVP-ADRD or medication, p = 3.6 ×10<sup>-290</sup>; Phe-Dementia or medication, p = 1.4 ×10<sup>-290</sup>). Performance was improved when cases were restricted to those with onset age ≥60.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that our MVP-developed ICD-based algorithms had good performance in chart review and generated strong genetic signals, especially after inclusion of medication-identified cases. Ultimately, our MVP-derived algorithms are likely to have good performance in the broader VA, and their performance may also be suitable for use in other large-scale EMR-based biobanks in the absence of definitive biomarkers such as amyloid-PET and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39779911,Modulating mTOR-dependent astrocyte substate transitions to alleviate neurodegeneration.,"Traditional approaches to studying astrocyte heterogeneity have mostly focused on analyzing static properties, failing to identify whether subtypes represent intermediate or final states of reactive astrocytes. Here we show that previously proposed neuroprotective and neurotoxic astrocytes are transitional states rather than distinct subtypes, as revealed through time-series multiomic sequencing. Neuroprotective astrocytes are an intermediate state of the transition from a nonreactive to a neurotoxic state in response to neuroinflammation, a process regulated by the mTOR signaling pathway. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging, we observed an imbalance in neurotoxic and neuroprotective astrocytes in animal models and human patients. Moreover, targeting mTOR in astrocytes with rapamycin or shRNA mitigated astrocyte neurotoxic effects in neurodegenerative mouse models. Overall, our study uncovers a mechanism through which astrocytes exhibit neuroprotective functions before becoming neurotoxic under neuroinflammatory conditions and highlights mTOR modulation specifically in astrocytes as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.",Nat Aging,2025
39807599,Unraveling the transcriptomic landscape of brain vascular cells in dementia: A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of dementia and related neurodegenerative disorders. Recent omics-driven research has revealed associations between vascular abnormalities and transcriptomic alterations in brain vascular cells, particularly endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes (PCs). However, the impact of these molecular changes on dementia remains unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in ECs and PCs across neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, and arteriovenous malformation, utilizing transcriptomic data from published postmortem human tissue studies.
RESULTS: We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consistently dysregulated in ECs and PCs across these pathologies. Notably, several DEGs are linked to vascular cell zonation and genetic risks for AD and cerebral small vessel disease.
DISCUSSION: Our findings provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction in dementia, highlight the knowledge gaps, and suggest potential novel vascular therapeutic targets, including genes not previously investigated in this context.
HIGHLIGHTS: Systematic review of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in vascular cells from neurodegenerative single-nuclear RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) studies. Identify overlapping DEGs in multiple vascular cell types across studies. Examine functional relevance and associations with genetic risk for common DEGs.

39753643,Addressing inter individual variability in CSF levels of brain derived proteins across neurodegenerative diseases.,"Accurate diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases require reliable biomarkers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are promising candidates for reflecting brain pathology; however, their diagnostic utility may be compromised by natural variability between individuals, weakening their association with disease. Here, we measured the levels of 69 pre-selected proteins in cerebrospinal fluid using antibody-based suspension bead array technology in a multi-disease cohort of 499 individuals with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), corticobasal syndrome, primary supranuclear palsy, along with healthy controls. We identify significant inter-individual variability in overall CSF levels of brain-derived proteins, which could not be attributed to specific disease associations. Using linear modelling, we show that adjusting for median CSF levels of brain-derived proteins increases the diagnostic accuracy of proteins previously identified as altered in CSF in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We further demonstrate a simplified approach for the adjustment using pairs of correlated proteins with opposite alteration in the diseases. With this approach, the proteins adjust for each other and further increase the biomarker performance through additive effect. When comparing the diseases, two proteins-neurofilament medium and myelin basic protein-showed increased levels in ALS compared to other diseases, and neurogranin showed a specific increase in AD. Several other proteins showed similar trends across the studied diseases, indicating that these proteins likely reflect shared processes related to neurodegeneration. Overall, our findings suggest that accounting for inter-individual variability is crucial in future studies to improve the identification and performance of relevant biomarkers. Importantly, we highlight the need for multi-disease studies to identify disease-specific biomarkers.",Sci Rep,2025
40182757,Parishin A ameliorates cognitive decline by promoting PS1 autophagy in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Its pathological features include: A lot of misfolding and abnormal aggregation of amyloid protein (Aβ); Autophagy disorder, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, abnormal phosphorylated tau protein and synaptic dysfunction. Modern pharmacological studies have found that Paisinhin A (PA) has beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of central nervous system diseases. This study aims to explore the role and mechanism of PA in AD through autophagy pathway, and lay a scientific foundation for the development of clinical prevention and treatment strategies for AD.
METHODS: N2A<sup>APP</sup> cells were treated with different concentrations of PA. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 method. Western blotting detected the expression levels of proteins related to amyloid production, autophagy pathway, and phosphorylated Tau expression levels. Autophagy flow was detected by transfecting Lc3 double fluorescent plasmid. After Aβ was injected into the hippocampus of WT mice and PA was injected intraperitoneally, the learning and memory ability of WT mice were tested by new object recognition, y maze and water maze. The oxidative stress level was detected by the kit. The levels of inflammatory factors were detected by RT-qpcr.
RESULTS: The viability of N2A<sup>APP</sup> cells was not affected at different concentrations of PA, but PS1 was significantly decreased at 40μM. PA can obviously improve the accumulation of autophagy in AD, and to some extent save the autophagy inhibition of CQ. Behavioral studies have shown that PA can also improve learning and memory impairments caused by Aβ injections. In addition, in vivo experiments, PA can also improve oxidative stress levels, inflammation levels and salvage dysfunctions of synapses. PA also reduces the levels of total and phosphorylated Tau in N2A<sup>Tau</sup>.
DISCUSSION: Our study provides the first evidence that PA improves learning and memory in Aβ-induced AD mice. This effect appears to be mediated by PA by promoting autophagy and reducing oxidative stress. It was also found that PA may have a role in regulating inflammation, improving abnormally phosphorylated tau, and salvaging damaged synaptic function, providing valuable insights into potential applications in the treatment and prevention of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025

40037709,Deep learning-based cell-specific gene regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multiome data.,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a global representation of how genetic/genomic information is transferred in living systems and are a key component in understanding genome regulation. Single-cell multiome data provide unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct GRNs at fine-grained resolution. However, the inference of GRNs is hindered by insufficient single omic profiles due to the characteristic high loss rate of single-cell sequencing data. In this study, we developed scMultiomeGRN, a deep learning framework to infer transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks via unique integration of single-cell genomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and epigenomic (single-cell ATAC sequencing) data. We create scMultiomeGRN to elucidate these networks by conceptualizing TF network graph structures. Specifically, we build modality-specific neighbor aggregators and cross-modal attention modules to learn latent representations of TFs from single-cell multi-omics. We demonstrate that scMultiomeGRN outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark datasets involved in diseases and health. Via scMultiomeGRN, we identified Alzheimer's disease-relevant regulatory network of SPI1 and RUNX1 for microglia. In summary, scMultiomeGRN offers a deep learning framework to identify cell type-specific gene regulatory network from single-cell multiome data.",Nucleic Acids Res,2025
40057772,"Diabetes status, duration, and risk of dementia among ischemic stroke patients.","BACKGROUND: The influence of duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the likelihood of developing new-onset dementia in post-stroke population is not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the duration of T2DM and the risk of developing dementia in the post-stroke population.
METHODS: Leveraging the Korean National Health Insurance Database, this study included 118,790 individuals with a history of stroke but no previous dementia diagnosis. We classified diabetes status into five categories: normoglycemia, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), newly diagnosed T2DM, and established T2DM with durations of less than 5 years and 5 years or more. The primary endpoint was the incidence of all-cause dementia.
RESULTS: Among 118,790 participants (average age 64.26 ± 9.95 years, 48% male), 16.7% developed dementia during an average follow-up of 7.3 ± 2.3 years. Participants with a history of T2DM for less than five years at cohort entry had a 26.7% higher risk of developing all-cause dementia compared to those with normoglycemia. Those with T2DM for five years or longer had a 46.7% increased risk, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.466 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.408-1.527). Specifically, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) rose by 43.4% and 51.4%, respectively, for individuals with T2DM lasting more than five years (aHR 1.434, 95% CI 1.366-1.505; aHR 1.514, 95% CI 1.365-1.679, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated a significant association between an extended duration of T2DM and an increased risk of developing all-cause dementia, including AD and VaD in post-stroke population. These results emphasize proactive dementia prevention approaches in stroke survivors, particularly those with longstanding T2DM.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40044873,Optical signature of retinal Tau fibrillation.,"Fibrillated Tau proteins are believed to be a signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be potentially employed as a biosensor for AD early detection. Several studies revealed the presence of Tau accumulation and aggregation in the retina, similar to that observed in the brains of individuals with AD. These retinal changes can be non-invasively visualised through AD-related scores derived from reflectance measurements of the patient fundus. However, a direct link with the optical properties of fibrillated protein clusters is still lacking. Here, we present a new optical technique which measures the scattering optical properties of protein fibrils. Our experimental findings show that the scattering intensity of Tau has a wavelength dependence correlated to their size. The optical signal qualitatively replicates the spectral signature observed in human AD patient retinas. Our paper shows that the Tau protein spectral signature is compatible with the distinctive spectral signature of the AD, further confirming that retinal investigation is a promising tool.",Sci Rep,2025
39907198,The genetic landscape of early-onset Alzheimer's disease in China.,"INTRODUCTION: Research on somatic and germline mutations in Chinese individuals with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) has been limited.
METHODS: We conducted whole-genome sequencing of blood DNA from 108 patients with EOAD and 116 controls. The analysis included somatic and germline mutations across coding and non-coding regions, mutational signature determination, pathway enrichment identification, and predictive model.
RESULTS: The mutational burden was significantly higher in the EOAD group compared to the control group. The prevalence of single-base substitution signature 5, which is strongly associated with aging, was much higher in patients with EOAD than in controls. EOAD-specific somatic mutations were identified in genes such as MIR31HG, TUBB4B, and APP. Germline mutations in DOCK3, PCSK5, and PDE4D were significantly associated with age of dementia onset. Furthermore, a predictive model comprising 15 mutations demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.78.
DISCUSSION: The accumulation of senescence-related somatic mutations may increase the risk of developing EOAD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Whole genome sequencing was used to find somatic and germline mutations in Chinese individuals with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Total number and burden of blood somatic mutations were significantly higher. The prevalence of single-base substitution signature 5 was notably elevated in EOAD. EOAD-specific somatic mutations were identified in MIR31HG, TUBB4B, and APP. DOCK3, PCSK5, and PDE4D germline mutations were associated with the age of EOAD onset.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39743828,Whole genome methylation sequencing in blood from persons with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease identifies cognitive status.,"INTRODUCTION: Whole genome methylation sequencing (WGMS) in blood identifies differential DNA methylation in persons with late-onset dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has not been tested in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We used WGMS to compare DNA methylation levels at 25,244,219 CpG loci in 382 blood samples from 99 persons with MCI, 109 with AD, and 174 who are cognitively unimpaired (CU).
RESULTS: WGMS identified 9756 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in persons with MCI, including 1743 differentially methylated genes encoding proteins in biological pathways related to synapse organization, dendrite development, and ion transport. A total of 447 DMPs exhibit progressively increasing or decreasing DNA methylation levels among CU, MCI, and AD that correspond to cognitive status.
DISCUSSION: WGMS identifies DMPs in known and newly detected genes in blood from persons with MCI and AD that support blood DNA methylation levels can distinguish cognitive status.
HIGHLIGHTS: Whole genome methylation levels in blood from 99 persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 109 with Alzheimer's disease, and 174 who are cognitively unimpaired were analyzed. Nine thousand seven hundred fifty-six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified in MCI. One thousand seven hundred forty-three genes comprise one or more DMPs in persons with MCI. Fifty-eight DMPs and 392 differentially methylated genes are shared among the three pairwise comparisons. Four hundred forty-seven DMPs exhibit progressive changes that correspond to cognitive status.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39894919,"Unveiling the link between APOE ε4, environmental factors, and Alzheimer's disease in North Lebanon: A case-control study.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and progressive neurodegenerative disorder influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is known to have a pivotal impact on disease onset, yet clinical studies on its impact on AD remain scarce in Lebanon.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the interplay between environmental risk factors, the APOE gene, and AD in North Lebanon.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted with 136 individuals, including 57 AD patients and 79 normal individuals, among which 55 individuals were verified to be cognitively normal via the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A comprehensive survey was used to collect data on lifestyle factors, medical history, and other possible diseases and deficiencies. Blood samples were collected from all participants, then their DNA was isolated and stored. Real-time PCR was adopted for genotyping.
RESULTS: The total APOE ε4 allele prevalence was reduced from 19.1% to 16.1% after MMSE adjustment. Based on the univariate analysis, factors like age, illiteracy, vitamin and iron deficiencies, blood pressure, and chronic diseases were identified as prominent risk factors, while the allele showed no significant correlation with AD. However, in the multivariable analysis, this allele emerged as a key risk factor (p = 0.04). Factors like age ≥ 65, vitamin deficiency, iron deficiency, blood pressure, and other chronic diseases were consistently significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide significant evidence that the influence of APOE ε4 on AD is governed by several environmental factors such as age, vitamin and iron deficiencies, high blood pressure, and chronic diseases.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39702338,Impact of gender on the willingness to participate in clinical trials and undergo related procedures in individuals from an Alzheimer's prevention research cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Although there is growing evidence of the association between gender and early diagnosis of preclinical Alzheimer's disease, little attention has been given to the enrolment ratio of men and women in clinical trials and data reporting.
METHODS: This study aims to analyze gender differences in sociodemographic factors associated with the willingness to participate in clinical trials and undergo specific procedures in the context of an Alzheimer's disease prevention research cohort. 2544 cognitively unimpaired participants from the ALFA parent cohort (age 45-75 years) of the Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center were contacted through a structured phone call to determine their willingness to participate in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials and undergo trial-related procedures (magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, positron emission tomography, and cognitive assessment). Sociodemographic data on education, occupational attainment, civil and caregiver status were gathered. Stepwise logistic regression models were performed in order to study the interaction between gender and sociodemographic factors in the willingness to participate in clinical trials and to undergo clinical trial-related procedures.
RESULTS: 1,606 out of the 2,544 participants were women (63.1%). Women were significantly younger and had lower educational attainment compared with men. In addition, women were more likely to be caregivers, single and unemployed. Women showed a significantly lower willingness than men to participate in a clinical trial (p = 0.003) and to undergo a lumbar puncture (p < 0.001). Single women were less willing to participate in clinical trials than single men (p = 0.041). Regarding clinical trial-related procedures, women with higher years of education were significantly less willing to undergo a lumbar puncture (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: We found gender differences regarding the sociodemographic factors that predict the willingness to participate in clinical trials and to undergo clinical trial-related procedures. Our results highlight the urgent need to design recruitment strategies accounting for gender-related factors, particularly those related to marital status and education.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39845734,Brain microstructure alterations in subjective cognitive decline: a multi-component T2 relaxometry study.,"Previous research has revealed patterns of brain atrophy in subjective cognitive decline, a potential preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. However, the involvement of myelin content and microstructural alterations in subjective cognitive decline has not previously been investigated. This study included three groups of participants recruited from the Compostela Aging Study project: 53 cognitively unimpaired adults, 16 individuals with subjective cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy and 70 with subjective cognitive decline and no hippocampal atrophy. Group differences were analysed across five MRI biomarkers derived from multi-component T2 relaxometry, each sensitive to variations in cerebral composition and microstructural tissue integrity. Although no significant differences in myelin content were observed between groups, the subjective cognitive decline with hippocampal atrophy group exhibited a larger free-water fraction, and reduced fraction and relaxation times of the intra/extracellular water compartment in frontal, parietal and medial temporal lobe brain regions and white matter tracts as compared with the other groups. Moreover, both subjective cognitive decline groups displayed lower total water content as compared with the control group and the subjective cognitive decline with hippocampal atrophy group showed lower total water content as compared with the subjective cognitive decline without hippocampal atrophy group. These changes are likely related to microstructural tissue differences related to neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, iron accumulation or other physiologic variations, calling for further examinations.",Brain Commun,2025
39799207,Obtaining personalized predictions from a randomized controlled trial on Alzheimer's disease.,"The purpose of this article is to infer patient level outcomes from population level randomized control trials (RCTs). In this pursuit, we utilize the recently proposed synthetic nearest neighbors (SNN) estimator. At its core, SNN leverages information across patients to impute missing data associated with each patient of interest. We focus on two types of missing data: (i) unrecorded outcomes from discontinuing the assigned treatments and (ii) unobserved outcomes associated with unassigned treatments. Data imputation in the former powers and de-biases RCTs, while data imputation in the latter simulates ""synthetic RCTs"" to predict the outcomes for each patient under every treatment. The SNN estimator is interpretable, transparent, and causally justified under a broad class of missing data scenarios. Relative to several standard methods, we empirically find that SNN performs well for the above two applications using Phase 3 clinical trial data on patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Our findings directly suggest that SNN can tackle a current pain point within the clinical trial workflow on patient dropouts and serve as a new tool towards the development of precision medicine. Building on our insights, we discuss how SNN can further generalize to real-world applications.",Sci Rep,2025
39814858,Revealing excitation-inhibition imbalance in Alzheimer's disease using multiscale neural model inversion of resting-state functional MRI.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder without a clear understanding of pathophysiology. Recent experimental data have suggested neuronal excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance as an essential element of AD pathology, but E-I imbalance has not been systematically mapped out for either local or large-scale neuronal circuits in AD, precluding precise targeting of E-I imbalance in AD treatment.
METHOD: In this work, we apply a Multiscale Neural Model Inversion (MNMI) framework to the resting-state functional MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to identify brain regions with disrupted E-I balance in a large network during AD progression.
RESULTS: We observe that both intra-regional and inter-regional E-I balance is progressively disrupted from cognitively normal individuals, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to AD. Also, we find that local inhibitory connections are more significantly impaired than excitatory ones and the strengths of most connections are reduced in MCI and AD, leading to gradual decoupling of neural populations. Moreover, we reveal a core AD network comprised mainly of limbic and cingulate regions. These brain regions exhibit consistent E-I alterations across MCI and AD, and thus may represent important AD biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Lastly, the E-I balance of multiple brain regions in the core AD network is found to be significantly correlated with the cognitive test score.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study constitutes an important attempt to delineate E-I imbalance in large-scale neuronal circuits during AD progression, which may facilitate the development of new treatment paradigms to restore physiological E-I balance in AD.",Commun Med (Lond),2025
40179230,Religious stress coping is associated with lower entorhinal tau pathology and better memory performance in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Stress is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but religious stress coping practices, (e.g., prayer and attending religious services) may reduce this risk. We investigated the relation between religious stress coping and memory in cognitively-unimpaired individuals from the Colombian kindred with autosomal dominant AD. Additionally, we examined the link between religious stress coping and brain pathology. Religious coping was associated with lower entorhinal tau (p = 0.02) and better memory performance (p = 0.04) in Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers, but not in non-carriers. These findings suggest that religious coping may mitigate AD tau pathology and cognitive decline and warrant further investigation.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39791144,Mitochondrial Fragmentation as a Key Driver of Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Mitochondrial form and function are intricately linked through dynamic processes of fusion and fission, and disruptions in these processes are key drivers of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's. The inability of mitochondria to transition between their dynamic forms is a critical factor in the development of pathological states. In this paper, we focus on the importance of different types of mitochondrial phenotypes in nervous tissue, discussing how mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease are ""stuck"" in certain patterns and how this pattern maintains itself. Understanding the specific roles and transitions between mitochondrial forms, including tiny, networked, and hyperfused, is crucial in developing new therapies aimed at restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. By targeting these dynamics, we may be able to intervene early in the disease process, offering novel avenues for preventing or treating neurodegeneration.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
39920091,"Motor correlates of finger tapping variability in subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment and probable Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Variability of finger tapping speeds, especially in the non-dominant hand, has been reported in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI-A) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD). An explanation of this finding, however, has not appeared.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate possible motor correlates of finger tapping variability in normal older healthy controls (HC), persons with subjective memory complaints (SMC), MCI-A and probable AD.
METHODS: Using a modified version of the Halstead Finger Tapping Test (HFTT), individual finger tapping movements were classified as ""valid"" (i.e., advanced the number on a mechanical counter) or ""invalid"" (i.e., did not advance the number). Failures at selective motor inhibition and learning and fatigue effects were also measured.
RESULTS: Finger tapping variability was significantly greater in the non-dominant hand in probable AD patients compared to HC and SMC patients. MCI-A and probable AD patients did not differ on this measure. Finger tapping variability was significantly correlated (ρ = + 0.65) with the number of invalid tapping responses but not with selective motor inhibition failures. A small but significant correlation of dominant hand learning effect with finger tapping variability was found. Invalid tapping responses were significantly greater in MCI and probable AD groups compared to HC and SMC groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of invalid tapping responses strongly correlated with finger tapping variability. The number of invalid tapping responses may have diagnostic and prognostic significance when evaluating older individuals with known or suspected memory impairment of a neurodegenerative type.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39984462,Early Alzheimer's Disease with frequent neuritic plaques harbors neocortical tau seeds distinct from primary age-related tauopathy.,"Tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques are required for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and closely track with cognitive impairment, yet cognitively normal aged individuals frequently exhibit NFTs arising from tau seed accumulation. This may suggest that not all tau species are equally pathogenic and raises the question of whether unidentified tau modifications augment tau seeding activity and neurodegeneration in AD. We investigated how biochemical modifications of tau relate to clinicopathological outcomes in a cohort of 38 patients with Braak-matched AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) or primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a 3R/4R tauopathy with identical tau filament core structure to ADNC but with little to no Aβ deposition. We comprehensively measured tau histologic density, seeding activity using real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) seed amplification assays, and select post-translational modifications (PTMs) (i.e. pT217, pS202/T205, & C-terminal epitopes) in hippocampus and neocortex. Even in cases without overt neocortical tau neuropathology, substantial hippocampal and neocortical tau seeding occurred in both PART and ADNC and predicted region-specific cognitive performance and longitudinal decline. Notably, tau seeding and PTM profiles were associated with Aβ neuritic plaque density and differentiated ADNC from PART in neocortex. Our data indicate that tau seed modifications meaningfully relate to disease trajectory, potentially explaining the more severe cognitive dysfunction observed in late-stage AD versus PART.",Nat Commun,2025
39855320,Decreased serum PF4 levels correlate with cognitive decline and CSF biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a chemotactic factor secreted from the α-granules of platelets, has recently been proved to mitigate neuroinflammation and improve aging-related cognition decline, which may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the alterations of serum PF4 levels in AD, the correlation between serum PF4 and β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the potential diagnostic utility of PF4 in AD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 38 amyloid-positive AD patients and 50 cognitively normal controls. The levels of serum PF4 were detected using the Human CXCL4/PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit. The levels of CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, and t-tau were measured on the fully-automated Lumipulse G1200 platform via commercially available kits.
RESULTS: The levels of serum PF4 were significantly decreased in AD patients (5163.51 (3198.24-6301.15) vs. 5859.29 (4126.06-8006.70), Z = -2.30, P = 0.021). The negative correlation between AD diagnosis (β = -1972.292, P = 0.009) and PF4 levels retained after the adjustments of age, sex, APOE ε4 status, platelet count, platelet distribution width (PDW), and comorbidity of dyslipidemia in the multiple linear regression analysis. Further analysis showed that serum PF4 levels were positively correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and negatively correlated with CSF t-tau levels. Besides, the area under the curve (AUC) of serum PF4 for AD (AUC = 0.6437, P = 0.022) was comparable to that of CSF Aβ40 (AUC = 0.6400) yet lower than those of CSF Aβ42, ptau181, and t-tau. The AUC slightly increased when combining serum PF4 with other CSF AD biomarkers separately.
CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of PF4 were decreased in AD patients and were significantly correlated with the cognitive function and CSF levels of Aβ42 and t-tau. PF4 may become a promising anti-aging and therapeutic target for AD, which is worthy of further study.",Exp Gerontol,2025

39865681,Increased unedited Alu RNA patterns found in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease resemble hippocampus vasculature Alu RNA editing patterns but not cortex Alu RNA editing patterns.,"BACKGROUND: Endogenous Alu RNAs form double-stranded RNAs recognized by double-stranded RNA sensors and activate IRF and NF-kB transcriptional paths and innate immunity. Deamination of adenosines to inosines by the ADAR family of enzymes, a process termed A-to-I editing, disrupts double-stranded RNA structure and prevents innate immune activation. Innate immune activation is observed in Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. We have previously reported loss of A-to-I editing in hippocampus vasculature, but no change in cortex or cortex vasculature, associated with Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the status of Alu RNA A-to-I editing in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: We used existing RNA-seq data sets and the SPRINT software package to determine levels of Alu RNA A-to-I editing in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease and control groups and compared these editing profiles to those found in both total cortex and hippocampus vasculature.
RESULTS: We find substantial loss of Alu A-to-I editing in cortex extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease. By measuring editing patterns on a gene-by-gene basis, we determined that editing patterns in cortex extracellular vesicles resemble editing patterns in hippocampus vasculature rather than total cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that hippocampus vasculature unedited Alu RNAs are packaged in extracellular vesicles, travel to the cortex, deliver their cargo and stimulate innate immunity and alter other basic biological processes contributing to Alzheimer's disease progression.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39716825,Impacts of adapted dance on mood and physical function among persons living with Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Most individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) experience one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation which negatively impacts their quality of life. Adapted dance integrates recorded music and movement that is appropriate for people with cognitive limitations. Adapted dance may be an enjoyable activity for persons living with ADRD and may provide psychological and physical benefits.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of an adapted dance intervention with persons with ADRD and the impacts of 12 weeks of adapted dancing on agitation, balance, gait, lower extremity strength, and caregiver burden.
METHODS: This study used an experimental design with repeated measures. Participants with ADRD were randomly assigned to a usual care or adapted line dance group that met 60 min twice a week. At pre-test, 4-, 8-, and 12 weeks of intervention, measures were collected for agitation, balance, gait, lower extremity strength, and caregiver burden.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 4 males and 12 females (n = 16) with ADRD whose age ranged from 69-97 years. Twelve weeks of adapted line dance was found acceptable by ADRD participants. Participants attended ≥90% of dance sessions and did not experience loss of balance or fall. ADRD participants danced an average of 70 min per week. Both groups had improvements in agitation from baseline to 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of adapted dance was shown to be feasible and enjoyable for persons living with ADRD. Clinicians should consider adapted dance as part of an exercise prescription.",J Alzheimers Dis,2024

39900729,Bauhinia coccinea extract prevents memory loss induced by scopolamine through activation of antiapoptotic and antioxidant pathways in mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by oxidative stress-mediated memory dysfunction and neuronal cell death. This study investigated the effects of an ethanol extract from Bauhinia coccinea (EEBC) on memory impairment and neuronal damage in a memory deficit mouse model. EEBC was administered to ICR mice at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg daily for 3 weeks. Cognitive impairment was induced via scopolamine (SCO) injection. Brain tissues were analyzed for acetylcholine (ACh) levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, neuronal apoptosis, and antioxidant markers. Behavioral tests showed that SCO injection induced memory loss, whereas EEBC significantly ameliorated SCO-mediated memory impairment. EEBC regulated the cholinergic system by decreasing ACh levels and enhancing AChE activity. Nissl staining and immunohistochemistry for NeuN showed that EEBC exerted neuroprotective effects in SCO-injected mice brains. Moreover, EEBC significantly reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive apoptotic cells increased by SCO treatment. EEBC also reversed the SCO-induced changes in apoptosis-related protein expression in brain tissues. Furthermore, EEBC significantly reduced malondialdehyde levels and activated catalase in SCO-administered brains. Quantitative RNA sequencing showed involvement of lipid metabolism in EEBC memory function regulation. Thus, EEBC is a promising candidate for attenuating AD progression as it targets the cholinergic system and neuronal apoptosis.",Sci Rep,2025

METHODS: We present findings from an individual with DS who remained cognitively stable despite AD neuropathology. Clinical assessments, fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging, and neuropathological examinations were conducted to characterize her condition.
RESULTS: Her apolipoprotein E was ε2/ε3 and genome-wide association study data indicated mosaicism. Neuroimaging revealed stable yet elevated amyloid and moderately elevated tau levels, while neuropathology indicated intermediate AD neuropathologic change with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathologies. The participant demonstrated stable cognitive functioning in her 60s, potentially attributed to genetic variations, cognitive resilience, and environmental enrichment.
DISCUSSION: These findings emphasize the complexity of AD progression in DS. Further investigation into factors influencing cognitive resilience in individuals with DS is warranted. Understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive stability in DS could offer insights into resilience to AD neuropathology in people with DS and inform future interventions.
HIGHLIGHTS: Findings from clinical assessments, fluid biomarkers, genotyping, neuroimaging, and neuropathological examinations of an individual with Down syndrome (DS) who remained cognitively stable despite Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology are presented. Neuroimaging revealed stable yet elevated amyloid profiles and moderately elevated tau levels, while neuropathology indicated intermediate AD neuropathologic change with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathologies.

Enrolment in clinical trials may be impacted by the availability of this and other treatments, and trial design must take into consideration that patients may desire a disease-modifying treatment rather than potentially being randomized to the placebo arm. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) Fall 2021 meeting discussed the consideration of well-defined AD staging criteria in protocol design and how they influence more standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria for trials, as well as what constitutes meaningful differentiation between the stages. Discussion explored the current state of knowledge regarding biomarkers and how they can inform AD staging criteria, as many trials are now designed based on specific biomarker features, further underscoring the importance of coordinating AD staging criteria and biomarkers. The relationship between cognition and biomarkers has been studied and this must continue as trials move forward. Researchers, patients, clinicians, regulatory scientists, and payers discussed the state of the field as well as the future of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from academia and industry as well as patients, care partners, clinicians, regulators, and payers to discuss the topic of operationalizing selection criteria for clinical trials and the role of biomarkers.Well-defined Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging criteria are an important consideration in study protocol design.Staging criteria and biomarkers must be coordinated to yield high-quality clinical trial results that have meaning for patients with AD by selecting a population most likely to benefit from a specific treatment.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40145416,"Validation of the CAMCOG-DS-II, a neuropsychological test battery for Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome: A Horizon 21 European Down syndrome Consortium study.","INTRODUCTION: The Cambridge Cognitive Examination modified for use in people with Down syndrome (CAMCOG-DS) is a sensitive cognitive test for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related decline in people with DS, but needs updates for sensitivity, cultural adaptability, and additional memory/executive function items. This study aimed to develop and validate the CAMCOG-DS-II.
METHODS: In this multi-language, multi-site study, the psychometric properties of the CAMCOG-DS-II were evaluated against previously validated measures in 223 participants (mean age: 40.18 years) with DS across seven countries.
RESULTS: The CAMCOG-DS-II had a high completion rate, minimal floor/ceiling effects (compared to the modified Cued Recall Test, the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning, and the Purdue Pegboard), strong validity and reliability, and performance was unaffected by language across sites. It differentiated between those with/without AD and distinguished clinically rated cognitively stable and prodromal individuals.
CONCLUSION: The CAMCOG-DS-II is a sensitive measure of cognitive performance in people with DS at risk of AD. Its cross-language and site reliability support its potential use in AD-DS clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Developed and validated the Cambridge Cognitive Examination modified for use in people with Down syndrome (CAMCOG-DS-II) for Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. CAMCOG-DS-II shows increased sensitivity to Alzheimer's disease-related decline in Down syndrome. Improved applicability across an international and culturally diverse population. Differentiates Alzheimer's disease status: cognitively stable, prodromal, and clinical.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39838483,Short-term variability of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in a mixed memory clinic cohort.,"BACKGROUND: For clinical implementation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers (BBMs), knowledge of short-term variability, is crucial to ensure safe and correct biomarker interpretation, i.e., to capture changes or treatment effects that lie beyond that of expected short-term variability and considered clinically relevant. In this study we investigated short-term intra- and inter-individual variability of AD biomarkers in the intended use population, memory clinic patients.
METHODS: In a consecutive sample of memory clinic patients (AD n = 27, non-AD n = 20), blood samples were collected on three separate days within a period of 36 days and analysed for plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, T-tau, neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We measured intra- and inter-individual variability and explored if the variability could be affected by confounding factors. Secondly, we established the minimum change required to detect a difference between two given blood samples that exceeds intra-individual variability and analytical variation (reference change value, RCV). Finally, we tested if classification accuracy varied across the three visits.
RESULTS: Intra-individual variability ranged from ~ 3% (Aβ42/40) to ~ 12% (T-tau). Inter-individual variability ranged from ~ 7% (Aβ40) to ~ 39% (NfL). Adjusting the models for time, eGFR, Hba1c, and BMI did not affect the variation. RCV was lowest for Aβ42/Aβ40 (- ~ 15%/ + ~ 17%) and highest in p-tau181 (- ~ 30/ + ~ 42%). No variation in classification accuracies was found across visits.
CONCLUSION: We found low intra-individual variability, robust to various factors, appropriate to capture individual changes in AD BBMs, while moderate inter-individual variability may give rise to caution in diagnostic contexts. High RCVs may pose challenges for AD BBMs with low fold changes and consequently, short-term variability is important to take into consideration when, e.g., estimating intervention effect and longitudinal changes of AD BBM levels.

40129417,Type 2 diabetes and late-onset Alzheimer's disease and related dementia: A longitudinal cohort study integrating polygenic risk score.,"BackgroundThe inherent genetic effects were not established between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD).ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate the association between T2DM and ADRD by integrating T2DM polygenic risk score (PRS) and applying matching in every subgroup.MethodsWe utilized UK Biobank First-occurrences datasets. T2DM were 1:1 matched to non-T2DM using propensity scores generated by 8 covariates; age at diagnosis, sex, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive disorders, lipid disorders, obesity, and mood disorders. T2DM PRS was additionally matched in T2DM PRS matched analysis. Subgroup analyses by age at diagnosis, sex, and APOE4 genotype were performed with the same matching criteria within each subgroup. Cox proportional hazard and Fine &amp; Gray competing risk model were utilized.ResultsIn T2DM PRS unmatched cohort, 24,583 T2DM were 1:1 matched to non-T2DM. The mean age at diagnosis was around 62 years old, with females constituting around 40%. Up to 25-year follow-up, ADRD rate/1000 person-years was 0.88 versus 1.52 (Non-T2DM versus T2DM); PRS unmatched (cHR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.46-2.03) and matched (cHR:1.75, 95% CI: 1.47-2.09). Except for older age onset (≥75 years), the other subgroups demonstrated significantly increased ADRD risks in T2DM. T2DM PRS was higher in non-ADRD group across all subgroups. Contrarily, T2DM PRS was higher in ADRD in younger onset group (&lt;55 years).ConclusionsT2DM is one of the strong risk factors of ADRD but genetic T2DM effect does not contribute to ADRD risk. However, a genetic link might be present in younger age onset group.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39780365,Intermittent Fasting Enhances Motor Coordination Through Myelin Preservation in Aged Mice.,"Integrating dietary interventions have been extensively studied for their health benefits, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and aging. However, it is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of long-term effects and practical applications of these dietary interventions for health. A 10-week intermittent fasting (IMF) regimen was implemented on the aging animals in the current study. The variations of cerebral functions were analyzed employing a comprehensive experimental design that includes behavioral tests, neuroimaging, and ultrastructural analysis, such as resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), EEG/EMG recordings, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Over a 10-week regimen, IMF significantly improved locomotor activity, motor coordination, and muscle strength compared to controls (p < 0.01). Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) demonstrated that IMF modulates brain-wide functional connectivity, enhancing communication between key brain regions. Advanced imaging techniques revealed increased expression of myelin-related proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), indicating enhanced myelin integrity and repair, particularly in axons with diameters < 400 nm (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that IMF may mitigate age-related declines by promoting better neuronal signaling. This study highlights the potential function of IMF as a non-pharmacological intervention to promote brain health and mitigate cognitive decline in aging populations.",Aging Cell,2025
39753567,regionalpcs improve discovery of DNA methylation associations with complex traits.,"We have developed the regionalpcs method, an approach for summarizing gene-level methylation. regionalpcs addresses the challenge of deciphering complex epigenetic mechanisms in diseases like Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to averaging, regionalpcs uses principal components analysis to capture complex methylation patterns across gene regions. Our method demonstrates a 54% improvement in sensitivity over averaging in simulations, providing a robust framework for identifying subtle epigenetic variations. Applying regionalpcs to Alzheimer's disease brain methylation data, combined with cell type deconvolution, we uncover 838 differentially methylated genes associated with neuritic plaque burden-significantly outperforming conventional methods. Integrating methylation quantitative trait loci with genome-wide association studies identified 17 genes with potential causal roles in Alzheimer's disease risk, including MS4A4A and PICALM. Available in the Bioconductor package regionalpcs, our approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the epigenetic landscape in Alzheimer's disease and opens avenues for research into complex diseases.",Nat Commun,2025
40114234,Impact of sleep apnea on alzheimer's disease in relation to sex: an 8-year longitudinal follow-up study of a nationwide cohort.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the association between sleep apnea and incident dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer type [DAT] and vascular dementia) and whether differences in the effects of sleep apnea on dementia depend on sex. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether obesity affects the sex-specific relationship between sleep apnea and dementia.
METHODS: We used de-identified data on patients with sleep apnea and a control group aged ≥ 50 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. After propensity score matching to balance age and sex between the patient and control groups, 30,111 individuals with sleep apnea (patient group) and 121,528 individuals without sleep apnea (control group) were included. To investigate the impact of sleep apnea on the development of dementia, we used Cox proportional hazards regression after controlling for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Sleep apnea was predictive of developing DAT in both women (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.44, p < 0.001) and men (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24, p = 0.012). The adverse effects of sleep apnea on DAT were more prominent in women than in men (p = 0.015 for sleep apnea×sex). Furthermore, obesity affected the sex-specific relationship between sleep apnea and DAT. Specifically, the adverse effects of obese sleep apnea on the DAT were more pronounced in women than in men (p = 0.002 for obese sleep apnea×sex). In contrast, there were no differences in the effects of non-obese sleep apnea on DAT between women and men (p = 0.667 for non-obese sleep apnea×sex).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight sex differences in the adverse effects of sleep apnea on DAT. Furthermore, these results suggest that sex-specific strategies for controlling sleep apnea are necessary to prevent DAT.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40121201,Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.,"5-hydroxymethylcytosine, also known as the sixth DNA base of the genome, plays an important role in brain aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about its genome-wide distribution and its association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we report a genome-wide profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in 1079 autopsied brains (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) of older individuals and assess its association with multiple measures of Alzheimer's disease pathologies, including pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β load, and PHFtau tangle density. Of 197,765 5-hydroxymethylcytosine regions detected, we identified 2821 differentially hydroxymethylated regions associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology after controlling for multiple testing and covariates. Many differentially hydroxymethylated regions are located within known Alzheimer's disease loci, such as RIN3, PLCG2, ITGA2B, and USP6NL. Integrative multi-omics analyses support a potential mechanistic role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations in Alzheimer's disease. Our study presents a large-scale genome-wide atlas of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Alzheimer's brain and offers insight into the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",Nat Commun,2025
39924838,Bayesian network modeling of statistical dependency within cognitive domains and clinical dementia severity ratings for Western and Indian cohorts.,"BackgroundDementia is studied rigorously in the current times, to assess the potential factors that contribute towards its progression, such as demographic factors, geographical background as well as to understand its impact on essential life skills. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is a major focus due to its prevalence and lack of curative treatments.ObjectiveWe aim to study dementia progression across two geographically distinct populations, by analyzing Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores and its domain-specific components, which reflect the decline in essential life skills. This analysis may support clinicians in designing targeted interventions.MethodsThis study investigates the statistical dependencies between the CDR and its six defining domain scores across two distinct aging datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI). We analyzed the dependencies among domain scores and their influence on the global CDR in both datasets using data-driven directed acyclic graphs, within Bayesian network models.ResultsDistinct notable similarities and differences in the associations and the edge strengths between the Western and Indian populations were identified. Memory showed similar prominence in contributing towards global CDR, while the incoming edges on memory domain reduced in LASI over ADNI, specifically from the domains, Home and hobbies, and Community affairs.ConclusionsThe analysis highlights a stronger dependency of CDR scores on memory functions in both datasets. The results overall elucidate population-specific differences and similarities in dementia progression across diverse demographic contexts.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39871385,The ABC transporter A7 modulates neuroinflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome in Alzheimer's disease mice.,"BACKGROUND: Specific genetic variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 locus (ABCA7) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). ABCA7 transports lipids from/across cell membranes, regulates Aβ peptide processing and clearance, and modulates microglial and T-cell functions to maintain immune homeostasis in the brain. During AD pathogenesis, neuroinflammation is one of the key mechanisms involved. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the specific role of ABCA7 in microglial activation via the NLRP3 inflammasome.
METHODS: We developed the first humanized, Cre-inducible ABCA7<sup>flx</sup> knock-in mouse model, crossbred it with the APPPS1-21 β-amyloidosis model, and generated constitutive ABCA7<sup>ko</sup> and microglia Cx3cr1-specific conditional ABCA7<sup>ko</sup> AD mice. The role of ABCA7 was analyzed using histological, biochemical, molecular and mass spectrometry methods.
RESULTS: Constitutive knockout of the Abca7 gene in APPPS1 mice increased the levels of Aβ42 and the number of IBA1+ (microglia) and GFAP+ (astrocytes) cells. Changes in the levels of astrocytes and microglia are associated with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL1β and TNFα. Interestingly, microglia-specific ABCA7<sup>ko</sup> restored Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide levels and IBA1<sup>+</sup> and GFAP<sup>+</sup> and NLRP3-related gene expression to the original APPPS1 mouse levels. In primary glial cell cultures of APPPS1-hA7<sup>ko</sup> microglia and APPPS1 astrocytes from newborn pups, we observed that conditioned media from LPS-stimulated microglia was able to induce NLRP3 inflammasome expression and proinflammatory cytokine release in astrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ABCA7 transporters regulate the communication between microglia and astrocytes through the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. This regulation implicates ABCA7 as a key driver ultimately involved in the persistence of the inflammatory response observed in AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40110649,Predicting amyloid beta accumulation in cognitively unimpaired older adults: Cognitive assessments provide no additional utility beyond demographic and genetic factors.,"BACKGROUND: Integrating non-invasive measures to estimate abnormal amyloid beta accumulation (Aβ+) is key to developing a screening tool for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The predictive capability of standard neuropsychological tests in estimating Aβ+ has not been quantified.
METHODS: We constructed machine learning models using six cognitive measurements alongside demographic and genetic risk factors to predict Aβ status. Data were drawn from three cohorts: Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Internal validation was conducted within A4 with external validations in ADNI and AIBL to assess model generalizability.
RESULTS: The highest area under the curve (AUC) for predicting Aβ+ was observed with demographic, genetic, and cognitive variables in A4 (median AUC = 0.745), but this was not significantly different from models without cognitive variables. External validation showed no improvement in ADNI and a slight decrease in AIBL.
DISCUSSION: Standard neuropsychological tests do not significantly enhance Aβ+ prediction in cognitively unimpaired adults beyond demographic and genetic information.
HIGHLIGHTS: Standard neuropsychological tests do not significantly improve the prediction of amyloid beta positivity (Aβ+) in cognitively unimpaired older adults beyond demographic and genetic information alone. Across three well-characterized cohorts, machine learning models incorporating cognitive measures failed to significantly improve Aβ+ prediction, indicating the limited relationship between cognitive performance on these tests and the risk of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings challenge assumptions about cognitive symptoms preceding Aβ+ screening and emphasize the need for developing more sensitive cognitive tests for early AD detection.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40110647,Exploratory analysis of the proteomic profile in plasma in adults with Down syndrome in the context of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) show increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the triplication of chromosome 21 encoding the amyloid precursor protein gene. Further, this triplication possibly contributes to dysregulation of the immune system, furthering AD pathophysiology.
METHODS: Using Olink Explore 3072, we measured ∼3000 proteins in plasma from 73 adults with DS and 15 euploid, healthy controls (HC). Analyses for differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were carried out, and pathway and protein network enrichment using Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and STRING database was investigated. Within DS, the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) feature selection was applied.
RESULTS: We identified 253 DEP between DS and HC and 142 DEP between symptomatic and asymptomatic DS. Several pathways regarding inflammatory and neurodevelopmental processes were dysregulated in both analyses. LASSO feature selection within DS returned 15 proteins as potential blood markers.
DISCUSSION: This exploratory proteomic analysis found potential new blood biomarkers for diagnosing DS-AD in need of further investigation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Inflammatory pathways are dysregulated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic DS. NFL and GFAP are confirmed as powerful biomarkers in DS with clinical and/or cognitive decline. Further circulating proteins were identified as potential blood biomarkers for symptomatic DS.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39886066,Performance and validation of a digital memory test across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Digital cognitive testing using online platforms has emerged as a potentially transformative tool in clinical neuroscience. In theory, it could provide a powerful means of screening for and tracking cognitive performance in people at risk of developing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigate whether digital metrics derived from an in-person administered, tablet-based short-term memory task-the 'What was where?' Oxford Memory Task-were able to clinically stratify patients at different points within the Alzheimer's disease continuum and to track disease progression over time. Performance of these metrics compared to traditional neuropsychological pen-and-paper screening tests of cognition was also analysed. A total of 325 people participated in this study: 49 patients with subjective cognitive decline, 57 with mild cognitive impairment, 63 with Alzheimer's disease dementia and 156 elderly healthy controls. Most digital metrics were able to discriminate between healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment and between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients. Some, including Absolute Localization Error, also differed significantly between patients with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Identification accuracy was the best predictor of hippocampal atrophy, performing as well as standard screening neuropsychological tests. A linear support vector model combining digital metrics achieved high accuracy and performed at par with standard testing in discriminating between elderly healthy controls and subjective cognitive decline (area under the curve 0.82) and between subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (area under the curve 0.92), while performing worse in classifying between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients (area under the curve 0.75). Memory imprecision was able to predict cognitive decline on standard cognitive tests over one year. Overall, these findings show how it might be possible to use a digital memory test in clinics and clinical trial contexts to stratify and track performance across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.",Brain Commun,2025
39748841,Relationship between physical activity and biomarkers of pathology and neuroinflammation in preclinical autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) has been linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, less is known about its effects in the AD preclinical stage. We aimed to investigate whether greater PA was associated with lower plasma biomarkers of AD pathology, neural injury, reactive astrocytes, and better cognition in individuals with autosomal-dominant AD due to the presenilin-1 E280A mutation who are virtually guaranteed to develop dementia.
METHODS: Twenty-eight cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (ages x̄ = 29.28) wore a FitBit Charge-4 for 14 days. We calculated their average steps to measure locomotion, and Training Impulse (TRIMP) to quantify the intensity and duration of PAs using heart rate. Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured. Cognition was assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list learning and delayed recall, Trail Making Test Part A, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-version IV Digit Span Backward. We conducted multiple linear regressions controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and education.
RESULTS: There were no associations among steps or TRIMP with plasma biomarkers or cognition. Greater TRIMP was related to higher GFAP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: PA was not associated with cognition or plasma biomarkers. However, greater intensity and duration of PAs were related to higher GFAP. Participants engaged very little in moderate to vigorous PA. Therefore, light PA may not exert a significant protective effect in preclinical AD. Future work with larger samples and longitudinal data is needed to elucidate further the potential impact of PA on AD progression in the preclinical stages.
HIGHLIGHTS: Locomotion (average steps) was not associated with plasma biomarkers or cognition.Greater training load (training impulse) was related to higher glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in mutation carriers.Light physical activity may not suffice to exert a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40047257,Genetic and pharmacologic enhancement of SUMO2 conjugation prevents and reverses cognitive impairment and synaptotoxicity in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta oligomers (Aβos) are toxic to synapses and key to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid pathology, representing a target for therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: Amyloid and small ubiquitin modifier 2 (SUMO2) transgenics were analyzed by electrophysiology and behavioral testing. A recombinant analogue of SUMO2, SBT02, was generated and assessed for brain penetration and the ability to mitigate amyloid pathology.
RESULTS: Elevated SUMO2 expression prevents cognitive and synaptic impairment in a mouse model of AD amyloid pathology. Systemic administration of SBT02 resulted in high brain bioavailability and prophylactically halted the progression of AD-associated deficits. SBT02 also restored cognition and synaptic function in late-stage amyloid load. Mechanistically, SUMO2 and SBT02 do not alter amyloid processing or clearance and mitigate synaptotoxicity in the presence of high amyloid loads.
DISCUSSION: SBT02 is a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract and reverse the toxic effects of Aβos in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Genetic overexpression of human SUMO2 prevents the long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments and cognitive deficits in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenics without affecting amyloid pathology. A recombinant analogue of human SUMO2, termed SBT02, when administered systemically, displays high brain bioavailability and has no adverse effects at high doses. Prophylactic treatment of APP transgenics with SBT02 prior to the development of amyloid pathology results in the prevention of synaptic and behavioral dysfunction. SBT02 also reverses pre-existing LTP and cognitive impairments when administered to APP transgenics with advanced and severe pathology. SBT02 has no impact on amyloid pathology, indicating a mechanism of action on synaptic resistance to Aβ toxicity.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39956967,Clinical relevance of plasma ADAM-17 with cognition and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundA disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM-17) has multiple pathophysiological functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the clinical relevance of ADAM-17 in AD is not clear yet.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the levels of circulating ADAM-17 and their association with AD.MethodsThis cross-sectional study recruited 40 normal cognition (NC) participants and 36 AD patients. Plasma ADAM-17 and biomarkers of neurodegeneration were determined. The association of plasma ADAM-17 with cognitive functions and biomarkers of neurodegeneration was analyzed.ResultsPlasma ADAM-17 levels were elevated in AD patients in comparison with NC subjects. Plasma ADAM-17 was positively associated with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, but negatively associated with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. Plasma ADAM-17 levels were positively associated with the levels of Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, and p-Tau181.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a link between ADAM-17 and the pathogenesis of AD from a clinical perspective.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40011556,Behavioral and pathological characteristics of 5xFAD female mice in the early stage.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system degenerative disease with insidious onset and gradual development caused by selective and progressive loss of neurons. The 5xFAD mouse is a relatively mature disease model of AD. However, the behavioral research on 5xFAD female mouse is more focused on the changes of late memory function, and the exploration of its early behavioral and pathological changes is still incomplete. This research aims to explore the changes in memory function, emotional function (including anxiety and depression), motor ability, amyloid plaques, glial cell response and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of female 5xFAD mice in the early stage, laying a foundation for a comprehensive exploration of the disease mechanism of AD. The results of this study found that early 4-month-old female 5xFAD mice mainly showed a decline in memory function without other dysfunction. Accompanied by a large amount of amyloid protein plaques deposited in the hippocampus, it induced the response of microglia and astrocytes, and neurogenesis decreased significantly with age, especially in early female 5xFAD mice, which resulted in a decrease in the number of new neurons. This may be an important reason for the decline in memory function of female 5xFAD mice in the early stage.",Sci Rep,2025
40183343,"Altered tear fluid protein expression in persons with mild Alzheimer's disease in proteins involved in oxidative stress, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism.","BackgroundTear fluid (TF) is a protein-rich solution that reflects pathophysiological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD).ObjectiveIn this study, we examined whether TF proteins were differently expressed in persons with mild AD dementia compared to cognitively healthy controls (CO).MethodsWe analyzed data from 53 study participants including 34 CO (mean age, 71 years; Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 28.9 ± 1.4), and 19 patients with AD (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0.5-1; mean age, 72 years; MMSE score, 23.8 ± 2.8). All participants underwent cognitive testing, as well as neurological and ophthalmological examinations. TF was collected using Schirmer strips, and TF protein content was evaluated using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and label-free quantification.ResultsWe found that 16 proteins exhibited significantly upregulated expression in the AD group compared to the CO group (p ≤ 0.05). These proteins were NP1L4, BBOX1, CYTC, RNAS4, PCD, RNT2, AL1A3, SYSC, TPIS, CLH1, PGAM1, EIF3L, 5NTC, HNRNPA2B1, PYGL, and ERO1α. No proteins were significantly downregulated in the AD group compared to the CO group.ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that TF is a potential source of biomarkers for AD. Part of those proteins with altered expression have previously linked to increased oxidative stress, changed protein synthesis, and disturbed regulation of energy metabolism related to AD or neurodegenerative disease. The present results indicate the value of continued investigation of TF proteins in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39890844,Identification of therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment using bioinformatics and machine learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that currently lacks effective treatment options. This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD using comprehensive bioinformatics methods and machine learning algorithms. By integrating differential gene expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, Mfuzz clustering, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning algorithms including LASSO regression, SVM-RFE, and random forest, five hub genes related to AD, including PLCB1, NDUFAB1, KRAS, ATP2A2, and CALM3 were identified. PLCB1, in particular, exhibited the highest diagnostic value in AD and showed significant correlation with Braak stages and neuronal expression. Furthermore, Noscapine, PX-316, and TAK-901 were selected as potential therapeutic drugs for AD based on PLCB1. This research provides a comprehensive and reliable method for the discovery of AD therapeutic targets and the construction of diagnostic models, offering important insights and directions for future AD treatment strategies and drug development.",Sci Rep,2025
39995599,Anti-amyloid treatments: Why we think they are worth it.,"UNLABELLED: Years of experience watching our patients progressively decline and die from complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has strongly motivated us to provide newly approved anti-amyloid treatments to appropriate patients. Following detailed and personalized discussions of the potential risks and benefits of these treatments with patients and their families, almost 300 patients at our clinic have chosen to receive lecanemab infusions. We have found the frequency and severity of complications, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), to be manageable and as expected based on clinical trials. While the longer-term benefits of these treatments are not yet clear, our patients and their families are accepting of even a modest slowing of disease progression. We have experienced the complexities, burdens, costs, and major logistical challenges associated with the treatment of AD with anti-amyloid treatments. However, we also understand that for some of our current patients with early symptomatic AD, anti-amyloid treatments are their best option for fighting this devastating disease, and we find it worthwhile to provide these treatments to our patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Many of our former patients have died from complications of AD.Our clinic now has nearly 300 patients receiving anti-amyloid treatments.We have found the complications of anti-amyloid treatments to be manageable.Despite the challenges, we find anti-amyloid treatments worthwhile.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40135505,MUTATE: a human genetic atlas of multiorgan artificial intelligence endophenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into imaging genetics to provide intermediate phenotypes (i.e. endophenotypes) that bridge the genetics and clinical manifestations of human disease. However, the genetic architecture of these AI endophenotypes remains largely unexplored in the context of human multiorgan system diseases. Using publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UK Biobank (UKBB), FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we comprehensively depicted the genetic architecture of 2024 multiorgan AI endophenotypes (MAEs). We comparatively assessed the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability, polygenicity, and natural selection signatures of 2024 MAEs using methods commonly used in the field. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses reveal both within-organ relationships and cross-organ interconnections. Bi-directional causal relationships were established between chronic human diseases and MAEs across multiple organ systems, including Alzheimer's disease for the brain, diabetes for the metabolic system, asthma for the pulmonary system, and hypertension for the cardiovascular system. Finally, we derived polygenic risk scores for the 2024 MAEs for individuals not used to calculate MAEs and returned these to the UKBB. Our findings underscore the promise of the MAEs as new instruments to ameliorate overall human health.

40119597,Comparison of the neuropsychological-actuarial and clinical-consensus approaches to diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in an ethnically diverse sample.,"Objective: Some studies show using neuropsychological-actuarial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) criteria may produce lower reversion rates (i.e. reverting from a cognitive diagnosis to no diagnosis) and higher associations with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers compared to conventional methods, but this has not been evaluated in a Hispanic sample. This study evaluated neuropsychological-actuarial MCI criteria performance in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) cohort compared to clinical-consensus diagnosis. Method: Data from 2,110 TARCC participants (47% Hispanic) were utilized. McNemar tests evaluated the performance of neuropsychological-actuarial versus clinical-consensus criteria in those who remained stable or converted to dementia over 3 annual visits, stratified by ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic). Chi-square analysis was used to compare frequencies of APOE ε4 allele positivity by diagnostic method. Results: Significantly more Hispanic participants were diagnosed with MCI using neuropsychological-actuarial criteria than were non-Hispanics, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 195.3, p &lt; .001, ϕ = 0.32. Hispanic participants meeting neuropsychological-actuarial MCI criteria at baseline were more likely to revert at follow-up, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 10.04, p &lt; .01, ϕ = 0.10. No differences in reversion rate were found between Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals with clinical-consensus MCI diagnoses, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.38, p = .60. There was no association between APOE ε4 allele positivity and neuropsychological-actuarial diagnosis, while there was an association for clinical-consensus diagnoses χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 15.1, p &lt; .001, ϕ = 0.09. Conclusions: In TARCC, the clinical-consensus MCI diagnostic method produced fewer cases of reversion compared to the neuropsychological-actuarial method, particularly in Hispanic participants. This is consistent with recent research investigating the use of the neuropsychological-actuarial method in African American/Black individuals. Caution is warranted when using neuropsychological-actuarial criteria among individuals with diverse backgrounds.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
39814340,Neuroprotective effects of chitinase-1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide on Alzheimer's disease by promoting lysosomal function.,"BACKGROUND: The amyloid cascade hypothesis still dominates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the acceleration of the clearance efficiency of amyloid-β (Aβ) has been always considered as an effective treatment option to slow the occurrence and progression of AD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the role of zkscan3 and its related pathways in AD of the microglia-mediated pathogenesis, and whether the combined effect of drugs can exert neuroprotective function.
METHODS: N9 mouse microglia and HT-22 mouse hippocampal neurons were randomly divided into 6 groups, qRT-PCR technique was used to detect the gene expression level of zkscan3 and the genes related to lysosome generation and function. Fourteen C57 mice were randomly divided into two groups, and drug intervention model mice were randomly selected to establish from the AD group. Transmission electron microscope was used to detect the cell status and lysosome function in the hippocampus together with the other two groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the AD model group, the gene expression of zkscan3 in the drug intervention group was downregulated, and the degree of neuronal injury in the hippocampus was reduced, the structure and number of synapses were improved, and the function of intracellular lysosome was enhanced.
CONCLUSIONS: Zkscan3 and its related genes play a vital role in the development of AD. CGRP and CHIT-1, as a combined intervention, imparts effects through zkscan3-related pathways to improve lysosomal function and exert certain neuroprotective effects.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39759397,Mapping the current trends and hotspots of extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have garnered significant attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research over the past decade, largely due to their potential in diagnostics and therapeutics. Although the investigation of EVs in AD is a relatively recent endeavor, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of this rapidly growing field has yet to be conducted.
METHODS: This study aims to elucidate and synthesize the relationship between EVs and AD, offering critical insights to guide future research and expand therapeutic possibilities. Over the past 10-15 years, substantial progress has been made in this domain. Through bibliometric techniques, this analysis assesses research performance by examining scientific publications and metrics, including productivity indicators, impact measurements, data mining, and visualization tools.
RESULTS: A total of 602 publications were analyzed using various online platforms for bibliometric analysis. Notably, the number of publications began to increase rapidly in 2018, with China and the United States emerging as leaders in this research area. The National Institute on Aging produced the highest number of publications among institutions. The Journal of Molecular Sciences and the Journal of Biological Chemistry were the most prolific and most frequently cited journals, respectively.

CONCLUSION: Research on microRNA dysregulation, oxidative stress, carboxyl-terminal fragments, small EVs, and mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs represents a critical frontier in the study of Alzheimer's disease. The role of EV-mediated neuroinflammation in AD is a focal point of ongoing investigation and will likely shape future developments in the field.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39834620,"Role of metabolic characteristics in the co-occurrence of insomnia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease: a Mendelian randomization study.","OBJECTIVE: There reportedly exists a significant comorbidity between insomnia and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), indicative of a potential link to serum metabolic dysregulation.
METHOD: To elucidate shared pathophysiological mechanisms between insomnia and AD/PD, we performed comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, investigating 1,400 serum metabolic characteristics for their causal relationships with the risks of insomnia, AD, widely defined AD (WDAD), and PD. We employed publicly available genetic data; the primary estimate was determined using inverse-variance weighting, supplemented by weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and the MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger methods to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy.
RESULTS: The ratio of N-palmitoyl-sphingosine to N-palmitoyl-sphinganine is linked to higher risks of insomnia (OR = 1.137, 95% CI = 1.015-1.273, p = 0.026) and AD (OR = 1.090, 95% CI = 1.005-1.183, p = 0.037). The acetylcarnitine to propionylcarnitine ratio is a risk factor for insomnia (OR = 1.190, 95% CI = 1.003-1.370, p = 0.016) but has protective effects against AD (OR = 0.868, 95% CI = 0.784-0.961, p = 0.006) and WDAD (OR = 0.892, 95% CI = 0.817-0.973, p = 0.010). Glutamine conjugate of C7H12O2 levels are associated with reduced risk of insomnia (OR = 0.863, 95% CI = 0.749-0.995, p = 0.042) and PD (OR = 0.856, 95% CI = 0.746-0.981, p = 0.026).

39939891,Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease subjects with expanded non-genetically modified autologous natural killer cells (SNK01): a phase I study.,"BACKGROUND: The importance of natural killer (NK) cells of the innate immune system in neurodegenerative disease has largely been overlooked despite studies demonstrating their ability to reduce neuroinflammation (thought to be mediated by the elimination of activated T cells, degradation of protein aggregates and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines). SNK01 is an autologous non-genetically modified NK cell product showing increased activity in vitro. We hypothesized that SNK01 can be safely infused to reduce neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: SNK01 was produced and characterized for its ability to eliminate activated T cells, degrade protein aggregates and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this phase 1 study, SNK01 was administered intravenously every three weeks for a total of 4 treatments using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design (1, 2 and 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells) in subjects with either mild, moderate, or severe AD (median CDR-SB 10.0). Cognitive assessments and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers associated with protein aggregation, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation including amyloid-β42 and 42/40, α-synuclein, total Tau, pTau217 and pTau181, neurofilament light, GFAP and YKL-40 analyses were performed at baseline, at 1 and 12 weeks after the last dose. The primary endpoint was safety; secondary endpoints included changes in cognitive assessments and biomarker levels.
RESULTS: In preclinical in vitro studies, SNK01 were able to uptake and degrade the protein aggregates of amyloid-β and α-synuclein, produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and eliminate activated T cells. In the phase 1 clinical study, eleven subjects were enrolled (10 evaluable). No drug-related adverse events were observed. Despite 70% of subjects being treated at relatively low doses of SNK01 (1 and 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells), 50-70% of all enrolled subjects had stable/improved CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog and/or MMSE scores and 90% had stable/improved ADCOMS at one-week after the last dose. SNK01 also appeared to have beneficial effects on protein aggregate levels and neuroinflammatory biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid, with decreases in pTau181 and GFAP appearing to be dose-dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: SNK01 was well tolerated and appeared to have clinical activity in AD while also having beneficial effects on cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuroinflammatory biomarker levels. A larger trial with a higher dosing/duration has been initiated in the USA in 2023.

40189702,Decomposing the effect of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease in brain morphological changes via learned aging templates.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects usually show more profound morphological changes with time compared to cognitively normal (CN) individuals. These changes are the combination of two major biological processes: normal aging and AD pathology. Investigating normal aging and residual morphological changes separately can increase our understanding of the disease. This paper proposes two scores, the aging score (AS) and the AD-specific score (ADS), whose purpose is to measure these two components of brain atrophy independently. For this, in the first step, we estimate the atrophy due to the normal aging of CN subjects by computing the expected deformation required to match imaging templates generated at different ages. We used a state-of-the-art generative deep learning model for generating such imaging templates. In the second step, we apply deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration to align the given image of a subject with a reference imaging template. Parametrization of this deformation field is then decomposed voxel-wise into their parallel and perpendicular components with respect to the parametrization of the expected atrophy of CN individuals in one year computed in the first step. AS and ADS are the normalized scores of these two components, respectively. We evaluated these two scores on the OASIS-3 dataset with 1,014 T1-weighted MRI scans. Of these, 326 scans were from CN subjects, and 688 scans were from subjects diagnosed with AD at various stages of clinical severity, as defined by clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores. Our results reveal that AD is marked by both disease-specific brain changes and an accelerated aging process. Such changes affect brain regions differently. Moreover, the proposed scores were sensitive to detect changes in the early stages of the disease, which is promising for its potential future use in clinical studies.

39935614,The Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) for biomarker categorization.,"UNLABELLED: Biomarkers are vital to Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development and clinical trials, and will have an increasing role in clinical care. In this narrative review, we demonstrate the use of the National Institutes on Aging/Alzheimer's Association (NIA/AA) Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) system for the categorization of biomarkers based on the primary mechanism on which they report. We show that biomarkers are available (in various levels of validation) for all CADRO processes. Application of the CADRO system demonstrates gaps in the field where novel biomarkers are needed for specific aspects of the disease, and assays to detect and measure biological changes, in individuals with symptomatic or preclinical AD. We demonstrate the CADRO system as a means of categorizing established and candidate AD biomarkers, showing the feasibility and practicality of the system. CADRO can assist with biomarker selection for AD clinical trials and drug development, and may eventually be applied to implementing biomarkers in patient care.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) system can be used to categorize biomarkers for drug development.We demonstrate the use of CADRO with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.We identified AD biomarkers in each of the CADRO categories.CADRO can be incorporated into current AD drug development and clinical trial systems.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40018519,Deciphering novel mitochondrial signatures: multi-omics analysis uncovers cross-disease markers and oligodendrocyte pathways in Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM) are severe neurological disorders that pose significant global healthcare challenges. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction, remain poorly understood. A major limitation in current studies is the lack of cell-specific markers that effectively represent mitochondrial dynamics in AD and GBM.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data using 10 machine learning algorithms to identify mitochondria-associated cell-specific markers. We validated these markers through the integration of gene expression and methylation data across diverse cell types. Our dataset comprised single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from AD patients, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from GBM patients, and additional DNA methylation and transcriptomic data from the ROSMAP, ADNI, TCGA, and CGGA cohorts.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified four significant cross-disease mitochondrial markers: EFHD1, SASH1, FAM110B, and SLC25A18. These markers showed both shared and unique expression profiles in AD and GBM, suggesting a common mitochondrial mechanism contributing to both diseases. Additionally, oligodendrocytes and their interactions with astrocytes were implicated in disease progression, particularly through the APP signaling pathway. Key hub genes, such as HS6ST3 and TUBB2B, were identified across different cellular subpopulations, highlighting a cell-specific co-expression network linked to mitochondrial function.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39931856,Tauopathy in AD: Therapeutic Potential of MARK-4.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of cognitive decline, which leads to dementia and poses significant challenges for its therapy. The reason is primarily the ineffective available treatments targeting the underlying pathology of AD. It is a neurodegenerative disease that is mainly characterised by the various molecular pathways contributing to its complex pathology, including extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. One of the crucial features is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which is facilitated by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-4 (MARK-4). The kinase plays a crucial role in the disease development by modifying microtubule integrity, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. MARK-4 is thus a druggable target and has a pivotal role in AD. Amongst MARK-4 inhibitors, 16 compounds demonstrate significant capacity in molecular docking studies, showing high binding affinity to MARK-4 and promising potential for tau inhibition. Further, in-vitro investigations provide evidence of their neuroprotective properties. The present review mainly focuses on the role of MARK-4 and its potential inhibitors used in treating AD, which have been thoroughly investigated in silico and in vitro.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
39791382,Impaired cerebral microvascular reactivity and endothelial SK channel activity in a streptozotocin-treated mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease marked by increased amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, impaired energy metabolism, and chronic ischemia-type injury. Cerebral microvascular dysfunction likely contributes to AD pathology, but its precise pathogenic role has been poorly defined.
OBJECTIVE: To examine microvascular reactivity to endothelium-dependent vasodilators and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel activity in an intracerebral streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD mouse model.
METHODS: Control and STZ-AD mice underwent Morris Water Maze and Barnes testing, after which cerebral microvascular and brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMECs) were dissected to assess microvascular reactivity, responses to SK channel activator NS309, and ion-channel current recordings using whole-cell patch clamp methodology. Control mouse cerebral microvascular and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were treated with soluble Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptide to characterize microvascular reactivity and endothelial potassium currents.
RESULTS: STZ-AD mice exhibited impaired performance vs control mice in behavioral testing. STZ-AD mice also exhibited diminished cerebral microvascular responsiveness and MBMECs potassium current augmentation in response to NS309 compared with control mice. Incubation of control mouse cerebral micro-vessels and HBMECs with soluble Aβ (1 µM) for 2 h attenuated relaxation responses to NS309 and diminished NS309-sensitive endothelial potassium currents.
CONCLUSIONS: STZ-AD mice exhibited impaired microvascular relaxation responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators; SK/IK channel dysfunction may be involved in the mechanism of this impairment. Acute treatment with Aβ produced dysregulated cerebrovascular endothelial SK/IK channels. Further elucidation of the role of microvascular dysfunction in AD is needed to prevent the chronic ischemia-type injury that contributes to cognitive decline.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39791140,A matched case-control study on polypharmacy and co-medications one year before drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. With an aging population, both AD and comorbidities are increasingly common. Managing comorbidities often requires multiple medications, leading to polypharmacy, defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate and compare the prevalence of polypharmacy one-year prior AD diagnosis compared to non-AD individuals.Methods: A matched cross-sectional design used data from the IADB.nl prescription database (1994-2021), including individuals aged 65 and older with at least one AD medication prescription within a year. Controls were matched by age and sex at a 9:1 ratio. Analyses were stratified by time period (≤2010 and &gt;2010) and further by sex and age.
RESULTS: 4150 AD individuals were included and matched with 37,350 controls. AD individuals had a higher prevalence of polypharmacy compared to controls, ≤ 2010 (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29), > 2010 (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.16-1.36). Females with AD had slightly higher odds of polypharmacy than males. The prevalence was consistent across different time periods and age groups, with the highest odds in individuals aged 65-74.
CONCLUSIONS: AD individuals in the Netherlands exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of polypharmacy in a year pre-AD diagnosis. The findings highlight the complexity of managing multiple comorbid conditions in AD individuals, emphasizing the need for regular review and optimization of medication regimens and the inclusion of non-pharmacological interventions to minimize adverse outcomes and improve quality of life.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

39801051,Effects of home-based interventions on cognitive performance in patients with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: With increasing age, dementia is a common disease in the elderly population，especially Alzheimer's disease. Owing to the nature of the disease, the function of patients deteriorates, which places a heavy burden on the country and family. Home-based training programs have been shown to improve cognitive function in patients with dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects and methods of home-based interventions on the cognitive performance of patients with dementia.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the basis of the PRISMA statement. This protocol was registered in advance at PROSPERO (CRD42021277269). Six English electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and OTseeker, were searched and updated to January 31, 2024. Two researchers independently completed the literature retrieval and data extraction. RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze the data. The standardized mean difference and the 95% confidence interval were used for statistical analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed by assessment tools, intervention duration and intervention methods.
RESULTS: Twenty randomized controlled trials with 3543 participants were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with the control intervention, the home-based intervention significantly improved cognitive performance (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI = [0.17, 0.74]; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to high evidence shows that home-based interventions significantly improve the cognitive performance of patients with dementia, especially their comprehensive cognitive function.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39893494,Rotation errors in path integration are associated with Alzheimer's disease tau pathology: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is crucial for preventive therapy development. Standard neuropsychological evaluation does not identify clinically normal individuals with brain amyloidosis, the first stage of the pathology, defined as preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Spatial navigation assessment, in particular path integration, appears promising to detect preclinical symptoms, as the medial temporal lobe plays a key role in navigation and is the first cortical region affected by tau pathology.
METHODS: We have conducted a cross-sectional study. We related the path integration performance of 102 individuals without dementia, aged over 50, to amyloid and tau pathologies, measured using positron emission tomography. We included 75 clinically normal individuals (19 with brain amyloidosis, 56 without) and 27 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (18 with brain amyloidosis, 9 without). We fitted linear mixed models to predict the path integration performances according to amyloid status or tau pathology in the medial temporal lobal, adjusting for age, gender, cognitive status, education, and video game experience. We decomposed the error into rotation and distance errors.
RESULTS: We observed that clinically normal adults with brain amyloidosis (preclinical Alzheimer's disease) had spatial navigation deficits when relying only on self-motion cues. However, they were able to use a landmark to reduce their errors. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment had deficits in path integration that did not improve when a landmark was added in the environment. The amyloid status did not influence performance among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Among all individuals, rotation, but not distance, errors increased with the level of tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that path integration performance in an environment without external cues allows identifying individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease, before overt episodic memory impairment is noticeable. Specifically, we demonstrated that poor angular estimation is an early cognitive marker of tau pathology, whereas distance estimation relates to older ages, not to Alzheimer's disease.

39767596,Exploring the Impact of Semaglutide on Cognitive Function and Anxiety-Related Behaviors in a Murine Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances, with an increasing incidence as the global population ages. This study investigates the effects of semaglutide (SEM), a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, on cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior in a transgenic murine model of AD.
METHODS: 20 mice were randomly distributed into the following groups (n = 5): (WT + VEH) group: C57BL/6J + saline, (WT + SEM) group: C57BL/6J + semaglutide, (AD + VEH) group: AD + saline, (AD + SEM) group: AD + semaglutide. The animals underwent a four-week treatment, during which we monitored blood glucose levels, body weight, and responses in an open field test, novel object recognition test, social chamber test, and 0-maze test.
RESULTS: Post-treatment, SEM significantly reduced blood glucose levels in AD mice, aligning them with those of wild-type controls. Cognitive assessments indicated an improvement in the investigation index for SEM-treated mice compared to those receiving a vehicle, suggesting cognitive benefits. Although SEM did not significantly enhance motor and exploratory activities, it displayed a potential anxiolytic effect, particularly evident in the combined anxiety index, with notable differences observed before and after treatment in the AD group.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study suggest that SEM may play a dual role in managing AD by improving glycemic control and potentially enhancing cognitive function. As the landscape of AD treatment evolves, the comprehensive approach of utilizing SEM could pave the way for innovative interventions targeting the complex interplay of metabolic and cognitive dysfunctions in this challenging neurodegenerative disorder.",Biomedicines,2024
40111918,Altered face perception in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: Evidence from representational similarity analysis of event-related potential.,"BackgroundStructural changes in medial temporal lobes including the fusiform gyrus, a critical area in face recognition, precede the progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how the neural correlates of face processing altered in aMCI, as well as their association with cognitive impairments, remain unclear.ObjectiveUsing electroencephalogram (EEG), we explored the electrophysiological markers of face-specific visual processing alterations in aMCI and examined their relationship with cognitive deficits.MethodsWe recruited participants with aMCI (n = 32) and healthy controls (HC, n = 41) and used a passive viewing task to measure the event-related potential (ERP) in response to faces and non-face objects. To compare face processing in aMCI patients and HCs, we adopted mass univariate analysis and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to explore aMCI-related alterations in ERPs.ResultsWe found that face inversion effect (FIE) in P1 amplitudes was absent in aMCI patients. Also, compared to HCs, aMCI patients exhibited a lack of right hemisphere advantage in N170 in response to faces. Furthermore, representation similarity analysis of ERP in posterior-temporal regions revealed that aMCI patients represent face and non-face objects distinctively from HCs in the early processing stage. Additionally, the FIE in P1 amplitude positively correlated to aMCI patients' visuospatial functions.ConclusionsThese findings showed aMCI-related changes in the early perceptual processing of faces and highlights the potential of the FIE in P1 amplitude and ERP patterns over occipital-temporal regions as electrophysiological markers for aMCI and AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39974360,Causal association of sex hormone-related traits with Alzheimer's disease: a multivariable and network Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Although studies have demonstrated a correlation between sex hormone-related traits [such as sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone] and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the link remains uncertain due to the intricacies of AD pathology. The study aimed to investigate the possible causal link between sex hormone-related traits and AD.
METHODS: The authors collected data from extensive genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European ancestry on sex hormone-related traits and AD. Univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to explore the possible causal relationship between these traits and AD. We used inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR as the main analysis.
RESULTS: The use of univariate MR-IVW revealed a possible causal relationship between SHBG [ORs (95% CI), 1.005 (1.001-1.009), p = 0.006], testosterone [ORs (95% CI), 0.994 (0.989-0.999), p = 0.013] and AD in female. There is no evidence of a causal association of SHBG [ORs (95% CI), 1.002 (0.999-1.005)), p = 0.237] and testosterone [ORs (95% CI), 1.000 (0.997-1.004), p = 0.810] with AD in males. Multivariate MR analysis revealed a possible direct causal connection between SHBG and testosterone in relation to females AD (SHBG-OR (95%CI), 1.005 (1.001-1.009, p = 0.023); testosterone-OR (95%CI), 0.995 (0.989-1.000, p = 0.049). Bidirectional MR analysis indicated that SHBG has a possible causal effect on testosterone (SHBG on testosterone-OR (95%CI), 1.064 (1.032-1.096), p = 0.0001). The results of the network MR analysis suggested that testosterone may act as a mediator in the causal pathway from SHBG to AD.
CONCLUSION: Our study using the MR methodology indicates that increase of SHBG level and decrease of testosterone level in females are positively linked to an increased risk of developing AD. Importantly, testosterone plays a mediating role in the causal pathway from SHBG to females AD.",Front Neurol,2025
39917815,Investigation of patterns and associations of neuroinflammation in cognitive impairment.,"Neuroinflammation has been identified as an important pathological component of cognitive impairment, and translocator protein imaging has become a valuable tool for assessing its patterns. We aimed to obtain the exact distribution of neuroinflammation in cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanisms with amyloid-beta. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, two investigators searched literature databases for studies that measured translocator protein binding levels. This measurement was performed between healthy controls and subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease via voxel-based positron emission tomography image analysis at the whole-brain level. This meta-analysis was performed with the anisotropic effect-size based algorithm. Neuroinflammation in patients with mild cognitive impairment was mainly concentrated in the left middle temporal gyrus and left amygdala. In Alzheimer's disease patients, the brain regions involved were the left inferior temporal gyrus, left calcarine fissure/surrounding cortex, left parahippocampal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus. In addition, neuroinflammation in patients with cognitive impairment was highly correlated with amyloid-beta deposition in the cortex. This study deepens our understanding of the patterns of neuroinflammation in patients with cognitive impairment and its interaction with amyloid-beta, providing potential insights for therapeutic approaches targeting neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.",Cereb Cortex,2025

We examined low test performance rates (&lt; -1 SD) in independent validation samples (n = 167 CU, n = 64 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 14 dementia). Rates were significantly different when 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not include the expected 14.7% base rate. Results: No model terms met the a priori cut-off beyond the base model, including device type, response input source (e.g. mouse, etc.), or session interference. Norms showed expected low performance rates in CU and greater rates of low performance in MCI and dementia in independent validation samples. Conclusion: Typical normative models appear appropriate for remote self-administered MTD measures and are sensitive to cognitive impairment. Device type and response input source did not explain enough variance for inclusion in normative models but are important for individual-level interpretation. Future work will increase the inclusion of individuals from under-represented groups.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
39756421,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using FusionNet with improved secretary bird optimization algorithm for optimal MK-SVM based on imaging genetic data.,"Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible central neurodegenerative disease, and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is beneficial for its prevention and early intervention treatment. In this study, we propose a novel framework, FusionNet-ISBOA-MK-SVM, which integrates a fusion network (FusionNet) and improved secretary bird optimization algorithm to optimize multikernel support vector machine for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The model leverages multimodality data, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and genetic information (single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Specifically, FusionNet employs U-shaped hierarchical graph convolutional networks and sparse graph attention networks to select feature effectively. Extensive validation using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset demonstrates the model's superior interpretability and classification performance. Compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning methods, FusionNet-ISBOA-MK-SVM achieves classification accuracies of 98.6%, 95.7%, 93.0%, 91.8%, 93.1%, and 95.4% for HC vs. AD, EMCI vs. AD, LMCI vs. AD, EMCI vs. AD, HC vs. EMCI, and HC vs. LMCI, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model identifies affected brain regions and pathogenic genes, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms and progression of Alzheimer's disease. These findings provide valuable scientific evidence to support early diagnosis and preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease.",Cereb Cortex,2025
40194208,"Muscarinic, but Not Nicotinic, Cholinergic Circuitry Is Critical for Interval Timing in Rodents (P5-3.012).","OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of muscarinic vs nicotinic cholinergic inhibition, and basal forebrain optogenetic cholinergic activation in a rodent switch timing assay.
BACKGROUND: Cholinergic deficit is a major feature in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia. Patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease can have impairments in interval timing-the ability to control movements in time. Interval timing requires attention to time and working memory for temporal rules. Our recent work showed that scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, impairs interval timing through disrupting stimulus-processing rather than temporal processing in the medial prefrontal cortex. However, the roles of muscarinic vs. nicotinic cholinergic circuitry in timing is unclear.
DESIGN/METHODS: Experiment 1: Mice (C57BL/6J, n=17, 10 males, 7 females) were well-trained on a switch timing task prior to intraperitoneal injections of: normal saline, scopolamine(2mg/kg), mecamylamine(a nicotinic receptor antagonist; 3mg/kg), physostigmine(a cholinesterase inhibitor; 0.35mg/kg) or nicotine(2mg/kg). The switch timing behavioral assay started 30 min after drug administration. All sessions were randomized and blinded. Experiment 2: A separate cohort of ChAT-Cre transgenic mice (n=4, 3 males, 1 female) were trained on the switch timing task before bilateral basal forebrain stereotactic AAV-DIO-ChR2 injection and optic canulae implantation (AP -2.35 @20°, ML +/-1.8, DV AAV injection -4.6/-5.6, DV canulae -4.6). Laser (473 nm/20 Hz) stimulation was randomly assigned on/off across trials, and switch timing behavioral assay was started 30 min after scopolamine or normal saline administration.
RESULTS: Scopolamine decreased response times (p=0.009, Cohen's D=0.7), while physostigmine increased response times (p=0.03, Cohen's D=0.7). Nicotine and mecamylamine had no effect. Scopolamine induced timing deficits were partially reversed by optogenetic activation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.
CONCLUSIONS: Muscarinic, not nicotinic, cholinergic circuitry is critical for timing behavior in a switch interval timing task. Basal forebrain cholinergic activation improves interval timing. These data have relevance for cholinergic dysfunction in human diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

40091588,Characterization of subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults with subjective cognitive decline progressing to objective cognitive impairment: A prospective 4-year follow-up study.,"BackgroundSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) is linked to a more rapid progression to the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). SCD has been correlated with affective symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Recent research aimed to shed light on the relationship between these affective symptoms and how they might correlate to a more rapid progression to objective cognitive impairment. No studies have assessed the presence, type, and intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms between SCD individuals who progressed versus those who did not.ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish whether there are differences between subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms in terms of presence, type, and intensity of symptoms presented by individuals with SCD who progressed to an objective cognitive decline.MethodsThe recruited participants originated from the Consortium for the Early Identification of Alzheimer's Disease - Québec (CIMA-Q) cohort. They were assessed twice, with an interval of 4 years separating the evaluations. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and depression symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30).ResultsThe presence, type and intensity of anxiety symptoms did not significantly distinguish the two groups. Only one type of hopelessness-related depressive symptom was significantly higher in SCD participants who had progressed to objective cognitive decline compared with those who had not.ConclusionsOur results suggest that it may be beneficial to target hopelessness in non-pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing the progression of people with SCD to MCI or AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39976100,Microglial Modulation in Alzheimer's Disease: Central Players in Neuroinflammation and Pathogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related, progressive neurodegenerative disorder of cognition with clinical features and anatomical hallmarks of amyloid-β plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles. New studies revealed that microglia, the native immune cells in the brain, are crucial in the development of AD. The present review aims at outlining various roles of microglia in AD especially targeting their role in neuroinflammation. These indicate that microglial dysfunction contributes to AD pathology by affecting both amyloid-β phagocytosis and tau hyperphosphorylation. Other investigative molecular perpetrators, including TREM2, also influence the microglial relevance to amyloid and tau, as well as the overall disease phase. The functional microglia can protect neurons, while the dysfunctional one has the capability of derailing neuronal potentials and aggravating neurodegeneration. We have also discussed therapeutic strategies that start with targeting microglia to reduce neuroinflammation and reinstate balance. However, certain problems, including the side effects of microglial modulation, cost constraint, and accessibility, are areas of concern. In this review, the author presents the current state of knowledge on the potential of microglia-targeted treatments, their risks, and benefits. Thus, this article emphasizes the importance of the expansion of research to decipher the exact manipulation of microglia in AD with the goal of applying these findings given therapeutic approaches.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
40149759,Cortico-Cortical Paired Associative Stimulation (ccPAS) in Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease: A Quali-Quantitative Approach to Potential Therapeutic Mechanisms and Applications.,"Background/Objectives: Cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose a major challenge for the ageing population, with impaired synaptic plasticity playing a central role in their pathophysiology. This article explores the hypothesis that cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can restore synaptic function by targeting impaired spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a key mechanism disrupted in AD. Methods: We reviewed existing studies investigating the effects of ccPAS on neuroplasticity in both ageing and AD populations. Results: Findings suggest age-specific effects, with ccPAS improving motor performance in young adults but showing limited efficacy in older adults, likely due to age-related declines in synaptic plasticity and cortical excitability. In AD, ccPAS studies reveal significant impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity, while long-term depression (LTD)-like mechanisms appear relatively preserved, emphasising the need for targeted neuromodulation approaches. Conclusions: Despite promising preliminary results, evidence remains limited and largely focused on motor function, with the impact of ccPAS on cognitive domains still underexplored. To bridge this gap, future research should focus on larger and more diverse cohorts to optimise ccPAS protocols for ageing and AD populations and investigate its potential for enhancing cognitive function. By refining stimulation parameters and integrating neuroimageing-based personalisation strategies, ccPAS may represent a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating neuroplasticity deficits in ageing and neurodegenerative conditions.",Brain Sci,2025
39833406,Mapping the effectiveness and risks of GLP-1 receptor agonists.,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are increasingly being used to treat diabetes and obesity. However, their effectiveness and risks have not yet been systematically evaluated in a comprehensive set of possible health outcomes. Here, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs databases to build a cohort of people with diabetes who initiated GLP-1RA (n = 215,970) and compared them to those who initiated sulfonylureas (n = 159,465), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (n = 117,989) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (n = 258,614), a control group composed of an equal proportion of individuals initiating sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 536,068), and a control group of 1,203,097 individuals who continued use of non-GLP-1RA antihyperglycemics (usual care). We used a discovery approach to systematically map an atlas of the associations of GLP-1RA use versus each comparator with 175 health outcomes. Compared to usual care, GLP-1RA use was associated with a reduced risk of substance use and psychotic disorders, seizures, neurocognitive disorders (including Alzheimer's disease and dementia), coagulation disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, infectious illnesses and several respiratory conditions. There was an increased risk of gastrointestinal disorders, hypotension, syncope, arthritic disorders, nephrolithiasis, interstitial nephritis and drug-induced pancreatitis associated with GLP-1RA use compared to usual care. The results provide insights into the benefits and risks of GLP-1RAs and may be useful for informing clinical care and guiding research agendas.",Nat Med,2025
40120783,Fibrillar amyloidosis and synaptic vesicle protein expression progress jointly in the cortex of a mouse model with β-amyloid pathology.,"Neurodegeneration, accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, and neuroinflammation are the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial association between synaptic activity, Aβ plaque load, and neuroinflammation in an Aβ mouse model with limited neurodegeneration. 26 APPSL70 and 15 C57Bl/6 mice underwent longitudinal PET-scans with [<sup>18</sup>F]UCB-H from plaque onset to levels of strong plaque load (5.3 - 11.0 months of age) to assess the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) expression, [<sup>18</sup>F]FBB to determine the fibrillar Aβ plaque load, and [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DED to assess microglial and astroglial (re)activity. Statistical parametric mapping was performed to uncover similarities between the binding patterns of all four tracers. We found a continuous increase in Aβ-PET in APPSL70 mice from 5.3 to 11.0 months of age, resulting in a significantly higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FBB PET signal in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of APPSL70 mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice at 11.0 months of age. Parallel increases in SV2A-PET signals were observed in the cortex and thalamus of APPSL70 mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice. Statistical parametric mapping revealed a similar pattern of Aβ- and SV2A-PET differences (dice coefficient 53 %). Patterns of microglia activation showed stronger congruency with SV2A expression (dice coefficient 58 %) than patterns of reactive astrogliosis (dice coefficient 26 %). APPSL70 mice with limited neurodegeneration comprise a close temporal and spatial association between SV2A expression, Aβ plaque load, and microglial activation. SV2A PET imaging in APPSL70 mice may facilitate longitudinal monitoring of increased synaptic activity in the earliest phase of AD.",Neuroimage,2025
39994993,Alzheimer's disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Current perspectives and genetic insights.,"The prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive disorder has markedly risen in recent years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands out as the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia among the elderly, featuring progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Although the exact biological causes of AD are complex and multifactorial, genetics is considered a prominent contributor. To date, around 80 genetic loci have been identified, primarily in European ancestry groups, though a considerable portion of AD's genetic architecture remains elusive. Recognizing the impending rise in AD cases, both governmental and private sectors in Saudi Arabia are making efforts to enhance formal care and services for older adults. While few studies have investigated AD-susceptible genes within the Saudi population, further attention is needed to explore the genetic background and identify molecular biomarkers associated with AD. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of AD and recent genetic research in Saudi Arabia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39762936,Neuroprotection by chronic administration of Fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM) in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM), a new Memantine (MEM) derivative, prevented amyloid-β[25-35] peptide (Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>)-induced neurotoxicity in mice, a pharmacological model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with high predictive value for drug discovery. Here, as drug infusion is likely to better reflect drug bioavailability due to the interspecies pharmacokinetics variation, we analyzed the efficacy of FENM after chronic subcutaneous (SC) infusion, in comparison with IP injections in two AD mouse models, Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-injected mice and the transgenic APP<sub>swe</sub>/PSEN1<sup>∂E9</sup> (APP/PS1) line.
METHODS: In Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-treated mice, FENM was infused at 0.03-0.3 mg/kg/day during one week after Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> injection. For comparison, FENM and MEM were administered IP daily at 0.03-0.3 mg/kg. In 10-month-old APP/PS1 mice, FENM was administered during four weeks by daily IP injections at 0.3 mg/kg or chronic SC infusion at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Memory deficits, spatial working memory and recognition memory, were analysed. Markers of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and amyloid burden in APP/PS1 mice, were quantified. Markers of synaptic plasticity such as PSD-95 and GluN2A/B/D subunits expression in hippocampus homogenates or synaptosomes were quantified in Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-treated mice and synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices was analysed in APP/PS1 mice.
RESULTS: Deficits in spontaneous alternation and object recognition in Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> mice were prevented by infused FENM at all doses tested. Similar effects were observed with the daily FENM or MEM treatments. Animals infused with 0.1 mg/kg/day FENM showed prevention of Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. FENM infusion restored Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced alterations in synaptosomal PSD-95, GluN2A and P-GluN2B levels. GluN2D levels were unchanged whatever the treatment. In APP/PS1 mice, FENM infused or administered IP alleviated spontaneous alternation deficits, neuroinflammation, increases in Aβ<sub>1-40</sub>/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and hippocampal LTP alteration.
CONCLUSION: These data confirmed the neuroprotective potential of FENM in the pharmacological Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> and transgenic APP/PS1 mouse models of AD, with a superiority to MEM, and showed that the drug can be efficiently infused chronically.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39965013,Identification of biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 by bioinformatics combining single-cell data analysis and machine learning algorithms.,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in 2019, COVID-19 has become a global epidemic. Several studies have suggested a link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and COVID-19. However, there is little research into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify key genes in COVID-19 associated with AD, and evaluate their correlation with immune cells characteristics and metabolic pathways.
METHODS: Transcriptome analyses were used to identify common biomolecular markers of AD and COVID-19. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed on gene chip datasets (GSE213313, GSE5281, and GSE63060) from AD and COVID-19 patients to identify genes associated with both conditions. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified common molecular mechanisms. The core genes were identified using machine learning. Subsequently, we evaluated the relationship between these core genes and immune cells and metabolic pathways. Finally, our findings were validated through single-cell analysis.
RESULTS: The study identified 484 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by taking the intersection of genes between AD and COVID-19. The black module, containing 132 genes, showed the highest association between the two diseases according to WGCNA. GO enrichment analysis revealed that these genes mainly affect inflammation, cytokines, immune-related functions, and signaling pathways related to metal ions. Additionally, a machine learning approach identified eight core genes. We identified links between these genes and immune cells and also found a association between EIF3H and oxidative phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies shared genes, pathways, immune alterations, and metabolic changes potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and AD.",PLoS One,2025
39865007,Gender differences in cognitive impairment among the elderly in rural West Texas counties.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in the elderly population has been increasing both nationally and globally. Males and females are impacted differently when it comes to cognitive health, and this can be influenced by various risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: This study highlights the sociodemographic, chronic disease, and genetic biomarker risk factors associated with gender differences and cognitive impairments in the elderly population living in Cochran, Parmer, and Bailey counties of rural West Texas.
METHODS: Cross tabulation, Pearson's chi-squared, two sample proportions, binary logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression were utilized to analyze data. SPSS software was used to detect significant risk factors.
RESULTS: Using a bivariate logistic regression, the age group 70 and above of males and females for the Cochran and Parmer counties was found significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Anxiety, depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment in females in Parmer County. Gender differences were observed in Cochran County for smoking but females in Bailey County were found to be more tobacco-dependent compared to other counties. However, in Cochran County the prevalence of cognitive impairment with rates of 66% for males and 70% for females was observed to be significantly lower in hypertensive group who consumed modified diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender-based disparities in cognitive impairment are essential for gaining more insights into Alzheimer's disease or dementia prevention and advancement of healthcare and medical approaches in the underserved rural communities of West Texas.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40156282,Primary care preparedness to care for patients with ADRD: A national survey study.,"INTRODUCTION: It is unknown how prepared primary care practices are to deliver recommended dementia care.
METHODS: A nationally representative survey of US primary care practices focused on care delivery processes, including those for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
RESULTS: A total of 1245 of 3498 practices (36%) responded. Most practices reported systems to detect patients with ADRD (67%) and refer patients for diagnostic testing (75%). Fewer required ADRD-related training (45%-46%) or maintained an ADRD registry (29%). Practices that scored higher on ADRD care preparedness were more likely to be smaller, receive a higher proportion of revenue from Medicare, and have other important practice capabilities.
DISCUSSION: Primary care practices have mixed preparedness to care for patients with ADRD. Efforts to boost ADRD preparedness, including providing adequate infrastructure and resources directly to primary care, should be a priority to address disparities in diagnosis and to optimize the patient and caregiver journey.
HIGHLIGHTS: Mixed ADRD preparedness identified in primary care practices across the United States. Practices often lack ADRD-specific registries and staff training initiatives. Medicare-reliant and larger physician-owned groups show higher ADRD preparedness. FQHCs reported lower ADRD preparedness, highlighting potential gaps in care. Cultural awareness and other support services correlate with better ADRD readiness.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39730537,Amelioration of cognition by hesperidin-conjugated cobalt oxide nanoparticles.,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the metabolic syndromes that is associated with cognitive deficit, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) like pathology due to impaired insulin-signalling in the brain, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nanotechnology is one of the most promising techniques for targeting the brain. However, the toxicity of metal nanoparticles is one of the biggest challenges to be studied. In this study, cobalt oxide nanoparticles are conjugated to a bioflavonoid, hesperidin, a natural antioxidant. The study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the cobalt oxide conjugated hesperidin in the diabetes-induced cognitive deficit rat model. The neuropharmacological behaviour, in-vivo antioxidant status and level of acetylcholinesterase, nitrite, amyloid β, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined for cobalt oxide conjugated hesperidin and compared with bare cobalt oxide nanoparticles and hesperidin. The cobalt oxide conjugated hesperidin significantly improved learning and memory in the streptozotocin rat model. However, further studies are required to establish a cellular and molecular mechanism involved in the neuroprotective activity of cobalt oxide-conjugated hesperidin.",Sci Rep,2024
40095345,Exosomes as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Agents in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Future Directions.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS rank among the most challenging global health issues, marked by substantial obstacles in early diagnosis and effective treatment. Current diagnostic techniques frequently demonstrate inadequate sensitivity and specificity, whilst conventional treatment strategies encounter challenges related to restricted bioavailability and insufficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Recently, exosomes-nanoscale vesicles packed with proteins, RNAs, and lipids-have emerged as promising agents with the potential to reshape diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these diseases. Unlike conventional drug carriers, they naturally traverse the BBB and can deliver bioactive molecules to affected neural cells. Their molecular cargo can influence cell signaling, reduce neuroinflammation, and potentially slow neurodegenerative progression. Moreover, exosomes serve as non-invasive biomarkers, enabling early and precise diagnosis while allowing real-time disease monitoring. Additionally, engineered exosomes, loaded with therapeutic molecules, enhance this capability by targeting diseased neurons and overcoming conventional treatment barriers. By offering enhanced specificity, reduced immunogenicity, and an ability to bypass physiological limitations, exosome-based strategies present a transformative advantage over existing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This review examines the multifaceted role of exosomes in NDDs, emphasizing their diagnostic capabilities, intrinsic therapeutic functions, and transformative potential as advanced treatment vehicles.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39952976,Reducing inference cost of Alzheimer's disease identification using an uncertainty-aware ensemble of uni-modal and multi-modal learners.,"While multi-modal deep learning approaches trained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) data have shown promise in the accurate identification of Alzheimer's disease, their clinical applicability is hindered by the assumption that both modalities are always available during model inference. In practice, clinicians adjust diagnostic tests based on available information and specific clinical contexts. We propose a novel MRI- and FDG PET-based multi-modal deep learning approach that mimics clinical decision-making by incorporating uncertainty estimates of an MRI-based model (generated using Monte Carlo dropout and evidential deep learning) to determine the necessity of an FDG PET scan, and only inputting the FDG PET to a multi-modal model when required. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on FDG PET scans, which are costly and expose patients to radiation. Our approach reduces the need for FDG PET by up to 92% without compromising model performance, thus optimizing resource use and patient safety. Furthermore, using a global model explanation technique, we provide insights into how anatomical changes in brain regions-such as the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and ventricles-can positively or negatively influence the need for FDG PET scans in alignment with clinical understanding of Alzheimer's disease.",Sci Rep,2025
40073856,The annual incidence of vascular dementia and other dementias: A population-based study in Eastern Finland.,"INTRODUCTION: Considering the globally growing population and the rising incidence of dementia, it is important to understand the proportion of dementia cases affected by vascular brain disease. We aimed to study the incidence of vascular dementia (VD) and other dementias in a defined population in Finland to better understand VD's contribution to the total incidence of dementias and to assess the sensitivity of their diagnostics.
METHODS: We aimed to collect all dementia diagnoses made in Northern Savo, Finland, in 2020. The memory disorder diagnoses were identified using the International Classification Codes 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses codes. Finally, we studied the diagnoses in relation to demographic data, focusing on VD.
RESULTS: The total number of new diagnoses of dementia with a vascular component or vascular alone was 202, with 20 cases attributable to pure VD. The annual incidence of dementias with a vascular component in Northern Savo was 81.4 per 100,000 across the population and 310.8 per 100,000 in the age group of  65. In our study population, 23.8% of all incident dementia cases were associated with vascular disease.
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, dementia associated with vascular pathology has the second highest incidence after Alzheimer's disease (AD), while pure VD is rarely diagnosed. Our findings align with previous international studies and a recent national registry study. Future studies with a prospective study setting, potentially incorporating extensive neuroimaging, would be critical in further understanding the epidemiology of VD.",Neuroepidemiology,2025
39815261,SIRT2 and ALDH1A1 as critical enzymes for astrocytic GABA production in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with drastically altered astrocytic metabolism. Astrocytic GABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are associated with memory impairment in AD and synthesized through the Monoamine Oxidase B (MAOB)-mediated multi-step degradation of putrescine. However, the enzymes downstream to MAOB in this pathway remain unidentified.
METHODS: Using transcriptomics analysis, we identified two candidate enzymes, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) and Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) for the steps following MAOB in the astrocytic GABA production pathway. We used immunostaining, metabolite analysis and electrophysiology, both in vitro and in vivo, to confirm the participation of these enzymes in astrocytic GABA production. We checked for the presence of SIRT2 in human AD patients as well as the mouse model APP/PS1 and finally, we selectively ablated SIRT2 in the astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice to observe its effects on pathology.
RESULTS: Immunostaining, metabolite analysis, and electrophysiology recapitulated the participation of ALDH1A1 and SIRT2 in GABA production. Inhibition of SIRT2 reduced the production of astrocytic GABA but not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a key molecule in neurodegeneration. Elevated expression of these enzymes was found in hippocampal astrocytes of AD patients and APP/PS1 mice. Astrocyte-specific gene-silencing of SIRT2 in APP/PS1 mice restored GABA production and partially improved memory function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to identify the specific role of SIRT2 in reactive astrogliosis and determine the specific pathway and metabolic step catalyzed by the enzyme. We determine the partial, yet significant role of ALDH1A1 in this process, thereby highlighting 2 new players the astrocytic GABA production pathway. Our findings therefore, offer SIRT2 as a new tool to segregate GABA from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, aiding future research in neurodegenerative diseases.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40022196,Locus coeruleus tau validates and informs high-resolution MRI in aging and at earliest Alzheimer's pathology stages.,"The locus coeruleus (LC) has been identified as a site that develops phosphorylated tau pathology earlier than cerebral cortex. We present data using high-resolution postmortem MRI and validated tau histopathology in controls and the earliest Braak and Braak (BB) stages (BBI-BBII) in LC. The high-resolution ex vivo MRI provides a 3D volume (quantitative), while the histology reveals tau specificity and severity burden (semi-quantitative). We mapped our highly regionally specific LC data onto high-resolution 3D MRI reconstructions of the same samples used in histology (n = 11). We noted significant structural subatrophy between BB 0 and II (30.0% smaller volumes, p = 0.0381), a trend which primarily affected the rostral-most LC (49.2% smaller average volume, p = 0.0381). We show histopathology data on both the LC and neighboring dorsal raphe caudal (DRc), which were assessed at multiple rostrocaudal levels and mapped with highly sensitive tau severity spatial matrices. We observed significant LC tau accumulation between BB I and II (37.6% increase, p < 0.0001), which may reflect pathology change prior to presumptive cognitive impairment at BB III. Tau pathology was most severe in the middle portion of the LC (11.3% greater compared to rostral LC, p = 0.0289) when including BB III. We noted a significant rostrocaudal gradient of DRc tau severity (58.2% decrease between rostral and caudal DRc, p < 0.0001), suggesting selective regional vulnerabilities of both nuclei. Our study represents a rigorous approach to investigating LC and DRc pathology, having multiple histology sections per sublevel and high-resolution MRI to measure the whole LC, without missing slices in a histological only approach. Taken together, our findings provide novel validated data that demonstrate the tau pathology occurring in the LC and DRc during preclinical AD stages, and alongside spatial reconstructions that will serve as valuable references for in vivo LC imaging.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
40183347,The effect of hippocampal subfield volumes on cognitive decline and incident dementia in a memory clinic cohort.,"BackgroundThe hippocampus plays a central role in cognition and hippocampal atrophy is a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Evidence has suggested associations between hippocampal subfield volumes and specific cognitive domains and dementia risk. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the role of hippocampal subfield volumes in cognitive decline across different domains over time.ObjectiveWe investigated associations between hippocampal subfield volumes and changes in cognitive domains together with incident dementia in a memory clinic cohort.MethodsAssociations between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive decline over three years (n = 443) were analyzed using generalized estimating equations, and associations with incident dementia (n = 283) using multiple logistic regression.ResultsAt baseline, all hippocampal subfield volumes were associated with diagnosis of dementia, while the CA4-dentate gyrus, molecular layer, subicular complex, and fimbria volumes were associated with diagnosis of CIND. Over three years, all subfields except the hippocampal fissure were associated with memory. Decreased molecular layer (OR:2.26, 95%CI:1.50;3.50) size was associated with increased risk of dementia.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that hippocampal atrophy of the cornu ammonis, CA4-dentate gyrus, and molecular layer may first manifest with cognitive impairment in memory before other subfields of the hippocampus, and that molecular layer volume may be an early biomarker of dementia. Further research demonstrating the biological role of hippocampal subfields in specific cognitive domains is required.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

METHODS: We conducted neuropathological analyses on human AD post mortem brain tissues and 5xFAD transgenic mice. We developed PB94, a brain-permeable HDAC11-selective inhibitor, and assessed its effects using live-animal imaging and behavioral studies.
RESULTS: HDAC11 was significantly upregulated in AD brains, correlating with amyloid pathology and neuroinflammatory markers. PB94 treatment reduced amyloid burden and neuroinflammation, improving cognitive function in 5xFAD mice.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight HDAC11 as a promising drug target for AD. PB94's ability to reduce amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation suggests its potential as an effective therapeutic. This study supports further exploration of HDAC11 inhibition as a treatment strategy for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Histone deacetylase-11 (HDAC11) is significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and colocalizes with amyloid pathology and neuroinflammatory markers. Novel brain-permeable HDAC11-selective inhibitor PB94 demonstrates promising therapeutic potential for AD treatment. PB94 treatment reduces amyloid burden and neuroinflammation in AD mouse models, confirmed by live imaging studies. HDAC11 inhibition enhances microglial phagocytosis of amyloid beta proteins and modulates inflammatory cytokine levels. PB94 treatment improves cognitive function in AD mouse models while showing favorable brain penetration and selectivity.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40042504,Dynamic lifetime risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease with longitudinal cognitive assessment measurements.,"INTRODUCTION: The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the importance of predicting lifetime risk and updating assessments as new data emerge. This study aimed to develop a dynamic model using longitudinal cognitive assessments for updated risk predictions.
METHODS: This study used data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) to develop a dynamic risk prediction model based on five cognitive domains, updated annually over 10 years.
RESULTS: The lifetime prediction models based on 2384 participants showed improved area under the curve (AUC) over time, rising from 0.578 at baseline to 0.765 with 10 years of data. The models predicting AD onset before ages 85 and 90 showed superior performance, with AUCs increasing from 0.761 to 0.932 and 0.658 to 0.876, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Incorporating longitudinal cognitive assessments improves AD risk prediction as more data become available. Future research should integrate diverse data types to further boost predictive accuracy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Developed a dynamic lifetime risk prediction model. The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.578 at baseline to 0.765 with 10 years of data. The models predicting pre-85 and pre-90 risks demonstrated superior performance.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39714256,The early-onset Alzheimer's disease MRI signature: a replication and extension analysis in early-stage AD.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is less investigated than the more common late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) despite its more aggressive course. A cortical signature of EOAD was recently proposed and may facilitate EOAD investigation. Here, we aimed to validate this proposed MRI biomarker of EOAD neurodegeneration in an Appalachian clinical cohort. We also compared differences in EOAD signature atrophy in participants with biomarker-positive EOAD, LOAD, early-onset non-AD pathologies, and cognitively normal individuals. Cortical thinning was reliably detected in eight of nine signature areas of persons with EOAD relative to cognitively normal individuals despite very early disease stage. Additionally, individuals with EOAD showed thinner cortex in most signature regions relative to those with early-onset non-AD pathologies. EOAD and LOAD showed similar cortical atrophy within most EOAD signature regions. Whole-brain vertex-wise cortical analyses supported these findings. Furthermore, signature cortical atrophy showed expected relationships with measures of global and specific cognitive and functional status. This investigation further validates and expands upon the recently defined EOAD signature and suggests its robustness within a rural population, even at early disease stage. Larger scale and longitudinal studies employing this marker of EOAD neurodegeneration are needed to further understand clinical effects and appropriate management of persons with EOAD.",Cereb Cortex,2024
40163534,Efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapies targeting amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: While recently U.S. FDA-approved anti-amyloid beta (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer new treatment approaches for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), these medications also carry potential safety concerns and uncertainty about their efficacy for improving cognitive function. This study presents an updated meta-analysis of cognitive outcomes and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs from phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with sporadic AD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled blinded trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anti-Aβ mAbs in patients with AD were identified through a search in clinical trials.gov, PubMed and Embase on January 14th, 2024. The retrieved studies were further screened from January 15th, 2024, to February 14th, 2024. We included studies that had been published in any language. Quality of trials was assessed using the Jadad score and publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and Funnel plot. Primary outcomes were mean changes from baseline to post-treatment in Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores, and secondary outcomes were adverse events including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E), and ARIA with hemorrhage (ARIA-H). Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were conducted. The literature search identified 13 phase III RCTs, which included 18,826 patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Compared with placebo, treatment with mAbs significantly improved cognitive performance on CDR-SB (mean difference -0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.38, -0.11]) and ADAS-Cog (standardized mean difference -0.09, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.06]), in which a negative change indicates improvement for both scores. Meta-regression analysis suggested that trials enrolling patients with early-stage AD were associated with better efficacy. Elevated risk of ARIA-E (risk ratio [RR] 9.79, 95% CI [5.32,18.01]), ARIA-H (RR 1.94, 95% CI [1.47,2.57]), and headaches (RR 1.21, 95% CI [1.10,1.32]) were noted. Statistical heterogeneity was relatively high for ARIA-E and ARIA-H, leading to wide confidence intervals and considerable variability in effect sizes, though meta-regression was conducted to address this. Furthermore, differences in trial designs introduce limitations in cross-trial comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Aβ mAb therapy slows cognitive decline, but with small effect sizes, and raises potential concerns about ARIA and headaches.",PLoS Med,2025
39948350,"Molecular interactions, structural effects, and binding affinities between silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) and amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides.","Because silver is toxic to microbes, but not considered toxic to humans, the metal has been used as an antimicrobial agent since ancient times. Today, silver nanoparticles and colloidal silver are used for antibacterial purposes, and silver-peptide and similar complexes are being developed as therapeutic agents. Yet, the health effects of silver exposure are not fully understood, nor are the molecular details of silver-protein interactions. In Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia worldwide, amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides aggregate to form soluble oligomers that are neurotoxic. Here, we report that monovalent silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) bind wildtype Aβ<sub>40</sub> peptides with a binding affinity of 25 ± 12 µM in MES buffer at 20 °C. Similar binding affinities are observed for wt Aβ<sub>40</sub> peptides bound to SDS micelles, for an Aβ<sub>40</sub>(H6A) mutant, and for a truncated Aβ(4-40) variant containing an ATCUN (Amino Terminal Cu and Ni) motif. Weaker Ag<sup>+</sup> binding is observed for the wt Aβ<sub>40</sub> peptide at acidic pH, and for an Aβ<sub>40</sub> mutant without histidines. These results are compatible with Ag<sup>+</sup> ions binding to the N-terminal segment of Aβ peptides with linear bis-his coordination. Because the Ag<sup>+</sup> ions do not induce any changes in the size or structure of Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers, we suggest that Ag<sup>+</sup> ions have a minor influence on Aβ toxicity.",Sci Rep,2025
40176122,Effects of 52 weeks of precuneus rTMS in Alzheimer's disease patients: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus (PC) is emerging as a new non-invasive therapeutic approach in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we sought to investigate the effects of 52 weeks of rTMS applied over the PC on cognitive functions in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD were enrolled for the study. Of those 31 patients were extended to 52 weeks after being included in a 24-week trial (NCT03778151) with the same experimental design. The trial included a 52-week treatment with a 2-week intensive course where rTMS (or sham) was applied over the PC daily (5 times per week, Monday to Friday), followed by a 50-week maintenance phase in which the same stimulation was applied once weekly. Personalization of rTMS treatment was established using neuronavigated TMS in combination with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 52 of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary outcomes included score changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)<sub>11</sub>, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Changes in cortical activity and connectivity were monitored by TMS-EEG.
RESULTS: Among 48 patients randomized (mean age 72.8 years; 56% women), 32 (68%) completed the study. Repetitive TMS of the PC (PC-rTMS) had a significant effect on the primary outcome measure. The estimated mean change in CDR-SB after 52 week was 1.36 for PC-rTMS (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 2.04]) and 2.45 for sham-rTMS group (95%CI [1.85, 3.05]). There were also significant effects for the secondary outcomes ADAS-Cog<sub>11</sub>, ADCS-ADL and NPI scores. Stronger DMN connectivity at baseline was associated with favorable response to rTMS treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-two weeks of PC-rTMS may slow down the impairment of cognitive functions, activities of daily living and behavioral disturbances in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Further multicenter studies are needed to confirm the clinical potential of DMN personalized rTMS.

40046336,The role of microglia in the prion-like transmission of protein aggregates in neurodegeneration.,"Numerous neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis share a neuropathological hallmark: aberrant protein aggregation in the CNS. Microglia, the brain's innate immune cells, also play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Multiple studies indicate that these pathological aggregates can propagate throughout the brain in a prion-like manner. A protein/peptide that adopts a prion-like conformation can induce homologous proteins to misfold into a prion-like conformation through templated seeding, enabling cell-to-cell spread and accelerating protein aggregation throughout the brain. Two important questions in the prion-like paradigm are where the prion-like misfolding occurs and how the prion-like aggregates are spread throughout the CNS. Here, we review the role of microglia and associated inflammation in the prion-like spread of pathologically aggregated proteins/peptides in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing body of evidence suggests that microglia can internalize prion-like proteins and transport them to neighbouring neurons and other glial cells. Microglia may also influence the potential seeding of proteins in neurons and induce inflammatory pathways in their microenvironment. This review aims to broaden the understanding of the role of microglia in the prion-like spread of protein aggregation.",Brain Commun,2025
39772982,The association of high-density lipoprotein cargo proteins with brain volume in older adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC).,"BACKGROUND: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) modulates the blood-brain barrier and cerebrovascular integrity, likely influencing the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify HDL protein cargo associated with brain amyloid deposition and brain volume in regions vulnerable to AD pathology in older adults.
METHODS: HDL was separated from the plasma of 65 non-demented participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using a fast protein liquid chromatography method. HDL cargo proteins were measured using a label-free, untargeted proteomic method based on mass spectrometry and data-independent acquisition. Linear regression with multiple imputations assessed the associations between each HDL cargo protein (log2-transformed) and brain amyloid deposition or temporal-parietal meta-ROI volume, adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 76.3 (5.4) years old, 53.8% (35/65) female, 30.8% (20/65) black, and 28.1% (18/64, 1 missing) APOE4 carriers. We found few HDL cargo proteins associated with brain amyloid deposition and considerably more HDL cargo proteins associated with temporal-parietal meta-ROI volume. Two HDL cargo proteins mostly associated with temporoparietal meta-ROI volume were fibrinogen B (FGB) and plasminogen (PLG). A doubling of FGB in HDL was associated with a greater temporoparietal meta-ROI volume of 1638 mm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI [688, 2589]). In comparison, a doubling of PLG in HDL was associated with a lower temporoparietal meta-ROI of 2025 mm<sup>3</sup> (95% CI [-3669, -1034]).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HDL cargo proteins associated with temporal-parietal meta-ROI volume are involved in complement and coagulation pathways.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

We performed lifespan analyses of male and female AD mouse models (APP/PS1 and APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup>) and their shared genetic background control (C57BL/6). Survival curves support significant sex differences between genotypes. Minimal longevity revealed increased age in male APP/PS1, and decreased age in male APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mice. Maximal longevity revealed an increased average age in males. Furthermore, median lifespan differed between sex and genotype. This study supports dimorphic survival in two mouse models of AD, emphasizing the need to examine mechanisms and treatments in both sexes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39719704,A neurodegenerative cellular stress response linked to dark microglia and toxic lipid secretion.,"The brain's primary immune cells, microglia, are a leading causal cell type in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, the mechanisms by which microglia can drive neurodegeneration remain unresolved. Here, we discover that a conserved stress signaling pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), characterizes a microglia subset with neurodegenerative outcomes. Autonomous activation of ISR in microglia is sufficient to induce early features of the ultrastructurally distinct ""dark microglia"" linked to pathological synapse loss. In AD models, microglial ISR activation exacerbates neurodegenerative pathologies and synapse loss while its inhibition ameliorates them. Mechanistically, we present evidence that ISR activation promotes the secretion of toxic lipids by microglia, impairing neuron homeostasis and survival in vitro. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of ISR or lipid synthesis mitigates synapse loss in AD models. Our results demonstrate that microglial ISR activation represents a neurodegenerative phenotype, which may be sustained, at least in part, by the secretion of toxic lipids.",Neuron,2025
39924849,Analysis of the causal relationship between five chosen factors and early-onset Alzheimer's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore the causal relationship between five selected factors-lysosome, migrasomes, macrophage, fibroblast, and endothelium cell-and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) through related genes, providing clues for EOAD research.
METHODS: Using genes related to the five selected factors as exposure variables and EOAD as the disease outcome, significant genes were screened through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, based on the OpenGWAS database. The selected genes were intersected with genes related to the exposure factors to assess the causal relationships between the five factors and EOAD.
RESULTS: MR analysis identified 13 genes in total. Six of these genes were protective factors for EOAD, with LYST being the most significant (OR = 0.4259, 95% CI: 0.2218-0.8178, p = 0.0103). Seven genes were risk factors for EOAD, with NCF4 being the most significant (OR = 2.7207, 95% CI: 1.0229-7.2362, p = 0.0449). A total of 1925 genes related to lysosome, migrasomes, macrophage, fibroblast, and endothelium cell were analyzed. After intersection, 10 lysosome-related genes (NCF4, VIPAS39, LYST, SORT1, ARSB, EPDR1, SYNGR1, ANXA11, PYGB, CLN5) and 3 endothelium cell -related genes (ADM, NFIB, NKTR) were found to have significant causal relationships with EOAD.
CONCLUSIONS: There are genes related to lysosome and endothelium cell that have significant relationships with EOAD, while no causal relationships were found between migrasomes, macrophage, fibroblast, and EOAD.

40194635,"Differential involvement of neurotransmitter pathways in AD, bvFTD and MCI: Whole-brain MRI analysis.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are a growing public health challenge, with dementia incidence projected to triple in the coming decades. AD is associated with memory impairment, bvFTD with behavioral dysfunction, and MCI as a transitional stage between normal cognition and dementia. While structural brain changes have been widely studied, the role of neurotransmitter pathways remains underexplored. This study aims to correlate gray matter atrophy in AD, bvFTD, and MCI with neurotransmitter pathways to identify distinctive neurochemical impairments.
METHODS: We included 214 participants (89 CE, 74 bvFTD, 51 MCI) from a single-center cohort. MRI from 3 T scanners was segmented via FreeSurfer. Neurotransmitter maps were sourced from JuSpace. We performed volumetric and whole-brain correlation analyses to evaluate relationships between brain regional volumes (BRVs) and neurotransmitter pathways. Group differences were assessed with Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc analyses.
RESULTS: Volumetric analysis showed expected atrophy patterns in each group. Correlation analysis indicated distinct neurotransmitter involvement: AD showed significant atrophy correlations with dopamine D2 and GABA A receptor distribution; bvFTD had significant negative correlations with the mu-opioid receptor; MCI exhibited early serotonergic dysregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified distinct atrophy patterns linked to specific neurotransmitter systems, each showing unique neurochemical profiles. In AD, precuneus and inferior parietal lobules atrophy aligns with dopaminergic and GABAergic receptors, potentially impacting memory and executive functions. In bvFTD, medial orbitofrontal and temporal atrophy, is linked to mu-opioid receptor impairment, possibly contributing to behavioral symptoms. In MCI, early serotonergic dysregulation involving SERT occurs before detectable atrophy.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39821594,White matter hyperintensities and TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Greater white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are seen with transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). WMH associations with TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD-TDP) remain unclear.
METHODS: A total of 157 participants from Mayo Clinic Rochester with autopsy-confirmed AD, known TDP-43 status, and antemortem fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI were included. Vascular risk factors were assessed. A semi-automated WMH segmentation-quantification process produced total and regional WMH volumes. Penalized linear regression models adjusting for age at MRI analyzed TDP-43 associations (status and typing) with WMHs.
RESULTS: TDP-43-positive status was not associated with WMH burden overall because opposite effects were seen based on AD-TDP typing. Despite similar antemortem vascular risk factors and postmortem vascular pathologies, AD-TDP type-α showed greater total and regional WMH burden (particularly in subcortical frontotemporal and basal ganglia regions) than TDP-43 negatives and AD-TDP type-β.
DISCUSSION: AD-TDP types may have different WMH pathomechanisms, with type-α having associations more like FTLD-TDP than AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: In transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD-TDP), TDP-43 status alone is not associated with total or regional WMH burden AD-TDP type-α shows greater total, frontotemporal subcortical, and basal ganglia white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) AD-TDP type-β shows less total and subcortical occipital WMHs AD-TDP type-α effect on WMH burden closely mimics the effects of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) rather than AD Different relationships of AD-TDP types with WMHs suggest different pathomechanisms.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39801125,Efficacy of music-based intervention for people living with dementia in an inpatient setting: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia is of limited benefit. The addition of non-pharmacological interventions is often essential for optimal symptom control. Music is a viable way to help patients communicate and improve their quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to find the most effective way to use music in a busy dementia ward.
METHODS: 17 inpatients (aged 63-93 years) with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and dementia took part over five weeks. Music lyrics presented via free-field speakers were individualized to personal preferences. Instruments (e.g., maracas) were used in some group sessions. We used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Music in Dementia Assessment Scales (MiDAS) to evaluate patients' behavior before and after musical intervention.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean NPI-Q scores before and after the music intervention. Specifically, Delusion, Motor Disturbances, and Agitation scores were significantly reduced after music intervention. This was accompanied by significant improvements in Interest, Response, and Enjoyment of MiDAS items during specific intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical professionals can successfully deliver music-based intervention to inpatients with advanced dementia to help manage their behavioral symptoms in the short term. Music-based interventions' use for inpatient wards must be further investigated as an economical and personalized non-pharmacological therapeutic tool for patients with dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39752365,Tau phosphorylation suppresses oxidative stress-induced mitophagy via FKBP8 receptor modulation.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal tau phosphorylation disrupts mitophagy, a quality control process through which damaged organelles are selectively removed from the mitochondrial network. The precise mechanism through which this occurs remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tau which has been mutated at Thr-231 to glutamic acid to mimic an Alzheimer's-relevant phospho-epitope expressed early in disease selectively inhibits oxidative stress-induced mitophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we use immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines to extend that result into mammalian cells. Specifically, we show that phosphomimetic tau at Ser-396/404 (EC) or Thr-231/Ser-235 (EM) partly inhibits mitophagy induction by paraquat, a potent inducer of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Moreover, a combination of immunologic and biochemical approaches demonstrates that the levels of the mitophagy receptor FKBP8, significantly decrease in response to paraquat in cells expressing EC or EM tau mutants, but not in cells expressing wildtype tau. In contrast, paraquat treatment results in a decrease in the levels of the mitophagy receptors FUNDC1 and BNIP3 in the presence of both wildtype tau and the tau mutants. Interestingly, FKBP8 is normally trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum during oxidative stress induced mitophagy, and our results support a model where this trafficking is impacted by disease-relevant tau, perhaps through a direct interaction. We provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and highlight FKBP8 receptor as a potential target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",PLoS One,2025
40185767,A fine-tuned convolutional neural network model for accurate Alzheimer's disease classification.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the primary causes of dementia in the older population, affecting memories, cognitive levels, and the ability to accomplish simple activities gradually. Timely intervention and efficient control of the disease prove to be possible through early diagnosis. The conventional machine learning models designed for AD detection work well only up to a certain point. They usually require a lot of labeled data and do not transfer well to new datasets. Additionally, they incur long periods of retraining. Relatively powerful models of deep learning, however, also are very demanding in computational resources and data. In light of these, we put forward a new way of diagnosing AD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and transfer learned convolutional neural networks (CNN). Transfer learning makes it easier to reduce the costs involved in training and improves performance because it allows the use of models which have been trained previously and which generalize very well even when there is very little training data available. In this research, we used three different pre-trained CNN based architectures (AlexNet, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2) each implemented with several solvers (e.g. Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent or SGD, and Root Mean Square Propagation or RMSprop). Our model achieved impressive classification results of 99.4% on the Kaggle MRI dataset as well as 98.2% on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. Such results serve to demonstrate how transfer learning is an effective solution to the issues related to conventional models that limits the accuracy of diagnosis of AD, thus enabling their earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This would in turn benefit the patients by improving the treatment management and providing insights on the disease progression.",Sci Rep,2025
39711484,Examination of MGMT as a risk gene for dementia in the Amish.,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) locus was proposed as influencing the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women who did not carry the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. We examined an Amish founder population for any influence of genetic variation in and around the MGMT locus on the risk for dementia.
METHODS: Genetic association was performed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) surrounding the MGMT locus. A total of 946 individuals of Amish descent between the ages of 76 and 95 who were classified as cognitively impaired or cognitively unimpaired were included. Multiple statistical models were applied to test for replication.
RESULTS: The results for the previously associated individual SNPs were not significant. However, a different SNP (rs7909468) generated significant results under a model different from the previous report.
DISCUSSION: The MGMT locus may influence the risk of AD, although its genetic mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further study.
HIGHLIGHTS: Association analyses around the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) locus showed a study-significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs7909468, in a female cognitively impaired group lacking the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. Functional implications of rs7909468 are relatively unexplored, but in silico analyses indicate it may regulate MGMT expression. rs7909468 was not in linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs found to be significant in this region and appears as a distinct novel association.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39868614,Avoiding causal fraud in the evaluation of clinical benefits of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.,"Recent regulatory approvals of three amyloid-lowering monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have triggered a polarizing debate in the field on the clinical meaningfulness of their reported effects. The question of how to define clinical meaningfulness for any treatment that has a modest effect size is important and will likely be subject to influence from interested stakeholders. We warn of claims of evaluating meaningful within-individual change from randomized parallel-group trials of AD treatments, sometimes purportedly assessed by a commonly recognized ""responder"" analysis approach, and explain why it is likely to mislead and should simply be avoided. The average between-group difference in score change is where the debate and research efforts should be focused to contextualize and evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of the true treatment effect. The statistical and communication principles we consider and would recommend are applicable to the evaluation of most interventions in medicine. HIGHLIGHTS: Dichotomized outcome analysis approaches purporting to evaluate within-individual meaningful change are highly likely to mislead. In our view, the most valid statistical approach to understanding the true treatment effect is to analyze the average between-group difference in outcome scores. The average between-group difference in score change is where the debate and research efforts should be focused to contextualize and evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of the true treatment effect.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39794838,Association of antihypertensive drug target genes with alzheimer's disease: a mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and genetic studies have elucidated associations between antihypertensive medication and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the directionality of these associations varying upon the specific class of antihypertensive agents.
METHODS: Genetic instruments for the expression of antihypertensive drug target genes were identified using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in blood, which are associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP). Exposure was derived from existing eQTL data in blood from the eQTLGen consortium and in the brain from the PsychENCODE and subsequently replicated in GTEx V8 and BrainMeta V2. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the potential effect of different antihypertensive drug classes on AD using summary statistics from a meta-analysis (111,326 cases and 677,663 controls) and further replicated in FinnGen cohorts (9301 cases and 367,976 controls). The reverse causality detection, assessing horizontal pleiotropy, Bayesian co-localization, phenotype scanning, and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis were implemented to consolidate the MR findings further.
RESULTS: A 1-standard deviation (SD) lower expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in blood was associated with a lower SBP of 3.92 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.69-5.15) mmHg but an increased risk of AD (odds ratio (OR), 2.46; 95% CI, 1.82-3.33). A similar direction of association was also observed between ACE expression in prefrontal cortex (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.10-1.28), frontal cortex (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27), cerebellum (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.17), cortex (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.28) and ACE protein levels in plasma (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.17) and AD risk. Colocalization supports these results. Similar results were found in external validation. We found no evidence for an association between genetically estimated blood pressure (BP) and AD risk.
CONCLUSIONS: There findings suggest an adverse association of lower ACE messenger RNA and protein levels with an elevated risk of AD, irrespective of its BP-lowering effects. These findings warrant greater pharmacovigilance and further investigation into the effect of ACE inhibitors, particularly those that are centrally acting, on neurodegenerative symptoms in patients with AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39833308,Mapping the cellular etiology of schizophrenia and complex brain phenotypes.,"Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial and effective treatments are lacking. Probable contributing factors to the challenges in therapeutic development include the complexity of the human brain and the high polygenicity of psychiatric disorders. Combining well-powered genome-wide and brain-wide genetics and transcriptomics analyses can deepen our understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we leverage two landmark resources to infer the cell types involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders and informative comparison of brain phenotypes. We found both cortical and subcortical neuronal associations for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. These cell types included somatostatin interneurons, excitatory neurons from the retrosplenial cortex and eccentric medium spiny-like neurons from the amygdala. In contrast we found T cell and B cell associations with multiple sclerosis and microglial associations with Alzheimer's disease. We provide a framework for a cell-type-based classification system that can lead to drug repurposing or development opportunities and personalized treatments. This work formalizes a data-driven, cellular and molecular model of complex brain disorders.",Nat Neurosci,2025
39951190,Genetically Proxied Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) Inhibition and Risk of Dementia: A Drug Target Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors have gained interest as a potential treatment for dementia. However, current evidence is limited to observational and pre-clinical studies. We conducted a drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the on-target effects of pharmacological PDE5 inhibition on dementia subtypes and related phenotypes. We selected variants from around the PDE5A locus associated with diastolic and systolic blood pressure, as well as circulating PDE5A levels, to create three instruments for genetically proxied PDE5A inhibition. Using two-sample MR, we validated the instruments against erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension before assessing their associations with dementia subtypes, dementia-related proteins, and neuroimaging traits. After correcting for multiple comparisons, genetically proxied PDE5 inhibition, per one SD lower in diastolic blood pressure, was associated with higher odds of Alzheimer's disease (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and Lewy body dementia (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23-1.41), but a trend towards lower odds of vascular dementia across all instruments. Genetically proxied PDE5 inhibition was associated with both beneficial and adverse effects on brain MRI traits. This included lower volumes of white matter hyperintensities (SD change - 0.035, 95% CI - 0.025, - 0.045), indicating potential benefits, but also reduced volumes of other structures, including the thalamus, suggesting potential adverse effects. PDE5 inhibition was associated with the concentrations of several proteins implicated in dementia pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that while PDE5 inhibition may be associated with a lower risk of vascular dementia, possibly by preventing white matter hyperintensities, it may increase risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, warranting further investigation before clinical trials.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40098057,Alpha synuclein co-pathology is associated with accelerated amyloid-driven tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Aggregated alpha-Synuclein (αSyn) is a hallmark pathology in Parkinson's disease but also one of the most common co-pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical studies suggest that αSyn can exacerbate tau aggregation, implying that αSyn co-pathology may specifically contribute to the Aβ-induced aggregation of tau that drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. To investigate this, we combined a novel CSF-based seed-amplification assay (SAA) to determine αSyn positivity with amyloid- and tau-PET neuroimaging in a large cohort ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with dementia, examining whether αSyn co-pathology accelerates Aβ-driven tau accumulation and cognitive decline.
METHODS: In 284 Aβ-positive and 308 Aβ-negative subjects, we employed amyloid-PET, Flortaucipir tau-PET, and a CSF-based αSyn seed-amplification assay (SAA) to detect in vivo αSyn aggregation. CSF p-tau<sub>181</sub> measures were available for 384 subjects to assess earliest tau abnormalities. A subset of 155 Aβ-positive and 135 Aβ-negative subjects underwent longitudinal tau-PET over approximately 2.5 years. Using linear regression models, we analyzed whether αSyn SAA positivity was linked to stronger Aβ-related increases in baseline fluid and PET tau biomarkers, faster Aβ-driven tau-PET increase, and more rapid cognitive decline.
RESULTS: αSyn SAA positivity was more common in Aβ + vs. Aβ- subjects and increased with clinical severity (p &lt; 0.001). Most importantly, αSyn positivity was also associated with greater amyloid-associated CSF p-tau<sub>181</sub> increases (p = 0.005) and higher tau-PET levels in AD-typical brain regions (p = 0.006). Longitudinal analyses confirmed further that αSyn positivity was associated with faster amyloid-related tau accumulation (p = 0.029) and accelerated amyloid-related cognitive decline, potentially driven driven by stronger tau pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that αSyn co-pathology, detectable via CSF-based SAAs, is more prevalent in advanced AD and contributes to the development of aggregated tau pathology thereby driving faster cognitive decline. This highlights that a-Syn co-pathology may specifically accelerate amyloid-driven tau pathophysiology in AD, underscoring the need to consider αSyn in AD research and treatment strategies.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39692449,MORE: a multi-omics data-driven hypergraph integration network for biomedical data classification and biomarker identification.,"High-throughput sequencing methods have brought about a huge change in omics-based biomedical study. Integrating various omics data is possibly useful for identifying some correlations across data modalities, thus improving our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and complexity. Nevertheless, most existing graph-based feature extraction methods overlook the complementary information and correlations across modalities. Moreover, these methods tend to treat the features of each omics modality equally, which contradicts current biological principles. To solve these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for integrating multi-omics data termed Multi-Omics hypeRgraph integration nEtwork (MORE). MORE initially constructs a comprehensive hyperedge group by extensively investigating the informative correlations within and across modalities. Subsequently, the multi-omics hypergraph encoding module is employed to learn the enriched omics-specific information. Afterward, the multi-omics self-attention mechanism is then utilized to adaptatively aggregate valuable correlations across modalities for representation learning and making the final prediction. We assess MORE's performance on datasets characterized by message RNA (mRNA) expression, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) methylation, and microRNA (miRNA) expression for Alzheimer's disease, invasive breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma. The results from three classification tasks highlight the competitive advantage of MORE in contrast with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, the results also show that MORE has the capability to identify a greater variety of disease-related biomarkers compared to existing methods, highlighting its advantages in biomedical data mining and interpretation. Overall, MORE can be investigated as a valuable tool for facilitating multi-omics analysis and novel biomarker discovery.

39798829,Pragmatic algorithm for visual assessment of 4-Repeat tauopathies in [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 PET Scans.,"AIM: Standardized evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 tau-PET scans in 4R-tauopathies represents an unmet need in clinical practice. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of visual evaluation of [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 images for diagnosing 4R-tauopathies and to develop a straight-forward reading algorithm to improve objectivity and data reproducibility.
METHODS: A total of 83 individuals with [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 PET scans were included. Participants were classified as probable 4R-tauopathies (n = 29), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 20), α-synucleinopathies (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 19) based on clinical criteria. Visual assessment of tau-PET scans (choice: 4R-tauopathy, AD-tauopathy, no-tauopathy) was conducted using either 20-40-minute or 40-60-minute intervals, with raw (common) and cerebellar grey matter scaled standardized reading settings (intensity-scaled). Two readers evaluated scans independently and blinded, with a third reader providing consensus in case of discrepant primary evaluation. A regional analysis was performed using the cortex, basal ganglia, midbrain, and dentate nucleus. Sensitivity, specificity, and interrater agreement were calculated for all settings and compared against the visual reads of parametric images (0-60-minutes, distribution volume ratios, DVR).
RESULTS: Patients with 4R-tauopathies in contrast to non-4R-tauopathies were detected at higher sensitivity in the 20-40-minute frame (common: 79%, scaled: 76%) compared to the 40-60-minute frame (common: 55%, scaled: 62%), albeit with reduced specificity in the common setting (20-40-min: 78%, 40-60-min: 95%), which was ameliorated in the intensity-scaled setting (20-40-min: 91%, 40-60-min: 96%). Combined assessment of multiple brain regions did not significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity, compared to assessing the basal ganglia alone (76% each). Evaluation of intensity-scaled parametric images resulted in higher sensitivity compared to intensity-scaled static scans (86% vs. 76%) at similar specificity (89% vs. 91%).
CONCLUSION: Visual reading of [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 tau-PET scans demonstrated reliable detection of 4R-tauopathies, particularly when standardized processing methods and early imaging windows were employed. Parametric images should be preferred for visual assessment of 4R-tauopathies.",Neuroimage,2025
39725298,A Multiform Heterogeneity Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Based on Multimodal Neuroimaging.,"Understanding the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for advancing precision medicine specifically tailored to this disorder. Recent research has deepened our understanding of AD heterogeneity; however, translating these insights from bench to bedside via neuroimaging heterogeneity frameworks presents significant challenges. In this review, we systematically revisit prior studies and summarize the existing methodology of data-driven neuroimaging studies for AD heterogeneity. We organized the current methodology into 1) a subtyping clustering strategy for patients with AD, and we also subdivided it into subtyping analysis based on cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging profiles and the identification of long-term disease progression from short-term datasets; 2) a stratified strategy that integrates neuroimaging measures with biomarkers; and 3) individual-specific abnormal patterns based on the normative model. Then, we evaluated the characteristics of these studies along 2 dimensions: 1) the understanding of pathology and 2) clinical application. We systematically address the limitations, challenges, and future directions of research into AD heterogeneity. Our goal is to enhance the neuroimaging heterogeneity framework for AD, thereby facilitating its transition from bench to bedside.",Biol Psychiatry,2024
39927859,Introducing TEC-LncMir for prediction of lncRNA-miRNA interactions through deep learning of RNA sequences.,"The interactions between long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) play critical roles in life processes, highlighting the necessity to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art models. Here, we introduced TEC-LncMir, a novel approach for predicting lncRNA-miRNA interaction using Transformer Encoder and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). TEC-LncMir treats lncRNA and miRNA sequences as natural languages, encodes them using the Transformer Encoder, and combines representations of a pair of microRNA and lncRNA into a contact tensor (a three-dimensional array). Afterward, TEC-LncMir treats the contact tensor as a multi-channel image, utilizes a four-layer CNN to extract the contact tensor's features, and then uses these features to predict the interaction between the pair of lncRNA and miRNA. We applied a series of comparative experiments to demonstrate that TEC-LncMir significantly improves lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction, compared with existing state-of-the-art models. We also trained TEC-LncMir utilizing a large training dataset, and as expected, TEC-LncMir achieves unprecedented performance. Moreover, we integrated miRanda into TEC-LncMir to show the secondary structures of high-confidence interactions. Finally, we utilized TEC-LncMir to identify microRNAs interacting with lncRNA NEAT1, where NEAT1 performs as a competitive endogenous RNA of the microRNAs' targets (mRNAs) in brain cells. We also demonstrated the regulatory mechanism of NEAT1 in Alzheimer's disease via transcriptome analysis and sequence alignment analysis. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectivity of TEC-LncMir, suggest a potential regulation of miRNAs by NEAT1 in Alzheimer's disease, and take a significant step forward in lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction.",Brief Bioinform,2024
40084044,A bibliometric analysis of research hotspots and trends in transcranial magnetic stimulation and Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Research regarding Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasing; however, no bibliometric analysis has yet been conducted in this domain. This study employs bibliometric methods to identify research trends and hotspots concerning AD and TMS.
METHODS: We conducted a search in the Web of Science Core Database for articles related to AD and TMS from January 1, 2014, to October 22, 2024. After stringent selection, we performed bibliometric analysis using Excel, VOSviewer, CiteSpace and CoreMine.
RESULTS: The number of articles pertaining to AD and TMS has increased annually, with a notable surge post-2020. The three leading countries in publication volume are China, the United States, and Italy. The top institutions contributing to this field include Harvard Medical School, the University of Toronto, and the University of Brescia. The author with the highest publication output is Giacomo Koch. The journal with the most publications is the Journal of Alzheimer's disease. The 10 most frequently occurring keywords are Alzheimer's disease, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, memory, double-blind, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, noninvasive brain stimulation, cognitive impairment, and plasticity. Text mining has revealed that the anatomical structure ""brain"" and the gene ""Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)"" are significantly related to both AD and TMS, suggesting that TMS may offer a therapeutic avenue for AD by modulating the activity of APP.
CONCLUSION: Our article employs bibliometric methods to unveil trends in research related to AD and TMS, including collaborations among countries, regions, and authors, as well as key research hotspots. We provide objective data that serves as a reference for scientific research and clinical work concerning AD and TMS.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40133235,Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prevent presymptomatic capillary flow disturbances in a model of cerebral amyloidosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Disturbances in microvascular flow dynamics are hypothesized to precede the symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence in presymptomatic AD remains elusive, underscoring the need for therapies targeting these early vascular changes.
METHODS: We employed a multimodal approach, combining in vivo optical imaging, molecular techniques, and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, to investigate early capillary dysfunction in C57BL/6-Tg(Thy1-APPSwDutIowa)BWevn/Mmjax (Tg-SwDI) mice without memory impairment. We also assessed the efficacy of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in preventing capillary flow disturbances.
RESULTS: Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and amyloid beta (Aβ) load in 9- to 10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice without memory impairment. CAI treatment ameliorated these capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen availability, and reduced Aβ load.
DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow disturbances as early biomarkers in presymptomatic AD and highlight the potential of CAIs for preserving vascular integrity in the early stages of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Uncovered early capillary dysfunction in a presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Evidence linking capillary stalls and capillary dysfunction with oxygen delivery issues in AD. Novel use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to prevent early capillary flow disturbances in AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40043053,Human CD33 deficiency is associated with mild alteration of circulating white blood cell counts.,"The single pass transmembrane protein CD33 is enriched in phagocytic and hematopoietic cell types, such as monocytes. CD33 is thought to be associated with immune cell function, susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease, and rare leukemias. Antagonism or genetic ablation of CD33 has been proposed to treat Alzheimer's disease, hematological cancers, and as a selection mechanism for enriching genetically altered blood cells. To understand the impact of chronic CD33 loss or ablation, we describe individuals who we confirmed to be missing CD33 due to germline loss of function variants. Through PheWAS-based approaches using existing whole exome biobanks and bespoke phenotyping using recall-by-genotype (RBG) studies, we show that CD33 loss of function alters circulating white blood cell counts and distributions, albeit mildly and with no overt clinical pathology. These findings indicate that chronic CD33 antagonism/ablation is likely to be safe in humans.",PLoS Genet,2025
39690174,Brain change trajectories in healthy adults correlate with Alzheimer's related genetic variation and memory decline across life.,"Throughout adulthood and ageing our brains undergo structural loss in an average pattern resembling faster atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a longitudinal adult lifespan sample (aged 30-89; 2-7 timepoints) and four polygenic scores for AD, we show that change in AD-sensitive brain features correlates with genetic AD-risk and memory decline in healthy adults. We first show genetic risk links with more brain loss than expected for age in early Braak regions, and find this extends beyond APOE genotype. Next, we run machine learning on AD-control data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using brain change trajectories conditioned on age, to identify AD-sensitive features and model their change in healthy adults. Genetic AD-risk linked with multivariate change across many AD-sensitive features, and we show most individuals over age ~50 are on an accelerated trajectory of brain loss in AD-sensitive regions. Finally, high genetic risk adults with elevated brain change showed more memory decline through adulthood, compared to high genetic risk adults with less brain change. Our findings suggest quantitative AD risk factors are detectable in healthy individuals, via a shared pattern of ageing- and AD-related neurodegeneration that occurs along a continuum and tracks memory decline through adulthood.",Nat Commun,2024
39801712,Locus coeruleus signal intensity and emotion regulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation is seen in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus from the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease onwards and has been associated with symptoms of agitation. It is hypothesized that compensatory locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system overactivity and impaired emotion regulation could underlie agitation propensity, but to our knowledge this has not previously been investigated. A better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of agitation would help the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Using a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and probable mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE) study cohort (N = 309, aged 67-96 years, 51% female), we assessed cross-sectional relationships between a latent factor representing the functional integrity of an affect-related executive regulation network and agitation point prevalence and severity scores. In a subsample of individuals with locus coeruleus MRI imaging data (N = 37, aged 68-93 years, 49% female), we also investigated preliminary associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios (a measure of structural integrity, whole or divided into rostral, middle, and caudal thirds) and individual affect-related regulation network factor scores and agitation measures. Regression models controlled for effects of age and clinical disease severity and, for models including resting-state functional MRI connectivity variables, grey matter volume and education years. Agitation point prevalence showed a positive relationship with a latent factor representing the functional integrity (and a negative relationship with a corresponding structural measure) of the affect-related executive regulation network. Locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios were positively associated with agitation severity (but only for the rostral third, in N = 13) and negatively associated with the functional affect-related executive regulation latent factor scores. Resting-state functional connectivity between a medial prefrontal cortex region and the left amygdala was related to locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios. These findings implicate the involvement of locus coeruleus integrity and emotion dysregulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease and support the presence of potential compensatory processes. At the neural level, there may be a dissociation between mechanisms underlying agitation risk per se and symptom severity. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings, incorporating longitudinal designs, measures of autonomic function and non-linear modelling approaches to explore potential causal and context-dependent relationships across Alzheimer's disease stages.",Brain Commun,2025
39939821,"Soluble cerebral Aβ protofibrils link Aβ plaque pathology to changes in CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratios, neurofilament light and tau in Alzheimer's disease model mice.","The Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the concentrations of neurofilament light (NfL) and total tau (t-tau) are changed in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)<sup>1</sup>, but their neurobiological correlates are not entirely understood. Here, we used 5xFAD transgenic mice to investigate the associations between these CSF biomarkers and measures of cerebral Aβ, including Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratios in plaques, insoluble fibrillar deposits and soluble protofibrils. A high Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio in soluble protofibrils was the strongest independent predictor of low CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratios and high CSF NfL and t-tau concentrations when compared to Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratios in plaques and insoluble fibrillar deposits. Furthermore, the Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio in soluble protofibrils fully mediated the associations between the corresponding ratio in plaques and all the investigated CSF biomarkers. In App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> knock-in mice, protofibrils fully mediated the association between plaques and the CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio. Together, the results suggest that the Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio in CSF might better reflect brain levels of soluble Aβ protofibrils than insoluble Aβ fibrils in plaques in AD. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of NfL and t-tau in CSF might be triggered by increased brain levels of soluble Aβ protofibrils.",Nat Aging,2025
39967802,Alzheimer's disease and gut-brain axis: Drosophila melanogaster as a model.,"Research indicates that by 2050, more than 150 million people will be living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition associated with neurodegeneration due to the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau proteins. In addition to genetic background, endocrine disruption, and cellular senescence, management of the gut microbiota has emerged as a key element in the diagnosis, progression, and treatment of AD, as certain bacterial metabolites can travel through the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier. This mini-review explores the relationship between tau protein accumulation and gut dysbiosis in Drosophila melanogaster. This model facilitates the investigation of how gut-derived metabolites contribute to neurocognitive impairment and dementia. Understanding the role of direct and indirect bacterial by-products, such as lactate and acetate, in glial cell activation and tau protein dynamics may provide insights into the mechanisms of AD progression and contribute to more effective treatments. Here we discuss how the simplicity and extensive genetic tools of Drosophila make it a valuable model for studying these interactions and testing potential therapeutics, including probiotics. Integrating Drosophila studies with other established models may reveal conserved pathways and accelerate the translation of findings into clinical applications.",Front Neurosci,2025
39880935,APOE4 and sedentary lifestyle synergistically impair neurovascular function in the visual cortex of awake mice.,"Reduced cerebral blood flow occurs early in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the factors producing this reduction are unknown. Here, we ask whether genetic and lifestyle risk factors for AD-the ε4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APOE) gene, and physical activity-can together produce this reduction in cerebral blood flow which leads eventually to AD. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy and haemodynamic measures, we record neurovascular function from the visual cortex of physically active or sedentary mice expressing APOE3 and APOE4 in place of murine APOE. Energy supply and demand are mismatched in APOE4 mice, with smaller increases in cerebral blood flow, blood volume and blood oxygenation occurring during neuronal activation as blood vessels frequently fail to dilate. Exercise dose-dependently overall improves neurovascular function, with an increased impact of exercise apparent after longer exposure times. Several haemodynamic measures show a larger beneficial effect of exercise in APOE4 vs. APOE3 mice. Thus, APOE4 genotype in conjunction with sedentary behaviour produces the worst neurovascular function. Promotion of physical activity may therefore be particularly important to improve cerebrovascular function and reduce dementia risk in APOE4 carriers.",Commun Biol,2025
39825066,Association between herpes simplex virus infection and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: analysis within the MAPT trial.,"In vitro and animal studies have suggested that inoculation with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can lead to amyloid deposits, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and/or neuronal loss. Here, we studied the association between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in humans. Our sample included 182 participants at risk of cognitive decline from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial who had HSV-1 plasma serology and an amyloid PET scan. Plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain and p-tau181 were also available for a sub-sample of participants. Multivariate linear regressions were performed and stratified by APOE4 genotype. The median age was 74.0 years, 85.2% were infected with HSV-1. Infected participants tended to have a lower cortical amyloid load than uninfected participants (β = -0.08, p = 0.06), especially those suspected of reactivating HSV-1 most frequently (i.e. with a high anti-HSV-1 IgG level; n = 58, β = -0.09 p = 0.04). After stratification, the association was only significant in APOE4 carriers (n = 43, β = -0.21 p = 0.01). No association was found with the plasma biomarkers. The trend toward lower cortical amyloid load in HSV-1-infected participants was unexpected given the pre-existing literature and may be explained either by a modified immune response in HSV-1 infected subjects which could favour the clearance of amyloid deposits or by a selection bias.",Sci Rep,2025
39991798,Functional insight into East Asian-specific genetic risk loci for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The functional study of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides insights into the underlying mechanisms and identification of potential therapeutic targets. Investigating AD-associated genetic loci identified in East Asian populations using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data may identify novel functional genetic contributors.
METHODS: Cell type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and peak-to-gene links were used to identify functional genes associated with 26 genetic loci from seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AD in East Asians.
RESULTS: KCNJ6 and MAPK1IP1L were identified as significant eQTLs with AD risk loci. AD risk loci were in peaks related to four genes, with CLIC4 being connected across different cell types. Genes identified in European and East Asian GWAS interacted within networks and were enriched in AD pathology pathways in astrocytes.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest KCNJ6 and CLIC4 as novel AD-associated functional genes, providing insight into the genetic architecture of AD in East Asians.
HIGHLIGHTS: Integrated functional analysis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) loci in seven East Asian genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was performed. Cell type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin peaks were used to identify AD functional genes. An AD risk variant was linked to KCNJ6 through an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell-specific eQTL. An AD risk variant maps to open chromatin, linked to CLIC4 across six cell types. Astrocyte differentially expressed genes by AD pathology are enriched in East Asian and European GWAS genes.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39753747,A subcellular sampling instrument allows spatial resolution of amyloid deposit-derived organelle-specific effects in microglia.,"Methodological developments in biomedical research are currently moving towards single-cell approaches. This allows for a much better spatial and functional characterization of, for example, the deterioration of cells within a tissue in response to noxae. However, subcellular resolution is also essential to elucidate whether observed impairments are driven by an explicit organelle. Here, we use the Single Cellome™ System SS2000 (Yokogawa) to investigate the local effects of Aβ plaque-like deposits (characteristic for Alzheimer's disease) on mitochondria in the mouse microglial cell line SIM-A9. First, the specificity of subcellular extraction is demonstrated by detecting subcellular staining and RT-qPCR concerning marker genes by comparing nuclear and mitochondrial samples. Oxygen consumption and gene expression is then assessed in cells near and far from peptide deposits. Mostly, all analyses confirm the high specificity and integrity of the sampled material. In addition, impact of the peptide deposits occur concerning spatial distribution of the cells: e.g., oxygen consumption is only reduced in cells close to Aβ deposits but not in proximity to deposits of biologically inactive Aβ (scrambled) or in far distance. Moreover, a distance-related gene expression pattern occurs, demonstrating the local initiation of mitochondrial changes of microglia when approaching toxic peptide deposits.",Commun Biol,2025
39875780,Research Progress in the Molecular Mechanism of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Alzheimer's Disease and Regulation by Natural Plant Products.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system in the elderly. Current understanding of AD primarily centers on the gradual decline in cognitive and memory functions, believed to be influenced by factors including mitochondrial dysfunction, β-amyloid aggregation, and neuroinflammation. Emerging research indicates that neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the development of AD, with the inflammasome potentially mediating inflammatory responses that contribute to neurodegeneration. Recent studies in AD pathology have identified a novel form of inflammasome referred to as NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Pathological alterations closely associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation have been observed in the brain tissues of AD patients, transgenic mice, and in vitro neurocyte models. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potent neuroprotective properties of natural plant products (NPPs) against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated AD pathology. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the NLRP3 inflammasome, its involvement in AD pathology, and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of NPP targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40100917,Parthenolide regulates microglial and astrocyte function in primary cultures from ALS mice and has neuroprotective effects on primary motor neurons.,"Over the last twenty years, the role of microgliosis and astrocytosis in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases has increasingly been recognized. Dysregulation of microglial and astrocyte properties and function has been described also in the fatal degenerative motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Microglia cells, the immune cells of the nervous system, can either have an immunonegative neurotoxic or immunopositive neuroprotective phenotype. The feverfew plant (Tanacetum parthenium) derived compound parthenolide has been found to be capable of interfering with microglial phenotype and properties. Positive treatment effects were shown in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Now we were able to show that PTL has a modulating effect on primary mouse microglia cells, both wild type and SOD1, causing them to adopt a more neuroprotective potential. Furthermore, we were able to show that PTL, through its positive effect on microglia, also has an indirect positive impact on motor neurons, although PTL itself has no direct effect on these primary motor neurons. The results of our study give reason to consider PTL as a drug candidate for ALS.",PLoS One,2025
39886321,Inflammation biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease: A pilot study using NULISAseq.,"INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence links amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation with inflammation. This pilot study investigated the use of an immunoassay panel to map biomarker changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we evaluated the stability of protein quantification after multiple freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs).
METHODS: The nucleic acid-linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) inflammation panel measured 203 proteins in serum samples of individuals with (n = 31) and without (n = 31) AD pathology. Linear models, adjusted for age and sex, contrasted protein expression across groups.
RESULTS: After multiple-testing adjustments, glial fibrillary acidic protein (p &lt; 0.001) and S100A12 (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly changed in the presence of AD pathology. Furthermore, they correlated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (phosphorylated tau-181 [p-tau181], tau, and Aβ42). Additional markers were nominally changed between groups. Five FTCs caused minimal changes in measurements with the NULISA inflammation panel.
DISCUSSION: Monitoring of inflammation in AD, using the 200-plex NULISA panel, demonstrates changes in peripherally circulating inflammation-related proteins. Contrary to previous reports, FTCs had minimal impact on the quantification of inflammatory markers.

Terbutaline is an agonist of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors which is formed by decarbamoylation of bambuterol by butyrylcholinesterase. Inhibition of the latter, as well as activation of β<sub>2</sub>-AR, are of interest for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Combining these two activities, bambuterol could express a good clinical efficacy against AD. The present work firstly confirmed the capacity of bambuterol to display in cellulo neuroprotective activities, reduction of Tau hyperphosphorylation and preservation of synapses in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures intoxicated with Aβ peptides. Further, bambuterol, in the form of a liposomal gel, showed a good bioavailability in CNS after intranasal administration, which should reduce any side effects linked to peripheral terbutaline release. Indeed, even if the latter is more selective than other β<sub>2</sub>-mimetics towards bronchial β<sub>2</sub>-AR, cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, arrhythmias…) could occur upon cardiac β<sub>1</sub>-AR activation. Finally, intranasal administration of low doses of bambuterol gel in mice intoxicated with Aβ peptides, prevented long-term spatial memory impairment and showed beneficial effects on the survival of neurons and on synapse preservation.",Commun Biol,2025
39902280,Octodon degus laboratory colony management principles and methods for behavioral analysis for Alzheimer's disease neuroscience research.,"The Chilean degu (Octodon degus) is a medium sized, long-lived rodent with traits that make them a natural model for neuroscience research. Their social behaviors, diurnality, and extended developmental time course, when compared to other rodents, make them useful for social behavioral, chronobiology, and developmental research. Lab-kept degus have a long lifespan (5-8 years) and may naturally develop age-related diseases that resemble Alzheimer's disease. While there is significant interest in using the Octodon degus for neuroscience research, including aging and Alzheimer's disease studies, laboratory management and methods for degus research are currently not standardized. This lack of standardization potentially impacts study reproducibility and makes it difficult to compare results between different laboratories. Degus require species-specific housing and handling methods that reflect their ecology, life history, and group-living characteristics. Here we introduce major principles and ethological considerations of colony management and husbandry. We provide clear instructions on laboratory practices necessary for maintaining a healthy and robust colony of degus for Alzheimer's disease neuroscience research towards conducting reproducible studies. We also report detailed procedures and methodical information for degu Apoe genotyping and ethologically relevant burrowing behavioral tasks in laboratory settings.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40139278,Influence of WWOX/MAF genes on cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Beyond its hallmark motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) encompasses a range of non-motor disturbances, particularly cognitive impairment, which significantly affects patients' quality of life. Cognitive impairment is a shared manifest in both PD and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Existing literature has identified the WWOX/MAF genes as potential risk factors for AD, but their role in cognitive functions among PD remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study examines the influence of AD-associated risk genes, specifically WWOX/MAF, on cognitive function in PD, aiming to bridge the neuropathological gap between AD and PD.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 402 participants were included in this study, comprising 150 individuals with PD and 252 healthy controls (HC).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and genotyping. A moderation regression model was employed to assess the impact of WWOX/MAF single nucleotide polymorphisms on cognitive function and the potential modulatory effect of PD.
RESULTS: The WWOX gene was found to influence verbal fluency performance across the entire cohort. Additionally, PD significantly moderated the effect of genetic variants on attention (p = 0.000040), non-verbal memory (p = 0.000007), and visuospatial function (p = 0.000303), suggesting a distinct impact within this group. Further analysis indicated that cognitive status moderated the effect of genetic variants on verbal memory across the entire cohort (p < 0.001). Among individuals with PD, genetic variants also influenced verbal fluency (p = 0.000113) and verbal memory (p = 0.000440 and p = 0.000032).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the critical role of WWOX/MAF genes in cognitive impairments associated with PD, enhancing our understanding of their connection to AD and providing deeper insights into neurodegenerative disease progression.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
40127100,Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 mediates presynaptic dysfunction induced by amyloid β oligomers.,"Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is initiated by oligomers of amyloid β peptide (Aβ<sub>o</sub>s). Treatments aimed at correcting synaptic dysfunction could be beneficial in preventing disease progression, but mechanisms underlying Aβ<sub>o</sub>-induced synaptic defects remain incompletely understood. Here, we uncover an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) - Ca<sub>V</sub>2.3 - protein kinase C (PKC) - glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signal transduction pathway that is engaged by Aβ<sub>o</sub>s to enhance presynaptic Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity, resulting in pathological potentiation of action-potential-evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We present evidence that the pathway is active in human APP transgenic mice in vivo and in human AD brains, and we show that either pharmacological Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 inhibition or genetic Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to restore normal neurotransmitter release. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism driving synaptic dysfunction in AD and identify multiple potentially tractable therapeutic targets.",Cell Rep,2025
39878233,Sleep spindles and slow oscillations predict cognition and biomarkers of neurodegeneration in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Changes in sleep physiology can predate cognitive symptoms by decades in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it remains unclear which sleep characteristics predict cognitive and neurodegenerative changes after AD onset.
METHODS: Using data from a prospective cohort of mild to moderate AD (n = 60), we analyzed non-rapid eye movement sleep spindles and slow oscillations (SOs) at baseline and their associations with baseline amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau and with cognition from baseline to 3-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Higher spindle and SO activity predicted significant changes in Aβ and tau at baseline, lower Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (better cognitive performance) score, and higher Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to 36 months. Spindles and SOs mediated the effect of phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181)/Aβ42 on cognition, while pTau181/aβ42 moderated the effect of spindles and SOs on cognition.
DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that spindle and SO activity during sleep constitute predictive and non-invasive biomarkers of neurodegeneration and cognition in AD patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Sleep spindles predict long-term cognitive performance in AD. Sleep spindle and SOs can be predictive, non-invasive biomarkers for AD. Sleep may be one of the most important modifiable risk factors for AD progression. Sleep microarchitecture is a novel therapeutic target for preserving brain heath. Sleep physiology can provide novel therapeutic targets to slow AD progression.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

39779882,Consuming a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet reverses the peripheral lipid signature of Alzheimer's disease in humans.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder with significant environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, influencing its onset and progression. Although previous studies have suggested that certain diets may reduce the incidence of AD, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
METHOD: In this post-hoc analysis of a randomized crossover study of 20 elderly adults, we investigated the effects of a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) on the plasma lipidome in the context of AD biomarkers, analyzing 784 lipid species across 47 classes using a targeted lipidomics platform.
RESULTS: Here we identified substantial changes in response to MMKD intervention, aside from metabolic changes associated with a ketogenic diet, we identified a a global elevation across all plasmanyl and plasmenyl ether lipid species, with many changes linked to clinical and biochemical markers of AD. We further validated our findings by leveraging our prior clinical studies into lipid related changeswith AD (n = 1912), and found that the lipidomic signature with MMKD was inversely associated with the lipidomic signature of prevalent and incident AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Intervention with a MMKD was able to alter the plasma lipidome in ways that contrast with AD-associated patterns. Given its low risk and cost, MMKD could be a promising approach for prevention or early symptomatic treatment of AD.",Commun Med (Lond),2025
39690817,Integrated multi-omics analysis revealed the molecular networks and potential targets of cellular senescence in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cellular senescence (CS) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms through which CS contributes to AD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. We found that CS level in AD was higher compared with the healthy control group. Transcriptome-based differential expression analysis identified 113 CS-related genes in blood and 410 in brain tissue as potential candidate genes involved in AD. To further explore the causal role of these genes, an integrative mendelian randomization analysis was conducted, combining AD genome-wide association study summary statistics with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data from blood samples, which identified five putative AD-causal genes (CENPW, EXOSC9, HSPB11, SLC44A2, and SLFN12) and 18 corresponding DNA methylation probes. Additionally, integrative analysis between eQTLs and mQTLs from blood uncovered two genes and 12 corresponding regulatory elements involved in AD. Furthermore, two genes (CDKN2B and ITGAV) were prioritized as putative causal genes in brain tissue and were validated through in vitro experiments. The multi-omics integration study revealed the potential role and underlying biological mechanisms of CS driven by genetic predisposition in AD. This study contributed to fundamental understanding of CS in AD pathogenesis and facilitated the identification of potential therapeutic targets for AD prevention and treatment.",Hum Mol Genet,2025
39868506,An unsupervised learning approach for clustering joint trajectories of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: An application to ADNI Data.,"INTRODUCTION: Current models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression assume a common pattern and pathology, oversimplifying the heterogeneity of clinical AD.
METHODS: We define a syndrome as a unique biomarker progression pattern and develop a lag measure to cluster pre-dementia individuals, reflecting their pathology's multi-dimensionality. The technique uses the time-ordering of events to group individuals based on their position along the disease process and the relative positions of their markers.
RESULTS: An application using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data highlights the need for our novel approach to clustering individuals into syndrome groups.
DISCUSSION: Accurately characterizing biomarker curves associated with brain damage requires an initial step that groups individuals on a syndrome basis, accounting for the heterogeneity of underlying pathologies in clinical AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Developed a novel distance measure and clustering approach for AD biomarker trajectories. Identified distinct subgroups with different biomarker progression patterns in ADNI data. Findings challenge the traditional amyloid cascade hypothesis and suggest AD heterogeneity. Clustering approach accounts for shifts in time and emphasizes progression patterns. Results have implications for AD diagnosis, targeted interventions, and clinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39707506,Paradoxical attenuation of early amyloid-induced cognitive impairment and synaptic plasticity in an aged APP/Tau bigenic rat model.,"The combination of amyloid beta and tau pathologies leads to tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relative contributions of amyloid beta and tau peptide accumulation to the manifestation of the pathological phenotype in the early stages, before the overt deposition of plaques and tangles, are still unclear. We investigated the longitudinal pathological effects of combining human-like amyloidosis and tauopathy in a novel transgenic rat model, coded McGill-R-APPxhTau. We compared the effects of individual and combined amyloidosis and tauopathy in transgenic rats by assessing the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's-like amyloid and tau pathologies using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Extensive behavioral testing for learning and memory was also conducted to evaluate cognitive decline. Additionally, we investigated brain inflammation, neuronal cell loss, as well as synaptic plasticity through acute brain slice electrophysiological recordings and Western blotting. Evaluation of Alzheimer's-like amyloidosis and tauopathy, at the initial stages, unexpectedly revealed that the combination of amyloid pathology with the initial increment in phosphorylated tau exerted a paradoxical corrective effect on amyloid-induced cognitive impairments and led to a compensatory-like restoration of synaptic plasticity as revealed by electrophysiological evidence, compared to monogenic transgenic rats with amyloidosis or tauopathy. We discovered elevated CREB phosphorylation and increased expression of postsynaptic proteins as a tentative explanation for the improved hippocampal synaptic plasticity. However, this tau-induced protective effect on synaptic function was transient. As anticipated, at more advanced stages, the APPxhTau bigenic rats exhibited aggravated tau and amyloid pathologies, cognitive decline, increased neuroinflammation, and tau-driven neuronal loss compared to monogenic rat models of Alzheimer's-like amyloid and tau pathologies. The present findings propose that the early accumulation of phosphorylated tau may have a transient protective impact on the evolving amyloid pathology-derived synaptic impairments.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2024
40176187,Integrative network analysis reveals novel moderators of Aβ-Tau interaction in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Although interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the Aβ-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD.
METHODS: Proteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05).
RESULTS: Our results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and GPNMB gene expression positively contributed to the interaction of tau with Aβ in non-dementia cases, replicating the results of the network analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction in early AD and therefore are a novel therapeutic target. To facilitate further research, we have made the integrated network available as a visualization tool for the scientific community (URL: https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/AlzPPMap ).",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39981405,A bibliometric analysis of research on dementia comorbid with depression from 2005 to 2024.,"INTRODUCTION: With the global rise in life expectancy, the incidence of dementia is increasing, often accompanied by depressive symptoms. Understanding the interplay between dementia and depression is crucial, as depression may not only co-occur with but also potentially exacerbate the progression of dementia. This study employs bibliometric analysis to map the global research landscape, identify prevailing themes, and discern future research directions.
METHODS: We analyzed reviews and original research articles on dementia and depression extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2005 to 2024. Utilizing tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and an R-based bibliometric analysis package, we assessed trends in publication volume, citation frequency, contributing countries, leading institutions, predominant journals, influential authors, and emergent keywords.
RESULTS: A total of 1972 publications were obtained, revealing a consistent increase in both the number of publications and their citation impact over the study period. The United States is the country with the most publications and the most extensive collaborations. The University of Toronto and the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease were identified as key contributors to this field. This research area is currently focused on cognitive impairments, the role of gut microbiota, and non-drug interventions. Future directions emphasize the importance of early detection and intervention, a deeper understanding of the gut-brain axis, and the integration of technology in treatment strategies. Additionally, there is a growing interest in the physiological and psychological interplays such as oxidative stress and its implications.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores pathogenesis, comorbid conditions, and non-drug interventions as primary research focal points, suggesting these areas as potential pathways for therapeutic innovation. These insights are intended to deepen our understanding, enhance diagnostics, and improve the management of dementia and depression, providing guidance for future research aimed at addressing these escalating global health challenges.",Front Neurosci,2025

METHODS: We stratified 570 non-demented Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants by Aβ PET and further by CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> or p-tau181/Aβ<sub>42</sub>. We used analysis of covariance testing adjusting for covariates, followed by Tukey post hoc pairwise comparisons, to compare CSF soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (sTREM2) across four participant groups: CSF+ <sub>Aβ42</sub> with CSF- <sub>p-tau/Aβ42</sub>, CSF- <sub>Aβ42</sub> with CSF+ <sub>p-tau/Aβ42</sub>, and concordant CSF<sub>Aβ42</sub>/CSF<sub>p-tau/Aβ42</sub>. We also compared sTREM2 across discordant and concordant CSF<sub>Aβ42</sub>/PET.
RESULTS: Regardless of Aβ PET status, CSF+<sub>Aβ42</sub> with CSF-<sub>p-tau/Aβ42</sub> had lower sTREM2 than CSF-<sub>Aβ42</sub> with CSF+<sub>p-tau/Aβ42</sub>. CSF sTREM2 was similarly also associated with discordant CSF Aβ42 /PET.
DISCUSSION: Our study suggests the potential roles of sTREM2 in discordant CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> and p-tau181/Aβ<sub>42</sub> and discordant CSF<sub>Aβ42</sub>/PET. Low- and high-CSF sTREM2 may affect the accuracy of p-tau181/Aβ<sub>42</sub> during the clinical work-up of AD.

39891909,A central role for acetylcholine in entorhinal cortex function and dysfunction with age in humans and mice.,"Structural and functional changes in the entorhinal cortex (EC) are among the earliest signs of cognitive aging. Here, we ask whether a compromised cholinergic system influences early EC impairments and plays a primary role in EC cognition. We evaluated the relationship between loss of integrity of cholinergic inputs to the EC and cognitive deficits in otherwise healthy humans and mice. Using in vivo imaging (PET/MRI) in older humans and high-resolution imaging in wild-type mice and mice with genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease pathology, we establish that loss of cholinergic input to the EC is, in fact, an early feature in cognitive aging. Through mechanistic studies in mice, we find a central role for EC-projecting cholinergic neurons in the expression of EC-related behaviors. Our data demonstrate that alterations to the cholinergic EC are an early, conserved feature of cognitive aging across species and may serve as an early predictor of cognitive status.",Cell Rep,2025
39791373,Insulin signaling and oxidative stress: Bridging the gap between type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two prevalent chronic diseases that pose significant global health challenges. Increasing evidence suggests a complex bidirectional relationship between these conditions, where T2D elevates the risk of AD, and AD exacerbates glucose metabolism abnormalities in T2D.
OBJECTIVE: This review explores the molecular mechanisms linking T2D and AD, focusing on the role of insulin signaling pathways and oxidative stress.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search from PubMed, Web of Science, and other relevant databases was conducted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Insulin resistance in T2D leads to impaired insulin signaling in the brain, contributing to cognitive decline and the development of AD. Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress exacerbates neuronal damage, promoting the formation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of AD. Clinically antidiabetic drugs such as metformin show potential against AD in preclinical studies; Many natural products such as Dendrobium nobile Lindl. have anti-T2D efficacy and are also effective against AD in various in vivo and in vitro models.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving insulin resistance and reducing oxidative stress are important strategies in the treatment of T2D and AD. To understand the bridging role of insulin singling and oxidative stress in T2D and AD will provide insights and broader applications in alleviating T2D and AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40069789,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment of oral nicotinamide in the NEAT clinical trial for early Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide, a form of B3 vitamin, is an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor that reduces pTau<sub>231</sub> levels via histone deacetylase inhibition in murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent phase 2a randomized placebo-controlled trial tested high-dose oral nicotinamide for the treatment of early AD. While nicotinamide demonstrated good safety and tolerability, it did not significantly lower CSF pTau<sub>231</sub>, the primary biomarker endpoint of the study. Characterization of nicotinamide's pharmacokinetics and metabolites in the blood and CSF is needed.
METHODS: In these post hoc, blinded analyses of plasma and CSF samples from the completed two-site placebo controlled randomized trial testing of 1500 mg PO BID oral nicotinamide, we used mass spectroscopy to measure nicotinamide and its inactive metabolite 1-methyl-nicotinamide in plasma at baseline, 6, and 12 months and in CSF at baseline and 12 months from 23 participants on drug and 24 on placebo.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis found mean 12 month plasma nicotinamide increased &gt; 130-fold to 52 μM while mean methyl-nicotinamide increased &gt; 600-fold to 91 μM in individuals receiving nicotinamide compared to those receiving placebo, whose levels were unchanged from baseline. However, CSF nicotinamide was only measurable in 6 of the 19 available participants (32%) (mean increase of at least 147-fold to 18 μM). These CSF nicotinamide concentrations were 66% of their plasma levels, indicating good CNS bioavailability in only some participants. In contrast to CSF nicotinamide, more treated participants had higher CSF methyl-nicotinamide (n = 9, 43 μM), suggesting high-dosage nicotinamide was sufficient to pass the blood-brain barrier, but 13 of 19 were metabolically inactivated. Treatment favorably decreased mean pTau<sub>231</sub> levels by 34% in those six participants with elevated CSF levels of nicotinamide, compared to 3% elevation in participants who did not have elevated CSF nicotinamide, and a 3% decrease for placebo. No such relationships were observed for total tau, pTau<sub>181</sub>, or amyloid beta biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that oral administration markedly increased mean plasma nicotinamide levels, however CSF levels were below quantitation in a majority of participants and there was extensive metabolic inactivation to methyl-nicotinamide. Both the bioavailability and rapid metabolic methylation need to be addressed if nicotinamide is further developed as a potential intervention for AD.

39762217,Associations of plasma biomarkers with cerebral perfusion and structure in Alzheimer's disease.,"Plasma biomarkers have great potential in the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, findings on their associations with cerebral perfusion and structural changes are inconclusive. We examined both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between plasma biomarkers and cerebral blood flow (CBF), gray matter (GM) volume, and white matter (WM) integrity. Forty-eight AD patients whose diagnosis was supported by amyloid-β (Aβ) PET received measurement of plasma biomarkers with a single molecular array, including Aβ42, phosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), total tau (T-tau), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and both baseline and one-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, including pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, T1-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. Correlations were found between regional CBF and several plasma biomarkers, with Aβ42 showing the strongest correlation with CBF in the left inferior temporal gyrus (r = 0.507, p = 0.001). Plasma P-tau181 and GFAP levels were correlated with GM volume in the posterior cingulate gyrus and the bilateral hippocampus and right middle temporal gyrus, respectively. Decreased CBF and GM volume in regions vulnerable to AD, such as the posterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and hippocampus, could be predicted by the levels of specific plasma biomarkers. Most biomarkers, except Aβ42, showed extensive correlations with longitudinal WM disruption. Plasma biomarkers exhibited varied correlations with brain perfusion, GM volume, and WM integrity and predicted their longitudinal changes in AD patients, suggesting their potential to reflect functional and structural changes and to monitor pathophysiological progression in the brain.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
40185252,"Effects of Bufexamac, a class IIb HDAC inhibitor, on behavior and neuropathological features in an Aβ-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease.","It has been suggested that Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurological condition, can potentially be treated through epigenetic means by targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes that regulate gene expression. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of Bufexamac, in an animal model of AD. Bufexamac specifically targets Class IIb HDACs, which are particularly relevant in the context of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This selectivity may reduce off-target effects commonly associated with broader-spectrum HDAC inhibitors, such as pan-HDAC inhibitors, which can affect multiple HDAC classes and potentially lead to undesirable side effects. Male rats injected with Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> for AD-like symptoms were treated with 20 μg/rat Bufexamac for 8 days. Cognitive function, depression, and anxiety were assessed through behavioral tests, while Western blotting, H&amp;E staining, and ELISA were used to detect protein expression, morphological changes, and enzyme activity. Bufexamac treatment markedly improved cognitive and behavioral impairments in Aβ-injected rats and regulated the key proteins related to neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1), histone, and α-tubulin acetylation. Simultaneously, it decreased the expression of proteins in the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) pathway. Furthermore, Bufexamac lowered the activity of monoamine oxidase enzymes, elevated the count of healthy neurons, and ameliorated neuronal structure in the hippocampus. Overall, these findings suggest that Bufexamac could be a more targeted therapy for AD than other non-selective HDAC inhibitors, which often have diverse functions and potential side effects. Bufexamac enhances cognitive function and alleviates depression and anxiety by regulating proteins related to neuroinflammation, histone, and α-tubulin acetylation, as well as modulating STIM levels and MAO activity.",Exp Gerontol,2025
39697482,Differences in cerebral structure among patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Brain has been shown to undergo progressive atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, more evidence is needed to elucidate how the brain structure changes during the progression to AD. Here, we observed differences in the cerebral structure among patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with AD.
METHODS: A total of 46 participants were selected and divided into AD, aMCI, and healthy control (HC) groups. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) was performed on all participants. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) techniques were utilized to analyze sMRI data so as to identify significant differences among the specific brain regions of these three groups. Then, a correlation analysis was performed on the characteristics of the identified brain regions and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cognitive assessment scores.
RESULTS: The volume of the left precuneus region, which was identified by voxel-based morphometry, and the thickness of both sides of the inferior parietal, which was identified by surface-based morphometry, were shown to be less in AD/aMCI patients, compared to those of the HC. The correlation analysis showed that there were significant differences between the volume of the left precuneus region and the MMSE/MoCA scores, as well as between the thickness of the left and right sides of the inferior parietal region and the MMSE/MoCA scores.
CONCLUSION: The sMRI characteristics of the identified brain regions were considered to be potential predictive diagnostic biomarkers for AD.

39874294,Suppressing APOE4-induced neural pathologies by targeting the VHL-HIF axis.,"The ε4 variant of human apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is a key genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and elevated all-cause mortality in humans. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that can mitigate the harmful effects of APOE4 has significant implications. In this study, we find that inactivating the VHL-1 (Von Hippel-Lindau) protein can suppress mortality, neural and behavioral pathologies caused by transgenic human APOE4 in Caenorhabditis elegans. The protective effects of VHL-1 deletion are recapitulated by stabilized HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor), a transcription factor degraded by VHL-1. HIF-1 activates a genetic program that safeguards against mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteostasis imbalance, and endolysosomal rupture-critical cellular events linked to neural pathologies and mortality. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Vhl reduces cerebral vascular injury and synaptic lesions in APOE4 mice, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Thus, we identify the VHL-HIF axis as a potent modulator of APOE4-induced neural pathologies and propose that targeting this pathway in nonproliferative tissues may curb cellular damage, protect against neurodegeneration, and reduce tissue injuries and mortality.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025

Here, we perform a GWAS on cerebral β-amyloid deposition measured by PET imaging in 3,885 East Asians and a cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis with data from 11,816 European participants. Our GWAS analysis replicates known loci (APOE4, CR1, and FERMT2) and identifies a novel locus near SORL1 that is significantly associated with β-amyloid deposition. Single-nucleus expression analysis shows that SORL1 is differentially expressed according to β-amyloid positivity in microglia. Our joint association analysis using the SORL1 lead variant (rs76490923) and the APOE4 allele demonstrates that the risk of β-amyloid deposition is reduced by up to 43.5% in APOE4 non-carriers and up to 55.6% in APOE4 carriers, according to the allelic dosage of the rs76490923 T allele.

Apart from the buildup of amyloid-β plaques inside the brain tissue, it has been demonstrated that abnormal tau protein phosphorylation increases the risk of neuronal death. The discovery of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is becoming increasingly significant in the fight to create efficacious Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies. The pathophysiology of AD, which includes the creation of amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation, is intimately connected with the dysregulation of DYRK1A, which is essential for neurodevelopment and cognitive function. In addition to amyloid plaques, DYRK1A phosphorylates tau on 11 distinct Ser/Thr residues, forming aggregates known as ""neurofibrillary tangles"" that may be the cause of dementia, neuronal degeneration, and cell death. Therefore, targeting DYRK1A with small molecules may be a promising therapy strategy for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative illnesses. This study examines the therapeutic potential of DYRK1A inhibitors in AD and offers a thorough explanation of the molecular pathways through which DYRK1A promotes the development of the illness.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39896840,Lipid mediators in post-mortem brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.,"A proposed contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the induction of neuroinflammation due to tau and beta-amyloid protein accumulation causing neuronal injury and dysfunction. Dysregulation of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to this inflammatory response in the brain of patients with AD, yet the literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase and PsychINFO for articles published up to April 22, 2024. Papers were included if they measured levels of lipid mediators and/or enzymes involved in their production in post-mortem brain samples from patients with AD and control without neurological disease. A total of 50 relevant studies were identified. Despite heterogeneity in the results, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, including 5-, 11-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid oxylipins and prostaglandin D2, were significantly higher, while anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4 and DHA-derived docosanoids were significantly lower in brains of patients with AD compared to control (16 studies). Thirty-seven articles reported on enzymes, with 32 reporting values for enzyme level changes between AD and controls. Among the 32 articles, the majority reported on levels of cyclooxygenase (COX) (18/32), with fewer studies reporting on phospholipase (8/32), lipoxygenase (LOX) (4/32) and prostaglandin E synthase (4/32). Enzyme levels also exhibited variability in the literature, with a trend towards elevated expression of enzymes involved in the pro-inflammatory response, including COX and LOX enzymes. Overall, these results are consistent with the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD measured by lipid mediators. However, the specific contribution of each lipid metabolite and enzymes to either the progression or persistence of AD remains unclear, and more research is required.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2025
40111937,Cost-effectiveness of diagnosing and treating patients with early Alzheimer's disease with anti-amyloid treatment in a clinical setting.,"BackgroundThe introduction of anti-amyloid treatments (AAT) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has put the cost-effectiveness into focus.ObjectiveEstimate the potential cost-effectiveness of diagnostic pathways combined with AAT for early AD.MethodsDiagnostic accuracy of blood-based (BBM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers was obtained from Norwegian memory clinics using positron emission tomography (PET) as reference standard. In a health-economic model, the cost-effectiveness of three diagnostic strategies was estimated relying either on BBM (p-tau 217), CSF (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> ratio), and BBM with CSF confirmatory testing and compared with standard of care (SoC) and compared with CSF-AAT. The model consisted of a decision tree reflecting the diagnostic process and a subsequent Markov cohort model starting at mild cognitive impairment due to AD. All strategies except SoC were combined with AAT including costs of treatment (assumed €5000/year), infusions and monitoring.ResultsCompared with SoC all three strategies (CSF-AAT, BBM-AAT, and BBM-CSF-AAT) resulted in QALY gains at higher costs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 110k€, 141k€ and 110k€ respectively. Compared with CSF-AAT both BBM-AAT and BBM-CSF-AAT strategies resulted in QALYs lost at lower costs, with an ICER of 27k€ and 109k€ respectively. Results were particularly sensitive to the price of AAT and possible subcutaneous administration.ConclusionsCompared with SoC all three strategies are potentially not cost-effective as they exceeded the Swedish maximum willingness to pay threshold of €94,800 per QALY gained. BBM-CSF-AAT versus CSF-AAT is potentially cost-effective if willing to accept its QALY loss. Discussions on budget impact on different payers are needed after introducing AAT.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40026008,Effects of exercise on older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a significantly elevated risk of progressing to AD. In recent years, accumulating evidence has indicated that exercise interventions may mitigate cognitive decline in individuals with MCI and reduce the risk of conversion to AD, potentially through mechanisms such as enhancing cerebral blood flow and promoting neuroplasticity. Objective: To explore which type of exercise is most effective in improving global cognition in older adults with MCI and to investigate whether exercise can enhance their balance abilities. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were retrieved from four databases. Stata software was used for Network Meta-Analysis and traditional meta-analysis. Results: A total of 33 studies were included, of which 28 were used to determine the best exercise modality. The results indicated that multicomponent exercise (SUCRA = 76.5%) and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (SUCRA = 73.6%) are two effective modalities. The results of the traditional meta-analysis showed that exercise combined with cognitive training, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and land-based kayaking training can improve balance ability. Conclusions: Multicomponent exercise may be the optimal exercise modality for enhancing global cognition in older adults with MCI, and various exercise modalities can improve balance abilities. However, more studies with larger sample sizes and higher quality are needed to provide further evidence.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40095069,Biofluid-based staging of Alzheimer's disease.,"Recently, conceptual systems for the in vivo staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using fluid biomarkers have been suggested. Thus, it is important to assess whether available fluid biomarkers can successfully stage AD into clinically and biologically relevant categories. In the TRIAD cohort, we explored whether p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau (biomarkers of early, intermediate and late AD pathology, respectively) have potential for biofluid-based staging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 219) and plasma (n = 150), and compared them in a paired CSF and plasma subset (n = 76). Our findings suggest a good concordance between biofluid staging and underlying pathology when classifying amyloid-positivity into three categories based on neurofibrillary pathology: minimal/non-existent (p-tau217 positive), early-to-intermediate (p-tau217 and p-tau205 positivity), and advanced tau tangle deposition (p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau positive), as indexed by tau-PET. Discordant cases accounted for 4.6% and 13.3% of all CSF and plasma measurements respectively (9.2% and 11.8% in paired samples). Notably, CSF- and plasma-based staging matched one another in 61.7% of the cases, while approximately 32% of the remaining participants were one to three biofluid stages higher in CSF as compared to plasma. Overall, these exploratory results suggest that biofluid staging of AD holds potential for offering valuable insights into underlying AD hallmarks and disease severity. However, its applicability beyond molecular characterization at research settings has yet to be demonstrated.",Acta Neuropathol,2025
40008231,Evaluation of machine learning models for the prediction of Alzheimer's: In search of the best performance.,"Alzheimer's is a progressive and degenerative disease affecting millions worldwide, incapacitating them physically and cognitively. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of Machine Learning models to determine the model with the best performance in predicting Alzheimer's disease. The models used were Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR). Two datasets called OASIS were used to train the models, the first one had a total of 436 records and 12 variables, while the second one stored 373 records and 15 variables. The article's content is divided into six main sections: introduction, literature review, methodological approach, results, discussions, and conclusions. After processing and pooling the datasets, RF, SVM, and LR proved the best predictors, achieving 96% accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. This study highlights the efficacy of RF, SVM, and LR in predicting Alzheimer's disease, offering a significant advance toward understanding and management of this disease, which supports the relevance of implementing these models in future research and clinical applications.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2025
39897619,Case Report: A 3' splice site variation in RORB exon 3 associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in a child.,"The RORB (Retinoic Acid Receptor-related orphan receptor β) gene plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and is strongly associated with bipolar disorder, cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, RORB has also emerged as a novel potential gene involved in generalized epilepsy and absence seizures. However, due to the complexity of RORB gene function, reports on pathogenic variations of RORB genes are still lacking. In this study, we present a case of a 5-year-old epilepsy patient. Through trio whole-exome sequencing, a heterozygous variant was identified at the splice site of 3' end of exon 3 in the RORB gene (chr9:77249546, NM_006914.3: c.94-1G&gt;A). This c.94-1G&gt;A variant disrupts normal mRNA splicing, leading to the premature termination of the RORB protein. According to ACMG guidelines, this variant is classified as ""likely pathogenic"". Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of previously reported pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in RORB, contributing to the growing body of evidence linking this gene to epilepsy. Our findings offer valuable insights into the role of RORB in epilepsy pathogenesis, and the splice site variant identified in this study further expands the mutational spectrum of the RORB gene.",Front Genet,2024
39833340,Sex-modulated association between thyroid stimulating hormone and informant-perceived anxiety in non-depressed older adults: Prediction models and relevant cutoff value.,"The aim of this study was to assess the association between thyroid function and perceived anxiety in non-depressed older adults. Non-depressed Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants with complete Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI/NPI-Q) were included. The association between anxiety and thyroid function was assessed by logistic regression and sex stratification. Restricted cubic splines were applied to evaluate non-linearity in the association. The median age of 2,114 eligible participants was 73 years (68-78), 1,117 (52.84%) were males, and the median TSH was 1.69 µIU/mL. There was a significant association between TSH and informant-perceived anxiety in the total study population (OR<sub>Model1</sub> = 0.86, 95%CI 0.76-0.97, p = 0.011), even after adjusting for bio-demographical (adj.OR<sub>Model2</sub> = 0.85, 95%CI 0.75-0.96, p = 0.007), and socio-cognitive confounders (adj.OR<sub>Model3</sub> = 0.84, 95%CI 0.73-0.96, p = 0.009). Sex-stratification showed similar significant results in all male-specific models (OR<sub>Model1-male</sub> = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.58-0.85, p<sub>Model1-male</sub> &lt; 0.001). In the general population and males, a TSH value of 2.4 µIU/dL was a significant cutoff under which anxiety odds were significantly high, even after adjusting for confounders. The sex-dependent association between TSH levels and perceived anxiety in non-depressed older adults is a novel finding that has to be further explored for a better understanding of the underlying neurobehavioral biology.",Sci Rep,2025
39927718,Whole-genome sequencing reveals the impact of lipid pathway and APOE genotype on brain amyloidosis.,"Amyloid-PET imaging tracks the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits in the brain. Amyloid plaques accumulation may begin 10 to 20 years before the individual experiences clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer's diseases (ad). Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies reported common risk factors associated with brain amyloidosis, suggesting that this endophenotype is driven by genetic variants. However, these loci pinpoint to large genomic regions and the functional variants remain to be identified. To identify new risk factors associated with brain amyloid deposition, we performed whole-genome sequencing on a large cohort of European descent individuals with amyloid PET imaging data (n = 1,888). Gene-based analysis for coding variants was performed using SKAT-O for amyloid PET as a quantitative endophenotype that identified genome-wide significant association for APOE (P = 2.45 × 10-10), and 26 new candidate genes with suggestive significance association (P < 5. 0 × 10-03) including SCN7A (P = 7.31 × 10-05), SH3GL1 (P = 7.56 × 10-04), and MFSD12 (P = 8.51 × 10-04). Enrichment analysis highlighted the lipid binding pathways as associated with Aβ deposition in brain driven by PITPNM3 (P = 4.27 × 10-03), APOE (P = 2.45 × 10-10), AP2A2 (P = 1.06 × 10-03), and SH3GL1 (P = 7.56 × 10-04). Overall, our data strongly support a connection between lipid metabolism and the deposition of Aβ in the brain. Our study illuminates promising avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting lipid metabolism to address brain amyloidosis.",Hum Mol Genet,2025
39961166,Exploring morphological and microstructural signatures across the Alzheimer's spectrum and risk factors.,"Neural alterations, including myelin degeneration and inflammation-related iron burden, may accompany early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. This study aims to identify multi-modal signatures associated with MRI-derived atrophy and quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures of myelin and iron in a unique dataset of 158 participants across the AD spectrum, including those without cognitive impairment, at familial risk for AD, with mild cognitive impairment, and with AD dementia. Our results revealed a brain pattern with decreased cortical thickness, indicating increased neuronal death, and compromised hippocampal integrity due to reduced myelin content. This pattern was associated with lifestyle factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and anxiety, as well as older age, AD progression, and APOE-ɛ4 carrier status. These findings underscore the value of qMRI metrics as a non-invasive tool, offering sensitivity to lifestyle-related modifiable risk factors and medical history, even in preclinical stages of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39834247,Obstructive sleep apnea is a common diagnosis in patients admitted at the memory clinic: Please screen for it!,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects a large portion of middle-aged and older adults. It has been linked to increased risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. OSA can impair cognitive performance and patients with cognitive complaints can frequently present with this sleep disorder. Although instruments able for correctly screening patients with cognitive impairment and OSA exist, there is no evidence about utility and feasibility of their use in the memory clinics. The study by Lam et al. showed that, in case of impossibility of performing polysomnography-that is the gold standard for OSA diagnosis, pulse oximetry can represent a good instrument for screening patients with cognitive impairment for OSA, and they do not advice for using sleep interview or STOP-Bang questionnaire for screening this sleep disorder.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40156298,Plasma protein risk scores for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the Framingham heart study.,"INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether aggregated plasma protein risk scores (PPRSs) could be useful in predicting the risks of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: The Cox proportional hazard model with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator penalty was used to build the PPRSs for MCI and AD in 1515 Framingham Heart Study Generation 2 with 1128 proteins measured in plasma at exam 5 (cognitively normal [CN] = 1258, MCI = 129, AD = 128).
RESULTS: MCI PPRS had a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.97 [5.34, 9.12], with a discriminating power (C-index = 82.52%). AD PPRS had a HR of 5.74 [4.67, 7.05] (C-index = 88.15%). Both PPRSs were also significantly associated with cognitive changes, brain atrophy, and plasma AD biomarkers. Proteins in the MCI and AD PPRSs were involved in several pathways related to leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that PPRSs serve well to predict the risk of developing MCI and AD as well as cognitive changes and AD-related pathogenesis in the brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: PPRSs were developed for the risk of AD and AD preclinical stage, MCI. PPRSs were developed for MCI and AD associated with cognitive changes, loss of brain volume, and increasing level of plasma AD biomarkers. Leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration enriched in proteins were identified as being involved in MCI and AD PPRSs.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40145568,Integrating home-based video teleneuropsychology into neurology clinical practice: Utility in patients with suspected typical or atypical Alzheimer's disease presentations.,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the reliability of home-based video teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) compared to face-to-face (FF) neuropsychological assessments in clinic-referred patients for whom a typical or atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD) syndrome was on the neurologist's differential diagnosis.
METHOD: We conducted a randomized, cross-over clinical trial in which participants underwent neuropsychological evaluations with a core battery of tests in two modalities: FF and TeleNP, conducted approximately 4-6 wk apart. Participants included patients ≥ age 60 years and &lt;90 years who were undergoing evaluation in a memory disorders clinic (n = 63). Board-certified neuropsychologists submitted diagnostic impressions (i.e. syndrome and severity classifications) after the core battery in each modality. Neuropsychologists were able to include a flexible assessment (i.e. inclusion of tests not readily adaptable to TeleNP) after the core battery, only in the FF condition.
RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were at least moderate to good (≥0.50) for 91% of administered tests. Computing ICC adjusting for alternate forms, sequence order, practice effects, referring diagnostic complexity, and supervising neuropsychologist did not substantively change interpretation of ICCs. Across modality types, Cohen's kappa of neuropsychologist impressions for syndrome classifications was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.88), and for severity classifications was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.99). Within the FF modality, kappa of neuropsychologist impressions was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.0), respectively, for syndrome and severity across core and flexible batteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Home-based, video TeleNP is a reliable alternative to FF neuropsychological assessment in older adult patients with suspected cognitive impairment.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
39930142,Phospho-tau serine-262 and serine-356 as biomarkers of pre-tangle soluble tau assemblies in Alzheimer's disease.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with little or no quantifiable insoluble brain tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology demonstrate stronger clinical benefits of therapies than those with advanced NFTs. The formation of NFTs can be prevented by targeting the intermediate soluble tau assemblies (STAs). However, biochemical understanding and biomarkers of STAs are lacking. We show that Tris-buffered saline-soluble tau aggregates from autopsy-verified AD brain tissues include the core sequence ~tau<sub>258-368</sub>. In neuropathological assessments, antibodies against the phosphorylation sites serine-262 and serine-356 within the STA core almost exclusively stained granular (that is, prefibrillar) tau aggregates in pre-NFTs while antibodies against phosphorylation at serine-202 and threonine-205 and threonine-231, outside the STA core, stained the entire spectrum of tau aggregates in pre-NFTs and mature NFTs, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads in the hippocampus. Functionally, a recombinantly produced STA core peptide robustly altered neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal brain slices. Furthermore, we developed a cerebrospinal fluid assay that differentiated STAs in AD from non-AD tauopathies, correlated with the severity of NFT burden and cognitive decline independently of amyloid beta deposition, and with tau positron emission tomography uptake across Braak NFT stages. Together, our findings inform about the status of early-stage tau aggregation, reveal aggregation-relevant phosphorylation epitopes in tau and offer a diagnostic biomarker and targeted therapeutic opportunities for AD.",Nat Med,2025
39764113,Comparison of Ensemble Techniques for Early Prediction of Alzhiemer Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by a loss in cognitive functions, with no disease-modifying medication now available. It is crucial for early detection and treatment of Alzheimer's disease before clinical manifestation. The stage between cognitively healthy older persons and AD is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To predict the transition from one-stage MCI to probable AD, five ensemble learning approach was used (Stacking, Gradient boost Bagging, Adaptive boost and Voting), an integrated model that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). The adaptive boost, stacking and bagging ensemble approach has shown potential to identify those at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, this would benefit them the most from a clinical trial or to use as a stratification approach inside clinical trials.",Res Sq,2024
40151397,Combination therapy targeting Alzheimer's disease risk factors is associated with a significant delay in Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline can be a major contributor to loss of independent living. Therapeutic strategies that alter the course of cognitive deterioration have the potential to sustain activities of daily living, promote quality of life, and delay transition to nursing-home care.
METHODS: We performed longitudinal linear regression analysis of National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) cognitive data from 7653 mild dementia AD participants at baseline with at least one medication for diabetes (DBMD), lipid-lowering (LIPL), anti-hypertensive (AHTN), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSD) medications or any combination in 5684 (74%) participants and in 1969 (26%) participants with no study-relevant prescriptions over 10 years. Change in cognitive function was determined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores relative to non-treated participants stratified by sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Validation analysis was performed using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.
RESULTS: Combination of DBMD+LIPL+AHTN+NSD (QuadRx) resulted in a significant 46% MMSE and 32% CDR-SB delay in cognitive decline at 5 years, which was sustained at 10 years with a delay in decline of 47% MMSE and 33% CDR-SB. QuadRx was equally effective for the delay of cognitive decline in both females and males at 5 and 10 years. QuadRx mitigated the impact of the APOE ε4 genotype. Findings were validated in ADNI AD participants in which QuadRx was associated with a significant 60% MMSE delay in cognitive decline at 1 and 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was associated with a significant delay in cognitive decline in NACC AD participants at a magnitude comparable to or greater than amyloid beta immunomodulators. Further, the delay in decline was sustained for 10 years. The impact of QuadRx to delay cognitive decline was validated in deeply characterized ADNI participants. These data support combination therapy in persons with AD risk factors to alter the course of AD that persists for a decade, enabling cognitive function at a magnitude associated with independent living.
HIGHLIGHTS: QuadRx slowed Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline by 47% in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center NACC and 60% in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI participants.Combination therapy exhibited additive and synergistic slowing of cognitive decline.QuadRx was equally effective in females and males at 5 and 10 years.QuadRx mitigated the impact of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype.QuadRx was effective in AD participants reporting drug use for their AD risk factor.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40165376,One-year exercise improves cognition and fitness and decreases vascular stiffness and reactivity to CO2 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"BackgroundAmnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is often a precursor stage to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aerobic exercise (AE) has received increasing attention in the prevention of AD. While there is some evidence that it improves neurocognitive function in older individuals, the effect of exercise in the long-term is not well understood.ObjectiveTo assess the effect of long-term exercise on cognition, fitness, vascular stiffness, and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).MethodsIn this prospective clinical trial, 27 aMCI participants were enrolled into two groups and underwent 12 months of intervention. One group (n = 11) underwent AE training (6M/5F, age = 66.2 years), and the control group (n = 16) performed stretch training (ST group, 9M/7F, age = 66.4 years). Both groups performed training three times per week with duration and intensity gradually increased over time. CVR was measured at pre- and post-training using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent MRI.ResultsIn the AE group, aerobic fitness improved (p = 0.034) and carotid artery stiffness decreased (p = 0.005), which was not observed in the ST group. In all participants, decreases in carotid artery stiffness were associated with increases in aerobic fitness (p = 0.043). The AE group displayed decreases in CVR in the anterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, FWE corrected); the ST group did not show significant changes in CVR. Several measures of cognition (i.e., inhibition and delayed recall), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functional status ratings improved only in the AE group.ConclusionsThese results suggest that AE may alter cerebral hemodynamics in patients with aMCI which may improve cognitive, psychological, and functional status.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40189825,Deciding on genetic testing for familial dementia: Perspectives of patients and families.,"INTRODUCTION: We explored patients' and families' interest in, predictors of, and considerations regarding genetic testing for monogenic causes of dementia in a diagnostic setting.
METHODS: This mixed-methods study evaluated 519 consecutive Alzheimer Center Amsterdam patients for monogenic testing eligibility. Among those qualifying, differences between testers and non-testers were analyzed. Thirty-three patients completed questionnaires. Additionally, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with 15 patients and 18 relatives. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed inductively.
RESULTS: Of 138 (27%) eligible patients (46% female, age 61 ± 8 years, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 22 ± 6), 75 (54%) underwent genetic testing. Testers had better cognition, higher quality of life, and more often undetermined diagnoses than non-testers (all p < 0.05). Decisions were guided by intuitive, value-driven judgments: testers sought to provide heredity information to relatives, enhance actionability, and reduce uncertainty, while non-testers worried about psychosocial impact on family, or unfavorable timing.
DISCUSSION: The substantial interest in genetic testing for monogenic causes of dementia underscores the need for further research into the implications of disclosing test results to memory clinic patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Half of memory clinic patients' who met eligibility criteria proceeded with genetic testing. Those tested were more likely to have an undetermined diagnosis, better cognition, and higher quality of life. Decisions were motivated less by deliberation of factual information, and more by quick, intuitive judgments. Motivations pro included providing information, enhancing actionability, and resolving uncertainty. Motivations con comprised concerns about the emotional burden and disruptive impact on their family.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39880323,The inflammatory profiling in a cohort of older patients suffering from cognitive decline and dementia.,"BACKGROUND: During aging, there is a progressive impairment of immune cell function that triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines causing the so-called ""inflammaging"". Frailty represents a condition of increased vulnerability to stresses and reduced homeostatic reserve reflecting not only health status but also biological age. In older subjects without dementia, we showed that markers of inflammaging were differently associated with chronological age than with frailty. This study analysed the same markers in older people with cognitive decline and/or dementia.
METHODS: The cohort consisted of 776 community-dwelling older people: 235 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 63 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 175 with mixed dementia (MD), and 303 subjects without cognitive decline. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and peripheral markers of neuroinflammation were analysed by next-generation ELISA.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, frailty, education and Apolipoprotein E genotype, only interleukin-10, interleukin-1β, and neurofilament light chain were associated with the risk for AD and MD. Moreover, interleukin-6 showed a weak association only with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed similar associations between AD and MD, supporting the concept that late-onset dementia is a complex outcome of aging, intimately linked to the individual's health status as well as frailty.",Exp Gerontol,2025
39903689,The landscape of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease: global distribution and age of onset.,"We present a comprehensive global analysis of genetic variants associated with autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). A total of 550 variants in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes were identified, of which 279 were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on ACMG-AMP criteria, utilizing data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), literature, and public databases. Symptomatic age at onset (AAO) data was estimated for 227 of these variants, allowing detailed characterization of their frequency, pathogenicity, and AAO. Importantly, 226 variants meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in disease-modifying clinical trials. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive value of mean variant AAO and parental AAO in predicting symptomatic AAO, validated against converters who became symptomatic during follow-up in the DIAN Observational Study (DIAN-OBS). This dataset provides critical insights into the global landscape of ADAD and reveals the genetic and AAO heterogeneity of ADAD variants while refining variant trial eligibility criteria.",Brain,2025
40025710,Frailty in motion: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease cohorts display heterogeneity in multimorbidity classification and longitudinal transitions.,"BACKGROUND: Data-driven examination of multiple morbidities and deficits are informative for clinical and research applications in aging and dementia. Resulting profiles may change longitudinally according to dynamic alterations in extent, duration, and pattern of risk accumulation. Do such frailty-related changes include not only progression but also stability and reversion?
OBJECTIVE: With cognitively impaired and dementia cohorts, we employed data-driven analytics to (a) detect the extent of heterogeneity in frailty-related multimorbidity and deficit burden subgroups and (b) identify key person characteristics predicting differential transition patterns.
METHODS: We assembled baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts. We applied factor analyses to 43 multimorbidity and deficit indicators. Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) was applied to the resulting domains in order to detect subgroups differing in transition patterns for multimorbidity and deficit burden. We characterized heterogeneity in change patterns by evaluating key person characteristics as differential predictors.
RESULTS: Factor analyses revealed five domains at two time points. LTA showed that two latent burden subgroups at Time 1 (Low, Moderate) differentiated into an additional two subgroups at Time 2 (adding Mild, Severe). Transition analyses detected heterogeneous changes, including progression, stability, and reversion. Baseline classifications and transitions varied according to clinical cohort, global cognition, sex, age, and education.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous frailty-related subgroup transitions can be (a) detected in aging adults living with aMCI and AD, (b) characterized as not only progression but also stability and reversion, and (c) predicted by precision characteristics.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40133248,"Decreased practice effects in cognitively unimpaired amyloid betapositive individuals: a multicenter, longitudinal, cohort study.","INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine whether cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid- beta-positive (Aβ+) individuals display decreased practice effects on serial neuropsychological testing.
METHODS: We included 209 CU participants from three research centers, 157 Aβ- controls and 52 Aβ+ individuals. Participants underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline and annually during a 2-year follow-up. We used linear mixed-effects models to analyze cognitive change over time between the two groups, including time from baseline, amyloid status, their interaction, age, sex, and years of education as fixed effects and the intercept and time as random effects.
RESULTS: The Aβ+ group showed reduced practice effects in verbal learning (β = -1.14, SE = 0.40, p = 0.0046) and memory function (β = -0.56, SE = 0.19, p = 0.0035), as well as in language tasks (β = -0.59, SE = 0.19, p = 0.0027).
DISCUSSION: Individuals with normal cognition who are in the Alzheimer's continuum show decreased practice effects over annual neuropsychological testing. Our findings could have implications for the design and interpretation of primary prevention trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: This was a multicenter study on practice effects in asymptomatic Aβ+ individuals. We used LME models to analyze cognitive trajectories across multiple domains. Practice-effects reductions might be an indicator of subtle cognitive decline. Implications on clinical and research settings within the AD field are discussed.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39744521,"Apolipoprotein E dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: a study on miRNA regulation, glial markers, and amyloid pathology.","INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis, predominantly expressed in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in microglia within the central nervous system (CNS). While the APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), its precise role in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Apoe-knockout (Apoe-ko) mice, mice expressing human APOE4, and human APOE4 carriers exhibit similar deficits in lipid metabolism, cognitive and behavioral functions, and neurodegeneration. The retina, as part of the CNS, has been studied to investigate the underlying mechanisms of AD, including neuroinflammation, amyloid aggregation, and neurodegeneration. This study explores ApoE's role in AD by analyzing brain and eye samples from Apoe-ko mice, focusing on identifying potential retinal biomarkers associated with ApoE dysfunction.
METHODS: We compared female Apoe-ko mice on a regular diet to age-matched C57BL/6J controls at 3 and 9 months. Our investigations included microRNAs (miRNAs), their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and selected protein markers, including astroglial (Gfap), microglial/macrophage (Iba1 and Trem2) markers, and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides implicated in AD pathogenesis. We also examined female Apoe-ko mice on a high-fat diet versus a regular diet at 9 months for differential miRNA and mRNA expressions.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that miRNA levels were generally lower in 3-month-old Apoe-ko mice but increased in 9-month-old mice across five distinct brain regions, as well as in eye tissue and tear fluid. A high-fat diet further enhanced miRNA dysregulation in brain and eye tissues, but not in tear fluid. Target mRNAs were generally higher in the neocortex-hippocampus and eye tissue of 3-month-old Apoe-ko mice but decreased with age, except for glial cell mRNAs like Gfap and Aif1. Protein analysis revealed elevated Gfap expression, and increased APP/Aβ peptide accumulation in the neocortex-hippocampus, including brain endothelial cells at the meninges, as well as in the retina of 9-month-old Apoe-ko mice. These findings highlight ApoE's pivotal role in AD, demonstrating its impact on inflammatory and amyloidogenic/angiogenic miRNA expression, glial homeostasis, and APP/Aβ peptide clearance. The observed upregulation of proinflammatory miR-146a and anti-amyloidogenic/angiogenic miR-15a in 9-month-old Apoe-ko mice suggests their potential as tear-based biomarkers for ApoE dysfunction.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39915859,Heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease: a neuropsychological data-driven approach.,"BACKGROUND: The clinical presentations of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease are distinct, with EOAD having a more aggressive disease course with greater heterogeneity. Recent publications from the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) described EOAD as predominantly amnestic, though this phenotypic description was based solely on clinical judgment. To better understand the phenotypic range of EOAD presentation, we applied a neuropsychological data-driven method to subtype the LEADS cohort.
METHODS: Neuropsychological test performance from 169 amyloid-positive EOAD participants were analyzed. Education-corrected normative comparisons were made using a sample of 98 cognitively normal participants. Comparing the relative levels of impairment between each cognitive domain, we applied a cut-off of 1 SD below all other domain scores to indicate a phenotype of ""predominant"" impairment in a given cognitive domain. Individuals were otherwise considered to have multidomain impairment. Whole-cortex general linear modeling of cortical atrophy was applied as an MRI-based validation of these distinct clinical phenotypes.
RESULTS: We identified 6 phenotypic subtypes of EOAD: Dysexecutive Predominant (22% of sample), Amnestic Predominant (11%), Language Predominant (11%), Visuospatial Predominant (15%), Mixed Amnestic/Dysexecutive Predominant (11%), and Multidomain (30%). These phenotypes did not differ by age, sex, or years of education. The APOE ɛ4 genotype was enriched in the Amnestic Predominant group, who were also rated as least impaired. Cortical thickness analysis validated these clinical phenotypes with dissociations in atrophy patterns observed between the Dysexecutive and Amnestic Predominant groups. In contrast to the heterogeneity observed from our neuropsychological data-driven approach, diagnostic classifications for this same sample based solely on clinical judgment indicated that 82% of individuals were amnestic-predominant, 9% were non-amnestic, 4% met criteria for Posterior Cortical Atrophy, and 5% met criteria for Primary Progressive Aphasia.
CONCLUSION: A neuropsychological data-driven method to phenotype EOAD individuals uncovered a more detailed understanding of the presenting heterogeneity in this atypical AD sample compared to clinical judgment alone. Clinicians and patients may over-report memory dysfunction at the expense of non-memory symptoms. These findings have important implications for diagnostic accuracy and treatment considerations.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40051009,TREM2 risk variants and associated endophenotypes in alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Rare variants of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) gene are strong risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and drugs targeting the TREM2 protein are being developed. However, it is unknown what the effect of TREM2 variants is on the AD phenotype.
METHODS: Here we studied a full range of clinical and biomarker measures in a large cohort of TREM2 variant carriers (n = 123, 7.8%, i.e., R62H n = 66, R47H n = 26, T96K n = 16, other TREM2 variants n = 17) compared to confirmed non-carriers (n = 1,459) with biomarker confirmed symptomatic AD from Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Secondly, we explored whether specific TREM2 variants were associated with distinct clinical measures compared to the reference group, i.e. non-carriers, within the same cohort.
RESULTS: TREM2 variant carriers (64 ± 7 years, 54% female) did not show distinct clinical measures of AD at presentation compared to AD patients not carrying a TREM2 variant (64 ± 7 years, 52% female). We observed no differences in MMSE, neuropsychological domains (except less impaired visuospatial functioning in TREM2 carriers), MRI scores, CSF biomarkers, EEG, structural MRI (41 ROIs) and Tau-PET scans of four carriers (R62H, R47H, G58A, D87N). Carriers did show faster cognitive decline (MMSE points per year 0.6 ± 0.3, P <sub>fdr</sub> = 0.099) compared to non-carriers. Notably, both R47H and T96K carriers exhibited faster cognitive decline (P &lt; 0.05), and R47H carriers even showed an increased rate of death after diagnosis (P = 0.034). In contrast to the shared cognitive decline, these variants showed different results for other measures at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that while carriers of TREM2 risk variants cannot be distinguished based on clinical presentation at baseline compared to non-carriers, they do exhibit a faster global cognitive decline. Variant-specific analyses indicate that especially R47H and T96K carriers drive this association. These results highlight the importance of considering variant-specific effects for understanding the role of TREM2 biology in AD. The rich phenotype information can inform clinical stage drug development.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39998266,The Nun Study: Insights from 30 years of aging and dementia research.,"The Nun Study is an iconic longitudinal study of aging and dementia on a cohort of 678 Catholic nuns from the School Sisters of Notre Dame. Participants consented to undergoing annual neuropsychological assessments, allowing researchers access to convent archives and medical records and post mortem brain donation. This study investigated the associations between epidemiological factors, cognitive function, and brain pathology. By examining published literature that reports on or utilizes Nun Study data, we provide an overview of its methodology and key findings, emphasizing its significant contributions to understanding cognitive impairment and related neuropathologies. Seminal findings on early-life factors affecting cognitive health, clinicopathological correlations, and apparent resistance and resilience to neuropathology are discussed. Decades of Nun Study research have made critical contributions to our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and highlight continuing objectives for future research. HIGHLIGHTS: The uniform lifestyles of participants minimized potential confounds of the study. Early-life cognitive ability influenced late-life cognitive outcomes. Some participants with AD pathology did not exhibit dementia. Neuropathological comorbidities were common and increased the risk of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40042496,Predicted natural progression as an Alzheimer's prognostic covariate improves the precision of lecanemab efficacy assessments and clinical trial efficiency.,"BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression introduces variability in treatment effect assessments. Using predicted future progression as an AD prognostic covariate (APC) may reduce this variability. This study evaluates this strategy in lecanemab trials and its implications for AD trial design.
METHODS: Two APCs were derived at baseline for each trial participant from published models with historical controls: one with clinical features, the other adding structural MRI features. Their impact on estimating the difference in cognitive decline between the treatment and placebo arms and the time saved from delayed progression (TSDP) was assessed.
RESULTS: Incorporating either APC reduced variance estimates by up to 19.1% across phase II and phase III trials, increased power to 90.2%, and reduced sample size by 27.2%. These APCs improved treatment effect estimates and TSDP, demonstrating broad applicability across endpoints.
DISCUSSION: APCs enhance treatment effect evaluation, improve statistical power, and reduce required sample sizes in Alzheimer's trials.
GOV IDENTIFIERS: NCT01767311 (Lecanemab Study 201), NCT03887455 (Lecanemab Study 301; ClarityAD).
HIGHLIGHTS: Baseline prediction of future progression can serve as an APC for treatment effect assessments. These predictions can be derived from progression models developed using external controls. APC accounts for heterogeneity in progression among trial participants, improving treatment effect estimates. Enhanced accuracy and precision were observed across lecanemab phase II and phase III trials for various endpoints. This approach results in substantial increase in statistical power and reduced sample size for future AD trials.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40087862,Amyloid-β Dysregulates Oligodendroglial Lineage Cell Dynamics and Myelination via PKC in the Zebrafish Spinal Cord.,"Soluble forms of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide have been proposed as candidates to induce oligodendrocyte (OL) and myelin dysfunctions in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Nevertheless, little is known about how Aβ affects OL differentiation and myelination in vivo, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Aβ on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Aβ altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbpa:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Aβ increased the number of myrf<sup>+</sup> and mbp<sup>+</sup> OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Aβ also increased the number of Sox10<sup>+</sup>cells, myelin sheaths per OL, and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord at 8 dpf compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Aβ-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Gö6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels. Altogether, not only do we demonstrate that Aβ induces a precocious oligodendroglial differentiation leading to dysregulated myelination, but we also identified PKC as a key player in Aβ-induced pathology.",Glia,2025
39827219,Novel synaptic markers predict early tau pathology and cognitive deficit in an asymptomatic population at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates closely with pathology in the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau pathology may spread via neural synapses. In a population of cognitively unimpaired elderly at elevated risk of AD, we investigated four cerebrospinal (CSF) markers of synaptic dysfunction and degeneration. Three of these (SYT1, SNAP25, and ADAM23) are derived from pre-synaptic structures, while ADAM22 reflects post-synaptic changes. All four markers correlated strongly with tau protein measures. In statistical models, SYT1 accounted for more than half the total variance in both total- and P(181)-tau levels. Observed correlations with CSF levels of Alzheimer amyloid-β (Aβ42) were somewhat weaker. In longitudinal data, baseline levels of ADAM22 and ADAM23 robustly predicted increase over time in both total- and P-tau. CSF SYT1 levels also correlated with PET image uptake of tau and (at a trend level) Aβ in areas of interest for early AD pathology. CSF SYT1 and SNAP25 levels correlated inversely with a global psychometric score and several of its domain subscales. In quantitative trait loci analyses, all four synaptic markers were associated with at least one AD genetic risk locus. Upon ""staging"" participants by their evidence of amyloid and tau pathology (A/T/N framework), the CSF synaptic markers were unexpectedly reduced in participants with CSF evidence of amyloid but not tau pathology. They were clearly elevated, however, in the CSF of persons with indications of both tau and amyloid pathology. These observations provide evidence for clear pre-synaptic degeneration in cognitively unimpaired persons with biomarker evidence of early AD pathology.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
39841807,Amyloid-associated hyperconnectivity drives tau spread across connected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-β (Aβ) triggers the aggregation and spreading of tau pathology, which drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. However, the pathophysiological link between Aβ and tau remains unclear, which hinders therapeutic efforts to attenuate Aβ-related tau accumulation. Aβ has been found to trigger neuronal hyperactivity and hyperconnectivity, and preclinical research has shown that tau spreads across connected neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Here, we hypothesized that neuronal hyperactivity and hypersynchronicity, resulting in functional connectivity increases, constitute a crucial mechanism by which Aβ facilitates the spreading of tau pathology. By combining Aβ positron emission tomography (PET), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and longitudinal tau-PET in 69 cognitively normal amyloid-negative controls and 140 amyloid-positive patients covering the AD spectrum, we confirmed that Aβ induces hyperconnectivity of temporal lobe tau epicenters to posterior brain regions that are vulnerable to tau accumulation in AD. This was replicated in an independent sample of 55 controls and 345 individuals with preclinical AD and low cortical tau-PET uptake, suggesting that the emergence of Aβ-related hyperconnectivity precedes neocortical tau spreading . Last, using longitudinal tau-PET and mediation analysis, we confirmed that these Aβ-related connectivity increases in tau epicenters to typical tau-vulnerable brain regions in AD mediated the effect of Aβ on faster tau accumulation, unveiling increased connectivity as a potential causal link between the two AD hallmark pathologies. Together, these findings suggest that Aβ promotes tau spreading by eliciting neuronal hyperconnectivity and that targeting Aβ-related neuronal hyperconnectivity may attenuate tau spreading in AD.",Sci Transl Med,2025
39887549,The higher benefit of lecanemab in males compared to females in CLARITY AD is probably due to a real sex effect.,"INTRODUCTION: The phase 3 trial CLARITY AD found lecanemab slowed cognitive decline by 27%. However, subgroup analyses indicated a significant 31% sex difference in the effect and suggested no or limited effectiveness in females. We used simulations constrained by the trial design to determine whether that difference reflects a pre-existing sex difference in Alzheimer's disease progression or was a random event.
METHODS: Simulations were generated using linear mixed models of cognitive decline fit to data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants satisfying CLARITY AD inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The statistically non-significant 7.9% smaller cognitive decline rate in our cohort's males versus females does not explain CLARITY AD's 31% sex difference in lecanemab's effect. A ≥ 31% difference occurred randomly in only 12 of our 10,000 simulations (0.0012 probability).
DISCUSSION: CLARITY AD's sex difference was probably not random. Lecanemab is likely less effective in females than males, but we cannot conclude the drug is ineffective in females.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lecanemab is more clinically effective in males than in females. Forest plots should only report subgroup-specific effects in well-powered subgroups. Trial simulations based on real data enable investigation of subgroup drug effects. We cannot conclude that lecanemab is clinically ineffective in females. A sex difference in lecanemab's efficacy could be linked to its action mechanism.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40042520,Systematic review and meta-analysis of bulk RNAseq studies in human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue.,"UNLABELLED: We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies comparing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to controls in human brain tissue. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for human brain bulk RNAseq studies, excluding re-analyses and studies limited to small RNAs or gene panels. We developed 10 criteria for quality assessment and performed a meta-analysis on three high-quality datasets. Of 3266 records, 24 qualified for the systematic review, and one study with three datasets qualified for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis identified 571 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal lobe and 189 in the frontal lobe, including CLU and GFAP. Pathway analysis suggested reactivation of developmental processes in the adult AD brain. Limited data availability constrained the meta-analysis. These findings underscore the need for rigorous methods in AD transcriptomic research to better identify transcriptomic changes and advance biomarker and therapeutic development. This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023466522).
HIGHLIGHTS: Comprehensive review: Conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies comparing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with non-demented controls using primary human brain tissue.
KEY FINDINGS: Identified 571 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal lobe and 189 in the frontal lobe of patients with AD, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Pathway discovery: Highlighted key overlapping pathways such as ""tube morphogenesis"" and ""neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction"" that may play critical roles in AD.
QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Emphasized the importance of methodological rigor in transcriptomic studies, including quality assessment tools to guide future research in AD.
STUDY LIMITATION: Acknowledged limited access to complete data tables and lack of diversity in existing datasets, which constrained some of the analysis.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40120042,The HDL-Mimetic Peptide 4F Mitigates Vascular and Cortical Amyloid Pathology and Associated Neuroinflammation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Despite recent advances, more effective and safer treatment options for AD are needed. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral vasculature and is associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. CAA is also considered to underlie the main adverse effect of recently FDA-approved anti-Aβ immunotherapies, namely the amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Substantial evidence has shown that elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein component, APOA-I, are associated with reduced CAA and superior cognitive function. 4F is an APOA-I/HDL-mimetic peptide and its clinical safety and activity have been demonstrated in human trials for cardiovascular diseases. The present study investigates whether treatment with 4F modulates CAA and associated cognitive deficits and neuropathologies in the well-established Tg-SwDI mouse model of CAA/AD. Age/sex-matched Tg-SwDI mice received daily treatments of 4F or vehicle (PBS), respectively, by intraperitoneal injections for 12 weeks. The results showed that 4F treatment reduced overall Aβ plaque deposition and CAA, and attenuated CAA-associated microgliosis, without significantly affecting total levels of Aβ, astrocytosis, and behavioral function. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed a heightened inflammatory state in the brain of SwDI mice and that 4F treatment reversed the overactivation of vascular cells, in particular vascular smooth muscle cells, relieving cerebrovascular inflammation in CAA/AD mice. Our study provides experimental evidence for the therapeutic potential of 4F to mitigate CAA and associated pathologies in AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39849058,"A de novo, mosaic and complex chromosome 21 rearrangement causes APP triplication and familial autosomal dominant early onset Alzheimer disease.","Copy number variation (CNV) of the amyloid-β precursor protein gene (APP) is a known cause of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD), but de novo genetic variants causing ADAD are rare. We report a mother and daughter with neuropathologically confirmed definite Alzheimer disease (AD) and extensive cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Copy number analysis identified an increased number of APP copies and genome sequencing (GS) revealed the underlying complex genomic rearrangement (CGR) including a triplication of APP with two unique breakpoint junctions (BPJs). The mosaic state in the mother had likely occurred de novo. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) on 42 different tissues, including 17 different brain regions, showed the derivative chromosome at varying mosaic levels (20-96%) in the mother who had symptom onset at age 58 years. In contrast, the derivative chromosome was present in all analyzed cells in the daughter whose symptom onset was at 34 years. This study reveals the architecture of a de novo CGR causing APP triplication and ADAD with a striking difference in age at onset between the fully heterozygous daughter compared to the mosaic mother. The GS analysis identified the complexity of the CGR illustrating its usefulness in identifying structural variants (SVs) in neurodegenerative disorders.",Sci Rep,2025
39783876,Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with worse levels of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in APOE ε4-carrying women: An observational study.,"INTRODUCTION: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), along with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, has been suggested as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between MHT and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers is unknown: we investigated this association, and whether APOE ε4 carrier status moderates it.
METHODS: In an observational study of 136 cognitively unimpaired female participants (M<sub>age</sub> = 66.0; standard deviation = 6.3), we examined whether MHT use alone or in interaction with APOE ε4 carrier status was associated with CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid beta (Aβ)40, Aβ42, p-tau/Aβ42, and Aβ42/40 ratios.
RESULTS: Significant interactions were found between APOE ε4 and MHT use for CSF biomarkers. APOE ε4 carriers who were MHT users showed worse levels of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratios than all other users and non-users.
DISCUSSION: The presence of both APOE ε4 and MHT may be associated with elevated amyloid deposition and AD pathology in this sample of participants who demonstrated high familial AD risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Significant interactions were found between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (p-tau)/amyloid beta (Aβ)42 and Aβ42/40 ratios. APOE ε4 carriers who were MHT users showed worse levels of CSF biomarkers than non-users and non-carriers, both users and non-users. Younger age at MHT initiation was associated with worse levels of the p-tau/Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratios in carriers only. The presence of both APOE ε4 carriage and MHT use may be associated with elevated amyloid deposition and AD pathology. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the differences observed in the current study.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39956943,GABA-activated slow spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents are decreased in dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells in an aged mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundSynaptic transmission dysfunction is associated with a range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic inhibition in AD has not been fully explored.ObjectiveWe studied basal, GABA-activated slow spontaneous synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in the dorsal hippocampus of an AD mouse model (tg-APPSwe) and investigated insulin's modulatory effects.MethodsGABA-activated slow sIPSCs were recorded in the DG granule cells by whole-cell patch--clamp recordings in dorsal hippocampal brain slices from 5-6 (adult) and 10-12 (aged) months old wild-type (WT) and AD mice, in the presence or absence of insulin (1 nM).ResultsThe median 10-90% rise time of slow sIPSCs significantly decreased with age (10-12 months vs. 5-6 months) only in AD mice. The median amplitude of the slow sIPSCs was decreased in adult and aged AD mice as compared to WT mice whereas the slow sIPSCs frequency was only reduced in the aged WT mice. The median 63% decay time and total current density of the slow IPSCs was significantly decreased in the aged AD mice as compared to both WT mice and to the adult AD mice. Insulin application exerted no effect on slow sIPSCs properties in any of the animal groups.ConclusionsThe characteristics of the slow sIPSCs recorded in DG granule cells of dorsal hippocampus from WT and AD mice are altered by age- and disease-state, whereas insulin has negligible effects.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39967041,Rapid cognitive assessment: Accuracy and discriminant validity of Mini-Cog and process-based Clock Drawing Test.,"BackgroundThe Mini-Cog is a brief cognitive examination comprising a three-item memory recall and a simplified Clock Drawing Test (CDT). There is limited research on the effects of detailed scoring criteria for the Mini-Cog on cognitive screening.ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic effectiveness of three Mini-Cog versions and a new process-based CDT test in identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively normal controls (NC).MethodsWe prospectively enrolled 950 subjects who underwent standardized neuropsychological assessments and the Mini-Cog test. The CDT was scored using an adapted 10-point scale. The accuracy of three Mini-Cog versions (Mini-Cog1: 3-word delayed recall + 2-point CDT; Mini-Cog2: 3-word immediate recall + 3-word delayed recall + 3-point CDT; Mini-Cog3: 3-word immediate recall + 3-word delayed recall + 10-point CDT) was assessed through the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for each diagnostic threshold.ResultsThe optimal cut-off point for Mini-Cog3 is 12/16 for MCI and 10/16 for AD. Mini-Cog3 demonstrated the highest diagnostic efficacy, with AUCs of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85) for MCI and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97) for AD, with sensitivity of 85% for both MCI and AD. The CDT's AUCs were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.81) for MCI, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90) for AD, with sensitivity of 89% for MCI, and 82% for AD.ConclusionsA more elaborate scoring system, such as Mini-Cog3, may serve as an effective screening method for the rapid and accurate detection of cognitive dysfunction in patients with MCI and AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39711362,Accelerated ovarian failure results in brain alterations related to Alzheimer's disease that are not recovered by high-intensity interval training in mice.,"INTRODUCTION: The menopausal decline in ovarian estrogen production is thought to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease; however, this link requires further investigation. The chronological development of this connection is not well defined because of the lack of animal models that recapitulate the time course of menopause. This study characterized the cognitive and neuronal effects of the 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) model of ovarian failure in female mice and assessed whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) would attenuate impairments.
METHODS: Female mice were injected with VCD for 15 days. Novel object recognition tests (NORT) were conducted during (perimenopause) and after (menopause) ovarian failure (n = 7). HIIT was initiated in menopause and mice underwent NORT testing after 2 and 8 weeks of HIIT (n = 5).
RESULTS: VCD mice had a lower discrimination index, and lower SNAP25 and NeuN expression in perimenopause. HIIT did not recover memory in VCD mice.
DISCUSSION: Neuronal changes arise early in the perimenopausal transition and HIIT did not improve recognition memory when initiated in menopause.
HIGHLIGHTS: The menopausal decline in ovarian estrogen production increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The chronological development of this connection is not well defined because of the lack of animal models that recapitulate the time course of menopause. 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD)-induced ovarian failure provides a model that simulates the average human experience in the transition from perimenopause to menopause. We demonstrate that cognitive and biochemical effects related to AD pathology are present from the earliest available timepoint in perimenopause in VCD mice. This work highlights the importance of examining the time course in the progression to menopause and the use of VCD as a model to investigate changes in the brain.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39779912,EBP1 potentiates amyloid β pathology by regulating γ-secretase.,"The abnormal deposition of amyloid β (Aβ), produced by proteolytic cleavage events of amyloid precursor protein involving the protease γ-secretase and subsequent polymerization into amyloid plaques, plays a key role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1)/proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4) interacts with presenilin, a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, inhibiting Aβ production. Mice lacking forebrain Ebp1/Pa2g4 recapitulate the representative phenotypes of late-onset sporadic AD, displaying an age-dependent increase in Aβ deposition, amyloid plaques and cognitive dysfunction. In postmortem brains of patients with AD and 5x-FAD mice, we found that EBP1 is proteolytically cleaved by asparagine endopeptidase at N84 and N204 residues, compromising its inhibitory effect on γ-secretase, increasing Aβ aggregation and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, injection of AAV2-Ebp1 wild-type or an asparagine endopeptidase-uncleavable mutant into the brains of 5x-FAD mice decreased Aβ generation and alleviated the behavioral impairments. Thus, our study suggests that EBP1 acts as an inhibitor of γ-secretase on amyloid precursor protein cleavage and preservation of functional EBP1 could be a therapeutic strategy for AD.",Nat Aging,2025
39894914,Longitudinal and concurrent C-reactive protein and diet associations with cognitive function in the population-based Tromsø study.,"BackgroundImmune dysregulation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease; however, precise mechanisms and timing have not been established.ObjectiveTo investigate the concurrent and longitudinal associations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and dietary inflammatory index (DII) with cognitive decline as observed in Alzheimer's disease.MethodsThe study was based on 7613 individuals who participated in Tromsø6 (2007-2008) and Tromsø7 (2015-2016). We analyzed the relationship between CRP levels, DII, and cognitive function cross-sectionally using linear regression. We used mediation analysis to examine if CRP mediates the effects of DII on cognitive function. Further, we related baseline serum CRP to cognitive function and to change in cognitive function after 7 years of follow up. We used linear mixed models to relate changes in CRP levels to changes in cognitive function measured at two time points with 7 years apart.ResultsBoth CRP level and DII were cross-sectionally inversely associated with cognitive function (psychomotor speed, executive function). There was no prospective relationship between CRP level at baseline and cognitive function after 7 years of follow up. Increase in CRP levels was associated with decrease in cognitive function (psychomotor speed, executive function, and verbal memory) observed between two measurements 7 years apart. The mediation model did not show convincing evidence of a mediating effect of CRP in the association between diet and cognitive function.ConclusionsAfter comprehensive analysis of associations between CRP, DII and cognitive function, we conclude that CRP is likely to reflect the changes in inflammatory environment occurring in parallel with cognitive decline.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39868511,Identifying gait differences between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and their associations with regional amyloid deposition.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to compare gait between individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals and to evaluate the association between gait and regional amyloid beta (Aβ) burden in AD and DLB.
METHODS: We included 420 participants (70 AD, 70 DLB, 280 CU) in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Gait was assessed using a pressure-sensor walkway. Aβ deposition was analyzed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission topography (PET).
RESULTS: The DLB group had reduced stride velocity, step length, and stride width variability, as well as increased double support percentage (%DS) and variability in step length, swing time, and step time compared to the AD and CU groups. Aβ burden was not associated with any gait outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This study provides additional evidence that gait differs between AD and DLB. Larger studies are needed to investigate associations between Aβ burden and gait outcomes in dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Gait was more impaired in dementia than in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. Compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) had more impaired pace, variability, and postural control. Step length and double support (%) distinguished DLB and AD with moderate accuracy.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39956946,Comparative analysis of Elecsys and ELISA for differentiating amyloid-PET status in a Korean memory clinic based on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.,"BackgroundThe adoption of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in clinical practice is expected to increase following recent approval of disease-modifying therapies. Fully automated immunoassays, Elecsys platform, offer convenience and enhanced reliability.ObjectiveThis study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Elecsys assay in a Korean clinical setting, comparing its effectiveness to ELISA for detecting amyloid-PET positivity.MethodsCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ<sub>42</sub>, pTau<sub>181</sub>, tTau, pTau<sub>181</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub>, and tTau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> were evaluated using Elecsys kits on a Cobas e 411 analyzer and manual Innotest ELISA with paired frozen samples (n = 118) from subjects with cognitive status ranging from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment and dementia.ResultsStrong linear correlations were observed between Elecsys- and ELISA-measured Aβ<sub>42</sub>, pTau<sub>181</sub>, and tTau levels. Receiver operating characteristic-based cutoff points for pTau<sub>181</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> (0.0252) and tTau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> (0.258) in Elecsys demonstrated the highest areas under the curve (0.97 and 0.96) and predictive values (96.6% for both) for detecting amyloid-PET abnormalities. No cases of abnormal amyloid PET status were found without concurrent abnormal CSF biomarkers when considering Elecsys Aβ<sub>42</sub> and the pTau<sub>181</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio simultaneously. In addition, previously established cutoffs for combined ratios effectively differentiated amyloid PET status in our samples.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated the utility of Elecsys-measured CSF AD biomarkers in agreement with amyloid-PET classification in the Korean population. The pTau<sub>181</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> and tTau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratios were the most accurate in detecting amyloid-PET (+), with Elecsys showing higher accuracy than ELISA. The study also supported the applicability of common cutoffs from Western countries for these biomarkers in our samples.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40168071,ABCB1 Gene Polymorphisms and Their Contribution to Cognitive Decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Next-Generation Sequencing Study.,"The ABCB1 gene, encoding the ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1, plays a crucial role in the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and the transport of cholesterol, implicating it in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene and cognitive decline in individuals with MCI, particularly focusing on language function. A longitudinal cohort study involving 1005 participants from the Czech Brain Aging Study was conducted. Participants included individuals with Alzheimer's disease, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), non-amnestic MCI, subjective cognitive decline, and healthy controls. Next-generation sequencing was utilized to analyze the entire ABCB1 gene. Cognitive performance was assessed using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Boston Naming Test and the semantic verbal fluency test. Ten ABCB1 polymorphisms (rs55912869, rs56243536, rs10225473, rs10274587, rs2235040, rs12720067, rs12334183, rs10260862, rs201620488, rs28718458) were significantly associated with cognitive performance, particularly in language decline among amnestic MCI patients. In silico analyses revealed that some of these polymorphisms may affect the binding sites for transcription factors (HNF-3alpha, C/EBPβ, GR-alpha) and the generation of novel exonic splicing enhancers. Additionally, polymorphism rs55912869 was identified as a potential binding site for the microRNA hsa-mir-3163. Our findings highlight the significant role of ABCB1 polymorphisms in cognitive decline, particularly in language function, among individuals with amnestic MCI. These polymorphisms may influence gene expression and function through interactions with miRNAs, transcription factors, and alternative splicing mechanisms.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,2025
40116674,Alzheimer-typical temporo-parietal atrophy and hypoperfusion are associated with a more significant cholinergic impairment in amnestic neurodegenerative syndromes.,"BackgroundTo date, cholinomimetics remain central in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, postmortem investigations indicate that the AD-typical progressive amnestic syndrome may also result from predominantly limbic non-AD neuropathology such as TDP-43 proteinopathy and argyrophilic grain disease. Experimental evidence links a beneficial response to cholinomimetics in early AD to reduced markers of cholinergic neurotransmission. However, the cholinergic impairment varies among patients with a clinical AD presentation, likely due to non-AD (co)-pathologies.ObjectiveThis study examines whether AD-typical atrophy and hypoperfusion can provide information about the cholinergic system in clinically diagnosed AD.MethodsThirty-two patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with the tracer N-methyl-4-piperidyl-acetate (MP4A) to estimate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, neurological examinations, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessment. The 'cholinergic deficit' was computed as the deviation of AChE activity from cognitively normal controls across the cerebral cortex and correlated gray matter (GM) and perfusion of temporo-parietal cortices typically affected by AD and basal forebrain (BF) GM.ResultsTemporo-parietal perfusion and GM, as well as the inferior temporal to medial temporal ratio of perfusion correlated negatively with the 'cholinergic deficit'. A smaller Ch4p area of the BF was associated with a more significant 'cholinergic deficit', albeit to a lesser degree than cortical measures.ConclusionsIn clinically diagnosed AD, temporo-parietal GM and perfusion are more closely associated with the 'cholinergic deficit' than BF volumes, making them possible markers for cholinergic treatment response in amnestic neurodegeneration.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40042495,Demographic and clinical characteristics of initial patients receiving amyloid-targeting treatments in the United States after regulatory approval.,"INTRODUCTION: Three treatments for Alzheimer's disease have been approved in the United States. Data are lacking on the characteristics of the initial treatment recipients.
METHODS: We identified treatment recipients in the full Medicare fee-for-service data for 2021 to 2023. We compared their age, sex, race/ethnicity, dual eligibility, comorbidities, and median household income and educational attainment in their residence's ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) to those of the overall Medicare population aged 65+.
RESULTS: Treated patients were more likely to be non-Hispanic White (89% vs 82%) and less likely to be dually eligible (1% vs 8.8%). Average median household income ($97,136 vs $84,449) and proportion of residents with at least a bachelor's degree (41% vs 31%) were higher in treated patients' ZCTAs.
DISCUSSION: The first patients receiving amyloid-targeting treatment represent a more privileged subset. While needing to be confirmed with more data, these results point to the need for efforts to make access more equitable.
HIGHLIGHTS: Little is known about the initial 924 patients receiving amyloid-targeting treatments in the United States from 2021 to 2023. They were more likely to be White and less likely to be dually eligible than the Medicare population. They resided in wealthier and more highly educated areas. Comorbidity burden was similar to that observed in clinical trials. Those initial results point to the need to improve equitable access to treatment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39823175,Estimated pulse wave velocity associated with cognitive phenotypes in a rural older population in China: A cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: To examine the longitudinal association between estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) and cognitive phenotypes in a rural Chinese older population.
METHODS: This population-based study included 1857 dementia-free participants (age ≥60 years) who were examined in 2014 and followed in 2018. ePWV was calculated using age and mean blood pressure (MBP). Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and neuropsychological tests. Dementia was diagnosed following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards models, linear regression models, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves.
RESULTS: Per 1-m/s increase in ePWV was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 1.51(1.30-1.75) for dementia and 1.58(1.33-1.89) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and with an MMSE score decline (adjusted β-coefficient = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.21). A nonlinear association was observed between baseline ePWV and follow-up cognitive scores.
DISCUSSION: A higher ePWV is associated with an increased risk of dementia, AD, accelerated cognitive decline, and poorer cognitive performance in older adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: An increased estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) was associated with incident dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and accelerated cognitive decline in a rural Chinese older population. A higher ePWV at baseline was associated with lower scores of global cognition and multiple cognitive domains at the 4-year follow-up. An increased ePWV may be a risk factor for dementia and accelerated cognitive deterioration in aging.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39851370,Cognitive Planning Improved After Cycling Exercise in Older Adults with Down Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cognitive functions are a crucial part of daily living, especially for adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have a high likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease in adulthood. In addition, adults with DS move slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to self-paced cycling.
METHODS: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC).
RESULTS: Our results showed that cognitive planning as measured by total correct score in the TOL showed improvement for both ACT and VC after 8 weeks of exercise, F(1, 22) = 6.22, p = 0.021. There were no significant differences for spatial memory or set switching.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that cycling exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function, especially problem solving in older adults with DS. Our results are discussed with respect to upregulation of neurotrophic factors that increase functioning in the prefrontal cortex that accompanies exercise and leads to improvements in cognitive planning which is essential to many activities of daily living and quality of life for older adults with DS.",Brain Sci,2024
39998958,The interaction between dysfunction of vasculature and tauopathy in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.,"Tauopathy is one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). At present, there have been many studies on the formation, deposition, and intercellular transmission of tau in neurons and immune cells. The vasculature is an important component of the central nervous system. This review discusses the interaction between vasculature and tau in detail from three aspects. (1) The vascular risk factors (VRFs) discussed in this review include diabetes mellitus (DM), abnormal blood pressure (BP), and hypercholesterolemia. (2) In ADRD pathology, the hyperphosphorylation and deposition of tau interact with disrupted vasculature, such as different cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscular cells, and pericytes), the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the cerebral lymphatic system. (3) The functions of vasculature are regulated by various signaling transductions. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide, calcium signaling, Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing Kinase, and receptors for advanced glycation end products are discussed in this review. Our findings indicate that the prevention and treatment of vascular health may be a potential target for ADRD combination therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: Persistent VRFs increase early disruption of vascular mechanisms and are strongly associated with tau pathology in ADRD. Cell dysfunction in the vasculature causes BBB leakage and drainage incapacity of the cerebral lymphatic system, which interacts with tau pathology. Signaling molecules in the vasculature regulate vasodilation and contraction, angiogenesis, and CBF. Abnormal signaling transduction is related to tau hyperphosphorylation and deposition.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40012679,TDP-43 as a potential retinal biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases.,"TDP-43 proteinopathies are a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) characterized by the pathological cytoplasmic aggregation of the TDP-43 protein. These include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and others. TDP-43 in the eye shows promise as a biomarker for these NDDs. Several studies have identified cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions in retinal layers of donors with ALS, FTLD, AD, CTE, and other conditions using immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that pathological aggregates of TDP-43 in the human retina are most prevalent in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and CTE, suggesting these diseases may provide the most reliable context for studying the potential of TDP-43 as a retinal biomarker. Animal model studies have been pivotal in exploring TDP-43's roles in the retina, including its nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, RNA binding properties, and interactions with other proteins. Despite these advances, more research is needed to develop therapeutic strategies. A major limitation of human autopsy studies is the lack of corresponding brain pathology assessments to confirm TDP-43 proteinopathy diagnosis and staging. Other limitations include small sample sizes, lack of antemortem eye pathology and clinical histories, and limited comparisons across multiple NDDs. Future directions for the TDP-43 as a retinal biomarker for NDDs include retinal tracers, hyperspectral imaging, oculomics, and machine learning development.",Front Neurosci,2025
39951189,Microglial NLRP3 Inflammasomes in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: From Interaction with Autophagy/Mitophagy to Therapeutics.,"The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, discovered 20 years ago, is crucial in controlling innate immune reactions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). By initiating the release of inflammatory molecules (including caspases, IL-1β, and IL-18), the excessively activated inflammasome complex in microglia leads to chronic inflammation and neuronal death, resulting in the progression of cognitive deficiencies. Even though the involvement of NLRP3 has been implicated in neuroinflammation and widely explored in several studies, there are plenty of controversies regarding its precise roles and activation mechanisms in AD. Another prominent feature of AD is impairment in microglial autophagy, which can be either the cause or the consequence of NLRP3 activation and contributes to the aggregation of misfolded proteins and aberrant chronic inflammatory state seen in the disease course. Studies also demonstrate that intracellular buildup of dysfunctional and damaged mitochondria due to defective mitophagy enhances inflammasome activation, further suggesting that restoration of impaired autophagy and mitophagy can effectively suppress it, thereby reducing inflammation and protecting microglia and neurons. This review is primarily focused on the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the etiopathology of AD, its interactions with microglial autophagy/mitophagy, and the latest developments in NLRP3 inflammasome-targeted therapeutic interventions being implicated for AD treatment.",Mol Neurobiol,2025

39732510,Plasma phosphorylated tau and neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but their neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood.
METHODS: NPSs and cognition were assessed annually in participants (DLB n = 222; Alzheimer's disease [AD] n = 125) from the European DLB (E-DLB) Consortium, and plasma phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181) and p-tau231 concentrations were measured at baseline.
RESULTS: Hallucinations, delusions, and depression were more common in DLB than in AD and, in a subgroup with longitudinal follow-up, persistent hallucinations and NPSs were associated with lower p-tau181 and p-tau231 in DLB. In adjusted linear mixed-effects models, hallucinations at baseline were associated with greater longitudinal cognitive impairment in DLB, with a significant interaction with p-tau231.
DISCUSSION: Higher p-tau181 and p-tau231 levels were associated with a lower longitudinal risk of NPSs and hallucinations in early-stage DLB. However, the interaction between hallucinations and p-tau231 suggests that when AD co-pathology and hallucinations do co-exist in DLB that they may synergistically exacerbate cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) were more common in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower plasma phosphorylated tau-231 (p-tau231) and p-tau181 levels were associated with persistent hallucinations in DLB. Lower plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181 levels were associated with an increased risk of persistent NPSs in early DLB. Hallucinations at baseline were associated with greater cognitive dysfunction in DLB, and there was an interaction with p-tau231.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39967807,Benign regulation of short-chain fatty acids: the underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of manual acupuncture on cognitive ability and the intestinal mucosal barrier in APP/PS1 mice.,"BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely related to the occurrence and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier caused by a decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) plays a key role in gut microbiota dysbiosis-induced neuroinflammation in AD. Our previous research confirmed for the first time that manual acupuncture (MA) can benignly modulate gut microbiota dysbiosis, alleviating the destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier. However, the regulatory effect of MA on SCFAs remains elusive, and the underlying mechanism by which MA improves intestinal mucosal barrier function requires elucidation.
METHODS: In the APP/PS1 manual acupuncture (Am) group, MA was applied at Baihui (GV20), Yintang (GV29), and Zusanli (ST36). Probiotics were delivered to the APP/PS1 probiotic (Ap) group. Alterations in spatial learning and memory, intestinal barrier function, SCFAs in feces and serum, the expression of FFAR3 and NF-κB, and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in each group.
RESULTS: Compared with those in the C57BL/6 control (Cc) group, cognitive ability was significantly decreased, SCFAs and FFAR3 expression were obviously decreased, intestinal barrier integrity was drastically impaired, and the expression of NF-κB and the levels of intestinal IL-1β and TNF-α were increased in the APP/PS1 control (Ac) group. These changes were reversed by MA and probiotics.
CONCLUSION: MA can significantly reduce intestinal inflammation and alleviate destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier in APP/PS1 mice. SCFAs/FFAR3/NF-κB may be important targets through which MA benignly regulates intestinal mucosal barrier function.",Front Neurosci,2025
39968692,Dissociable spatial topography of cortical atrophy in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: A head-to-head comparison of the LEADS and ADNI cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: Early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD, respectively) have distinct clinical manifestations, with prior work based on small samples suggesting unique patterns of neurodegeneration. The current study performed a head-to-head comparison of cortical atrophy in EOAD and LOAD, using two large and well-characterized cohorts (LEADS and ADNI).
METHODS: We analyzed brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired from 377 sporadic EOAD patients and 317 sporadicLOAD patients who were amyloid positive and had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia (i.e., early-stage AD), along with cognitively unimpaired participants.
RESULTS: After controlling for the level of cognitive impairment, we found a double dissociation between AD clinical phenotype and localization/magnitude of atrophy, characterized by predominant neocortical involvement in EOAD and more focal anterior medial temporal involvement in LOAD.
DISCUSSION: Our findings point to the clinical utility of MRI-based biomarkers of atrophy in differentiating between EOAD and LOAD, which may be useful for diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) patients showed distinct and overlapping cortical atrophy patterns. EOAD patients showed prominent atrophy in widespread neocortical regions. LOAD patients showed prominent atrophy in the anterior medial temporal lobe. Regional atrophy was correlated with the severity of global cognitive impairment. Results were comparable when the sample was stratified for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39760808,From Genes to Metabolites: HSP90B1's Role in Alzheimer's Disease and Potential for Therapeutic Intervention.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder, predominantly affecting individuals in the presenile and elderly populations, with an etiology that remains elusive. This investigation aimed to elucidate the alterations in anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in the AD brain, thereby expanding the repertoire of biomarkers for the disease. Using publically available gene expression data for the hippocampus from both healthy and AD subjects, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Subsequent intersection with a comprehensive list of 575 ARGs yielded a subset for enrichment analysis. Machine learning algorithms were employed to identify potential biomarker, which was validated in an AD animal model. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis was conducted on the biomarker and its interacting genes and microRNAs were predicted through online databases. To assess its biological functions, the expression of the marker was suppressed in an in vitro model to examine cell viability and inflammation-related indicators. Furthermore, following treatment with the inhibitor, the dysregulated metabolites in the hippocampus of the model mice were evaluated. Forty-seven ARGs were ultimately identified, with HSP90B1 emerging as a central marker. HSP90B1 was found to be significantly up-regulated in AD hippocampal samples and its inhibition conferred increased cell viability and reduced levels of inflammatory factors in amyloid β-protein (Aβ)-treated cells. A total of 24 differentially expressed metabolites were confidently identified between model mice and those with low HSP90B1 expression, with bioinformatics analysis shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of HSP90B1's involvement in AD. Collectively, these findings may inform novel insights into the pathogenesis, mechanisms, or therapeutic strategies for AD.",Neuromolecular Med,2025
40183825,Seeding-competent early tau multimers are associated with cell type-specific transcriptional signatures.,"The initial molecular alterations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unknown. Established AD is characterized by profound structural and transcriptional alterations in the human brain, with the hallmark neuropathological features being beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in senile plaques and hyperphosphorylated fibrillar tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Previous evidence indicates that tau multimerization into small aggregates is one of the earliest molecular alterations, anticipating the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in NFTs. In this study, we investigated the seeding capacity of these early small tau multimers and the transcriptional changes associated with them, aiming to unveil early pathogenic processes in AD-type tau pathology. Early tau multimers visualized with tau proximity ligation assay (tau-PLA) in the post-mortem temporal cortex demonstrated high seeding activity detected by real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay and induction of aggregates in a tau biosensor cell line. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, we showed that brain tissue harboring seeding-competent early tau multimers, but without significant NFT pathology, is associated with substantial gene expression alterations across diverse cell types when compared to control tissue lacking either multimers or NFTs. Differentially expressed genes, such as APP, MAPT, and PSEN1, exhibited significant enrichment of AD heritability in up-regulated genes within excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Pseudotime analysis exposed a positive correlation between the progression of tau pathology and the expression of genes marking reactive astrocytes. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that seeding-competent tau multimerization may initiate AD-type tau pathology cascades before the accumulation of tau in NFTs. This research contributes valuable insights into the early molecular events associated with AD, with implications for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Acta Neuropathol,2025
40033775,Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging analysis of early mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) represents a prodromal stage of dementia, and early detection is crucial for delaying dementia progression. However, accurately identifying its neuroimaging features remains challenging.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate structural and functional neuroimaging changes in EMCI using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.
METHODS: One hundred and eleven participants were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): 36 with cognitively normal (CN), 30 with EMCI, 32 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 13 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). FreeSurfer software was employed to segment hippocampal and amygdala subregions. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity were processed using Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging toolbox. Graph Theoretical Network Analysis toolbox was utilized to evaluate global functional network.
RESULTS: The volume of most hippocampal and amygdala subregions was decreased in AD group than those of EMCI group in structural MRI. Significant differences were found between EMCI and AD group in fALFF (right insula) and ReHo (bilateral caudate regions). EMCI group exhibited stronger functional connectivity between left hippocampus and right inferior temporal gyrus (compared to CN), left inferior temporal gyrus (compared to LMCI), and cerebellum crus 8 (compared to AD). EMCI group exhibited stronger connectivity between right hippocampus and left anterior cingulate gyrus compared to AD. Network metrics showed no significant differences among these groups, but all exhibited small-world properties.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal MRI analysis revealed the neuroimaging characteristics of EMCI and promoted the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuroimaging changes in EMCI.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39975919,Crystallized and fluid cognitive abilities have different genetic associations with neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Cognitive function is associated with risk for multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous research on the genetic relations between cognition and psychopathology has largely treated cognitive function as unitary, in part due to a lack of well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on specific domains, particularly crystallized knowledge (Gc). Important domains within the hierarchy of cognitive function, especially Gc, have been underexplored regarding their associations with psychiatric disorders. Here, we parse the genetics of cognitive test performance into components representing reaction time, fluid reasoning, and crystallized knowledge. This multivariate approach that allows us to report results from a GWAS meta-analysis of crystallized knowledge (N ~ 438,000). We then test how multiple neuropsychiatric disorders with established links to cognitive function (Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Alzheimer's Disease) are genetically related to these three cognitive domains, and to a noncognitive factor associated with educational attainment (NonCog). We document specific and heterogenous patterns of genetic associations between each neuropsychiatric disorder and the different domains of cognitive function and the noncognitive factor. Previous reports of genetic sharing between neuropsychiatric disorders and GWAS of aggregate cognitive function or educational attainment have failed identify these substantial differences in which cognitive functions drive these relations for which disorders.",Res Sq,2025
40018518,Non-pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease: an update.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs memory, cognitive function, and the ability to perform daily tasks. The pathological features of AD include β-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Current AD treatments target pathological changes but often fail to noticeably slow disease progression and can cause severe complications, limiting their effectiveness. In addition to therapies targeting the core pathology of AD, a more comprehensive approach may be needed for its treatment. In recent years, non-pharmacological treatments such as physical therapy, exercise therapy, cell therapy, and nanoparticles have shown great potential in mitigating disease progression and alleviating clinical symptoms.

Previous studies have been limited by a large majority of participants with severe dementia or advanced stages of pathologies, which limits the detectability of cognitive effects from vascular neuropathologies.
METHODS: Using neuropathology data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we examined the association of vascular neuropathologies with cognitive scores in participants without severe dementia (N = 1526) using multivariable linear regression.
RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, education, LBD, and ADNC, arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower memory (β = -0.16 ± 0.06, p < 0.001), executive function (β = -0.25 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), and language scores (β = -0.20 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The effects of arteriolosclerosis remained when controlling for vascular risk factors.
DISCUSSION: Vascular neuropathologies exhibit distinct relationships with cognition. Arteriolosclerosis is an independent contributor to cognition. Further research should be conducted on whether arteriolosclerosis can serve as a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in early disease stages.
HIGHLIGHTS: In individuals who do not have severe dementia, vascular neuropathologies are common, and the combination of pathologies is heterogeneous in a convenience sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center that reported all the neuropathology data elements for this investigation. Arteriolosclerosis is associated with several cognitive domain scores, including memory, executive function, and language when controlling for the effects of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change and Lewy body disease. These results reinforce the importance of vascular pathology for cognition among people along the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40057579,Network pharmacology and metabolomics analysis of Tinospora cordifolia reveals BACE1 and MAOB as potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease.,"Tinospora cordifolia has been used for thousands of years to treat various health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of action and protein targets of T. cordifolia in the context of Alzheimer's disease through untargeted metabolomics and network pharmacology. LC-MS/MS analysis resulted in 1186 metabolites, including known bioactive compounds such as liquiritin, Plastoquinone 3, and Shoyuflavone A, to name a few. The network pharmacology analysis highlighted the metabolite-protein interaction with the enrichment of 591 human proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors and other regulatory proteins. Pathway analysis highlighted the enrichment of cAMP, mTOR, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways along with cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic synapse, and apoptosis. The docking results suggest that T. cordifolia metabolites could interact with key Alzheimer's disease targets BACE1 and MAO-B, suggesting its role in neuroprotection. These findings provide insights into the biochemical pathways underlying T. cordifolia's therapeutic effects and provides a foundation for future exploration of T. cordifolia in the context of translational research.",Sci Rep,2025
39777850,Mapping amyloid beta predictors of entorhinal tau in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the entorhinal regions are key Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers, but the spatial Aβ pathways influencing tau pathology remain unclear.
METHODS: We applied predictive modeling to identify Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) spatial patterns that predict entorhinal tau levels, future hippocampal volume, and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) scores at 5-year follow-up. The model was trained on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 237), incorporating amyloid-PET (positron emission tomography), tau-PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive data, and validated on Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) (N = 276).
RESULTS: The model accurately predicted entorhinal tau levels (r = 0.48, p < 0.0001), future hippocampal volume (r = 0.24, p = 0.002), and PACC scores (r = 0.35, p < 0.0001) based on regional Aβ.
DISCUSSION: Aβ in the rostral middle frontal, medial orbitofrontal, and striatal regions predict entorhinal tau levels, future hippocampal volume, and PACC scores, indicating their potential as early biomarkers in AD prediction models.
HIGHLIGHTS: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging reveals amyloid beta (Aβ) patterns predicting entorhinal tau levels in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ in medial orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and nucleus accumbens best predicts tau. Aβ distribution in these regions predicts future hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Model validated with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) data sets, showing robustness and reproducibility. Findings suggest early Aβ patterns can aid in diagnosing AD and guide anti-Aβ therapies.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40175501,"Microglial TLR4-Lyn kinase is a critical regulator of neuroinflammation, Aβ phagocytosis, neuronal damage, and cell survival in Alzheimer's disease.","Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) are a focus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research due to their central involvement in the response to amyloid-beta plaques. Microglial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is instrumental in the binding of fibrillary amyloid proteins, while Lyn kinase (Lyn) is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in immune signaling. Lyn is a novel, non-canonical, intracellular adaptor with diverse roles in cell-specific signaling which directly binds to TLR4 to modify its function. Lyn can be activated in response to TLR4 stimulation, leading to phosphorylation of various substrates and modulation of inflammatory and phagocytosis signaling pathways. Here, we investigated the TLR4-Lyn interaction in neuroinflammation using WT, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD x Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> mouse models by western blotting (WB), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometric (FC) analysis. A spatial transcriptomic analysis of microglia in WT, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD x Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed essential genes involved in neuroinflammation, Aβ phagocytosis, and neuronal damage. Finally, we explored the effects of a synthetic, TLR4-Lyn modulator protein (TLIM) through an in vitro AD model using primary murine microglia. Our WB, co-IP, IHC, and FC data show an increased, novel, direct protein-protein interaction between TLR4 and Lyn kinase in the brains of 5XFAD mice compared to WT. Furthermore, in the absence of Lyn (5XFAD x Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> mice); increased expression of protective Syk kinase was observed, enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis, increased astrocyte activity, decreased neuronal dystrophy, and a further increase in the cell survival signaling and protective DAM population was noted. The DAM population in 5XFAD mice which produce more inflammatory cytokines and phagocytose more Aβ were observed to express greater levels of TLR4 and Lyn. Pathway analysis comparison between WT, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD x Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> mice supported these findings via our microglial spatial transcriptomic analysis. Finally, we created an in vitro co-culture system with primary murine microglial and primary murine hippocampal cells exposed to Aβ as a model of AD. When these co-cultures were treated with our TLR4-Lyn Interaction Modulators (TLIMs), an increase in Aβ phagocytosis and a decrease in neuronal dystrophy was seen. Lyn kinase has a central role in modulating TLR4-induced inflammation and Syk-induced protection in a 5XFAD mouse model. Our TLIMs ameliorate AD sequalae in an in vitro model of AD and could be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat AD.",Sci Rep,2025
40177250,Global trends and prospects of ocular biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis necessitates the development of novel biomarkers that ensure high diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness in blood tests. Recent studies have identified a significant association between ocular symptoms and the pathological processes of AD, suggesting the potential for effective ocular biomarkers. This bibliometric analysis aims to explore recent advancements and research trends in ocular biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.
METHODS: Articles related to AD and ocular biomarkers were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. These articles were analyzed using bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer, R-bibliometrix, and CiteSpace.
RESULTS: A total of 623 papers were included in the analysis, revealing a steady increase in publications since 2012. The United States produced the most publications, followed by China and Italy. Notably, authors affiliated with Complutense University of Madrid in Spain and Sapienza University of Rome in Italy made significant contributions, demonstrating robust internal collaborations. The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease published the most articles pertaining to ocular science and neuroscience. Keyword analysis indicates evolving trends in ocular markers for AD from 2005 to 2024, transitioning from diagnostic techniques (e.g., ""spectroscopy,"" ""cerebrospinal fluid"") to pathological mechanisms (e.g., ""oxidative stress"") and advanced imaging technologies (e.g., ""optical coherence tomography angiography"").
CONCLUSION: The bibliometric analysis highlights key research hotspots related to ocular markers for AD, documenting the shift from basic diagnostic techniques to advanced imaging methods and the discovery of novel biomarkers. Future research may investigate the potential of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography, tear component analysis, eye movement assessments, and artificial intelligence to enhance early detection of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39956951,Association of hippocampal atrophy with tau pathology of temporal regions in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundHippocampal atrophy is linked to memory and cognitive deficits, preceding clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by decades. Morphometry changes in the hippocampal formation (HF) and their relationship to tau deposition in non-demented individuals remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate morphometry changes in the HF and their association with tau deposition in a non-demented cohort.MethodsEighty-three subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent T1-weighted MRI and Tau-PET scans at baseline and longitudinal follow-up. Participants were divided into amyloid-negative (Aβ-) and amyloid-positive (Aβ+) groups. Hippocampal volume/thickness were measured, and associations with tau deposition in temporal regions were examined using multivariable linear regression.ResultsNo significant association was found between the hippocampal volume/thickness and tau deposition of temporal regions for the Aβ- group. For the Aβ+ group, the hippocampal thickness was significantly associated with tau deposition of entorhinal cortex (ERC) for both hemispheres, and temporal pole, inferior temporal, and middle temporal regions for right hippocampi with the longitudinal follow up scans, while no significant association with the baseline scans. It was interesting that there was strong association between the baseline tau deposition of ERC and temporal pole and the longitudinal follow up thickness of left hippocampi, while the associated regions for the right hemisphere were ERC, temporal pole, and inferior temporal regions.ConclusionsHippocampal atrophy may precede cognitive symptoms, with tau deposition in adjacent temporal regions contributing to hippocampal changes. The right HF appears more vulnerable than the left, indicating hemispheric differences in pathology.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39789647,Biophysical mapping of TREM2-ligand interactions reveals shared surfaces for engagement of multiple Alzheimer's disease ligands.,"TREM2 is a signaling receptor expressed on microglia that has emerged as an important drug target for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. While a number of TREM2 ligands have been identified, little is known regarding the structural details of how they engage. To better understand this, we created a protein library of 28 different TREM2 variants that could be used to map interactions with various ligands using biolayer interferometry. The variants are located in previously identified putative binding surfaces on TREM2 called the hydrophobic site, basic site, and site 2. We found that mutations to the hydrophobic site ablated binding to apoE4 and TDP-43. Competition binding experiments indicated that apoE4 and oAβ42 share overlapping binding sites on TREM2. In contrast, binding to C1q was disrupted most strongly by mutations to the basic site, including R46, with some mutations to the hydrophobic site also attenuating binding, thus suggesting a broader mediation of binding across the two sites. Supporting this, competition experiments indicated that C1q binding could be blocked by both apoE and oAβ42. TREM2 binding to IL-34 was mediated by the basic site at a surface centering on R76. Competition binding experiments validated the unique site for IL-34, showing little to no competition with either oAβ42 or apoE4. However, competition experiments between C1q and IL34 suggest that the ligands compete for binding at the basic site. Altogether, our results suggest that TREM2 utilizes the hydrophobic site (consisting of CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) as a common site to engage multiple ligands, and uses distinct basic sites to engage others. Our findings imply that pharmaceutical strategies targeting these surfaces might be effective to modulate TREM2 functions.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40079781,Vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: Exploring the potential of aerobic and resistance exercises as therapeutic strategies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, as a result of cognitive decline and neurological dysfunction. In AD, reduced cerebral blood flow and impaired vascularization result from capillary bed degeneration and decreased angiogenesis, as observed in both patients and animal models. Physical exercise is recognized as a potential intervention to delay AD progression and reduce disease risk. While most studies have focused on the benefits of aerobic exercise (AE), emerging evidence suggests that resistance exercise (RE) also exerts positive effects on overall health and cognitive function in aging and AD. However, a notable gap in knowledge remains regarding the effects of RE on cerebral blood flow and vascular structure. This review explores the processes by which AE and RE influence brain vascularization in aging and AD, including blood flow, endothelial function, angiogenesis and neurotrophic factor levels. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, we conclude that both AE and RE contribute to improved cerebral blood flow and vascular function, promoting vascular repair in the aging and AD-affected brain. By examining the relationship between exercise modalities and brain vascularization, this review expands knowledge regarding the processes underlying the neuroprotective effects of exercise in neurodegenerative and aging conditions.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39841851,Functional classification of tauopathy strains reveals the role of protofilament core residues.,"Distinct tau amyloid assemblies underlie diverse tauopathies but defy rapid classification. Cell and animal experiments indicate tau functions as a prion, as different strains propagated in cells cause unique, transmissible neuropathology after inoculation. Strain amplification requires compatibility of the monomer and amyloid template. We used cryo-electron microscopy to study one cell-based yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged strain, resolving its amyloid nature. We then used sequential alanine (Ala) substitution (scan) within tau repeat domain (RD) to measure incorporation to preexisting tau RD-YFP aggregates. This robustly discriminated strains, defining sequences critical for monomer incorporation. We then created 3R/4R or 4R wild-type RD (amino acids 246 to 408) biosensors. Ala scan of recombinant tau seeds with the Alzheimer's disease (AD) fold matched that of AD homogenate. We scanned 22 brain lysates comprising four tauopathies. This clustered cases by neuropathological syndrome, revealed the role of amino acids in protofilament folds, and allowed strain discrimination based on amino acid requirements for prion replication.",Sci Adv,2025
40166037,Large-scale Plasma Proteomic Profiling Unveils Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers and Pathways for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Proteomic studies have been instrumental in identifying AD-related proteins present in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. This study comprehensively examined 6,905 plasma proteins in more than 3,300 well-characterized individuals to identify new proteins, pathways, and predictive model for AD. With three-stage analysis (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis) we identified 416 proteins (294 novel) associated with clinical AD status and the findings were further validated in two external datasets including more than 7,000 samples and seven previous studies. Pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in endothelial and blood hemostatic (ACHE, SMOC1, SMOC2, VEGFA, VEGFB, SPARC), capturing blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to disease. Other pathways were capturing known processes implicated in AD, such as lipid dysregulation (APOE, BIN1, CLU, SMPD1, PLA2G12A, CTSF) or immune response (C5, CFB, DEFA5, FBXL4), which includes proteins known to be part of the causal pathway indicating that some of the identified proteins and pathways are involved in disease pathogenesis. An enrichment of brain and neural pathways (axonal guidance signaling or myelination signaling) indicates that, in fact, blood proteomics capture brain- and disease-related changes, which can lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and predictive models. Machine learning model was employed to identify a set of seven proteins that were highly predictive of both clinical AD (AUC > 0.72) and biomarker-defined AD status (AUC > 0.88), that were replicated in multiple external cohorts as well as with orthogonal platforms. These extensive findings underscore the potential of using plasma proteins as biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of AD, as well as potentially guiding treatment decisions.",Res Sq,2025
40018325,Association between BrainAGE and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"INTRODUCTION: The brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) method uses a machine learning model to generate an age estimate from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal was to study the association of brain age with Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging and plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-three individuals from the Indiana Memory and Aging Study underwent structural MRI, amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma sampling. The MRI scans were processed using the software program BrainAgeR to receive a ""brain age"" estimate. Plasma biomarker concentrations were measured, and partial Pearson correlation models were used to evaluate their relationship with brain age gap (BAG) estimation (BrainAGE = chronological age - MRI estimated brain age).
RESULTS: Significant associations between BAG and amyloid and tau levels on PET and in plasma were observed depending on diagnostic categories.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that BAG is potentially a biomarker of pathology in AD which can be applied to routine brain imaging.
HIGHLIGHTS: Novel research that uses an artificial intelligence learning tool to estimate brain age.Findings suggest that brain age gap is associated with plasma and positron emission tomography Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.Differential relationships are seen in different stages of disease (preclinical vs. clinical).Results could play a role in early AD diagnosis and treatment.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40012995,Exploring the association between BIN1 gene polymorphisms and hippocampal subfield volume in community mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), crucial for early diagnosis. BIN1, a key AD susceptibility gene after APOE, has higher brain expression in AD and interacts with tau, affecting its pathology. Specific BIN1 SNPs are linked to AD and MCI, but mechanisms are unclear. This study will explore how BIN1 polymorphisms might influence MCI development and correlate with hippocampal integrity in MCI patients using MRI.
METHODS: This study enrolled a total of 52 elderly individuals with MCI and 55 cognitively CN individuals from five communities in Zhongshan Torch Development Zone. Blood samples were collected for analysis of BIN1 rs10200967, rs1060743, and rs4663093 gene polymorphisms, and MRI scans were conducted to assess the volume of hippocampal subregions. The study also seeks to examine the distribution of BIN1 genotypes in both MCI and healthy control populations, as well as to investigate the potential association between BIN1 rs10200967, rs1060743, and rs4663093 genotypes and hippocampal subregion structure in individuals with MCI.
RESULTS: Significant structural atrophy was observed in multiple hippocampal subregions, including left cornu ammonis (lCA), left dentate gyrus (lDG), left hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (lHATA), left subiculum (lSubc), right ornu ammonis (rCA), right dentate gyrus (rDG), right subiculum (rSubc), left entire hippocampus complex (lHIP), and right entire hippocampus complex (rHIP) in seniors with MCI compared to those in the CN (p &lt; 0.05), after adjusting for age, gender, education level, and APOEε4 status. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in left entorhinal cortex (lEC), right entorhinal cortex (rEC), right hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (rHATA), and total intracranial volume (TIV) (p &gt; 0.05). Notably, there were no significant differences in the distribution of BIN1 rs10200967, rs1060743, and rs4663093 genotypes among elderly individuals (p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the association between the BIN1 rs10200967 genotype and lHATA atrophy significant in the MCI after adjusting for age, gender, education level, APOEε4 status, and TIV (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study presents novel findings indicating an association between the BIN1 rs10200967 genotype and lHATA atrophy, with the rs10200967 CC genotype showing a higher volume of lHATA in individuals with MCI. These results suggest that the rs10200967 CC genotype may confer a protective effect against MCI, offering a potential basis for early detection and prevention of AD.",Front Neurol,2025
40148430,Construction and evaluation of a diagnostic model for Alzheimer's disease based on mitophagy-related genes.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Mitophagy fulfills crucial functions in neurodegenerative disorders and neuronal survival but the relationship between mitophagy and AD is unclear. Mitophagy correlation scores between AD samples and control samples were calculated using single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) based on two datasets from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Mitophagy-related genes (MRGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD screened by WGCNA and ""limma"" package were intersected to take common genes. These overlapping genes were further compressed and used for diagnostic modeling by adopting the recursive feature elimination (RFE) and LASSO analysis. The reliability of the diagnostic model was verified based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Then, a transcription factor (TF)-mRNA regulatory network of these key genes was established. Lastly, ssGSEA was employed to examine the relationship between the identified genes and cellular pathways and immune cell infiltration. AD samples had notably lower mitophagy correlation scores than control samples. A total of 12 MRGs in the module with the greatest mitophagy connection with AD patients were identified. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in synaptic function-related pathways. Based on GSE122063, a diagnostic prediction model was created and validated using two mitophagy-related genes (YWHAZ and NDE1), showing an area under ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.7. This confirmed that the diagnostic model had a high predictive value. The TF-mRNA network showed that four TFs, namely, FOXC1, FOXL1, HOXA5 and GATA2, were regulated by both YWHAZ and NDE1 genes. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that NDE1 promoted the infiltration of most immune cells, while YWHAZ mainly inhibited the infiltration of most immune cells. The current findings improved our understanding of mitophagy in AD, contributing to future research and treatment development in AD.",Sci Rep,2025
40134691,Efficacy of Ginkgo biloba as an adjunct to donepezil in amyloid PET-positive Alzheimer's patients.,"BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba is widely used in some regions as an adjunct therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its potential mechanisms include antioxidative and anti-amyloid properties, yet clinical evidence remains mixed.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether combining Ginkgo with donepezil confers additional benefits in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. We also explored changes in the plasma biomarker MDS-Oaβ (Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Aβ), which reflects the propensity of Aβ monomers to form oligomers.
METHODS: This retrospective study included newly diagnosed, drug-naïve AD patients who were amyloid PET-positive and had at least 12 months of follow-up. Participants received either donepezil alone (Donepezil-only) or donepezil plus Ginkgo (Donepezil-Ginkgo). Clinical measures included the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and the Sum of Boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB). Plasma MDS-Oaβ was assessed at baseline and at 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed (60 Donepezil-only, 41 Donepezil-Ginkgo). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar. After 12 months, the Donepezil-only group showed minimal change in K-MMSE and a slight decrease in MDS-Oaβ. The Donepezil-Ginkgo group demonstrated a significant improvement in K-MMSE (+2.4) and a larger reduction in MDS-Oaβ (-0.15). No significant between-group difference was observed for CDR-SB. Adverse events were mostly mild and did not lead to discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: The addition of Ginkgo to donepezil may yield superior cognitive outcomes and a greater decrease in plasma MDS-Oaβ compared with donepezil alone in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. Further large-scale, prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate Ginkgo's mechanistic role in AD.",Front Neurol,2025
39713939,"The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments.","US clinical practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or AD and related dementias (ADRD) are decades old and aimed at specialists. This evidence-based guideline was developed to empower all-including primary care-clinicians to implement a structured approach for evaluating a patient with symptoms that may represent clinical AD/ADRD. As part of the modified Delphi approach and guideline development process (7374 publications were reviewed; 133 met inclusion criteria) an expert workgroup developed recommendations as steps in a patient-centered evaluation process. The workgroup provided a summary of validated instruments to measure symptoms in daily life (including cognition, mood and behavior, and daily function) and to test for signs of cognitive impairment in the office. This article distills this information to provide a resource to support clinicians in the implementation of this approach in clinical practice. The companion articles provide context for primary care and specialty clinicians with regard to how to fit these instruments into the workflow and actions to take when integration of performance on these instruments with clinical profile and clinician judgment support potential cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39812719,Association of IL6 Gene Polymorphisms and Neurological Disorders: Insights from Integrated Bioinformatics and Meta-Analysis.,"Interleukin 6 (IL6) is an inflammatory biomarker linked to central and peripheral nervous system diseases. This study combined bioinformatics and statistical meta-analysis to explore potential associations between IL6 gene variants (rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797) and neurological disorders (NDs) and brain cancer. The meta-analysis was conducted on substantial case-control datasets and revealed a significant correlation between IL6 SNPs (rs1800795 and rs1800796) with overall NDs (p-value < 0.05). The disease-stratified analysis of rs1800795 revealed significant correlations with Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases (p-value < 0.05), while rs1800796 showed a substantial connection with Celiac disease (p-value < 0.05). The ethnicity-stratified analysis revealed noteworthy associations between rs1800795 in both Asians and Caucasians (p-value < 0.05), while rs1800796 showed significant associations across all ethnic groups analyzed (p-value < 0.05). Furthermore, integrated Bioinformatics analyses using GTEx and TCGA datasets highlighted IL6's involvement in NDs and its potential role in brain cancer. Specifically, IL6 SNPs (rs1800795 and rs1800797) showed a significant association with Glioma (p-value < 0.001). Copy number alterations and increased IL6 expressions were linked to cancer severity (p-value < 0.001) and hypoxia (p-value < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that elevated IL6 expression was strongly associated with decreased overall survival in brain cancer patients (p-value < 0.0001). In conclusion, this study identified notable correlations between IL6 SNPs and NDs, underscoring their potential as valuable prognostic biomarkers for various neurological conditions.",Neuromolecular Med,2025
40138942,BOLD amplitude correlates of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical stage during which molecular markers of amyloid beta and tau pathology rise, but there is minimal neurodegeneration or cognitive decline. Previous literature suggests that measures of brain function might be more sensitive to neuropathologic burden during the preclinical stage of AD than conventional measures of macrostructure, such as cortical thickness. Among studies that used resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions with Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast, most employed connectivity-based analytic approaches. Consequently, little is known about the effects of amyloid and tau pathology on amplitude of intrinsic BOLD signal fluctuations. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the effects of preclinical and prodromal AD on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the BOLD signal both at the whole-brain level and at a more granular level focused on subregions of the medial temporal lobe. We observed reduced ALFF in both preclinical and prodromal AD. In preclinical AD, amyloid positivity was associated with a spatially diffuse ALFF reduction in the frontal, medial parietal, and lateral temporal association cortices. In contrast, tau pathology was negatively associated with ALFF in the entorhinal cortex. These ALFF effects were observed in the absence of observable macrostructural changes in preclinical AD and remained after adjusting for structural atrophy in prodromal AD, indicating that ALFF offers additional sensitivity to early disease processes beyond what is provided by traditional structural imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. We conclude that ALFF may be a promising imaging-based biomarker in preclinical AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39841661,Reduction of Cystatin B results in increased cathepsin B activity in disomic but not Trisomy 21 human cellular and mouse models.,"Down syndrome, resulting from trisomy of human chromosome 21, is a common form of chromosomal disorder that results in intellectual disability and altered risk of several medical conditions. Individuals with Down syndrome have a greatly increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (DSAD), due to the presence of the APP gene on chromosome 21 that encodes the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). APP can be processed to generate amyloid-β, which accumulates in plaques in the brains of people who have Alzheimer's disease and is the upstream trigger of disease. Cathepsin B has potential roles in both APP processing and amyloid-β degradation and has been suggested to contribute to amyloid-β accumulation. An endogenous inhibitor of Cathepsin B, Cystatin B (CSTB), is encoded on chromosome 21. The abundance of this protein is increased in the brains of individuals with DSAD, which may be associated with a decrease in Cathepsin B activity compared to individuals who have Alzheimer's disease in the general population. Whether targeting CSTB can modulate Cathepsin B activity in the context of trisomy of chromosome 21 is unclear. Here we test if reducing CSTB can alter Cathepsin B activity in a mouse and a cellular model of trisomy of chromosome 21. We find that reducing CSTB abundance increases Cathepsin B activity in disomic controls but not in the presence of trisomy of chromosome 21. These findings offer new insights into the role of CSTB in regulating Cathepsin B activity.",PLoS One,2025
40085352,From Clinic to Mechanisms: Multi-Omics Provide New Insights into Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolites and the Spectrum of Psychiatric Disorders.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial in maintaining brain homeostasis by facilitating waste clearance, nutrient transport, and immune signaling. However, the links between CSF metabolites and psychiatric disorders, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain largely unexamined. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate potential causal relationships between CSF metabolites and 12 psychiatric disorders. Summary data for psychiatric disorders were sourced from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, while information on CSF metabolites was derived from two studies within the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease cohort. Causal estimates and pleiotropy were assessed using several robust methods, including inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis, weighted median analysis, MR-Egger regression, and the MR-Egger test. Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study was conducted to explore potential mechanisms and shared etiologies between CSF metabolites and psychiatric disorders. The genetic risk of eating disorders (ED) can be increased by leucine (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.21-1.97, P = 4.35 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), salicylate (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, P = 4.95 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), and 1-methylnicotinamide (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.09, P = 6.94 × 10⁻<sup>6</sup>), while methylmalonate may reduce ED risk (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 1.31 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>). Similarly, the risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) may be reduced by threonate (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.97, P = 1.98 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), oxalate (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.97, P = 3.15 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), phenyllactate (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98, P = 2.23 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), N-acetylglucosamine (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, P = 3.57 × 10⁻<sup>5</sup>), and citramalate (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99, P = 5.78 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>). Conversely, SCZ may upregulate gamma-glutamylleucine (β = 0.08, P = 1.97 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>) and O-sulfo-L-tyrosine (β = 0.06, P = 1.25 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), while downregulating gamma-glutamylphenylalanine (β = - 0.50, P = 1.16 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>). Signal pathways related to the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR), post-translational protein modifications, and immune regulation may mediate the causal relationship of CSF metabolites on ED and SCZ. We identified a casual genetic causal relationship between CSF metabolites and both ED and schizophrenia SCZ, which is potentially mediated by pathways related to energy metabolism, post-translational modifications, and immune regulation.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39716790,Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of 8-Prenyldaidzein: A Comprehensive Study of its Multi-Target Efficacy in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cognitive decline, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cholinergic loss. Due to the limited success of amyloid-targeted therapies, attention has shifted to new non-amyloid targets like phosphodiesterases (PDE). This study investigates the potential of Flemingia vestita (FV) phytomolecules and derivatives, particularly 8-Prenyldaidzein, in AD treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytocompounds and derivatives were screened for drug-likeness, toxicity, BBB permeability, and ADME profiles. Molecular docking was conducted with PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the best binding complexes.
RESULTS: 8-Prenyldaidzein, a derivative of daidzein, demonstrated favorable drug-likeness and ADME properties. It exhibited strong binding to PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE, with MD simulations confirming stable protein-ligand interactions.
DISCUSSION: The multi-target potential of 8-Prenyldaidzein, particularly through non-amyloid pathways, offers a promising approach to AD therapy. Its inhibition of PDE5A, BACE-1, and AChE could address multiple aspects of AD pathology.
CONCLUSION: 8-Prenyldaidzein shows strong potential as a multi-target inhibitor for AD treatment. While in-silico findings are promising, further experimental validation is needed to confirm its clinical applicability.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
40085681,A microglia clonal inflammatory disorder in Alzheimer's disease.,"Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however, few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in humans, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.",Elife,2025
39931431,RIPK1 expression and inhibition in tauopathies: implications for neuroinflammation and neuroprotection.,"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration/aggregation of TAU protein. One of the main challenges of these diseases is that they have neither biomarkers nor pharmacological targets to stop the neurodegenerative process. Apart from the neurodegenerative process, tauopathies are also characterized by a chronic low-grade neuroinflammation process, where the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) protein plays an essential role. Our research aimed to explore the role of RIPK1 in various tauopathies. We examined mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as brain tissue samples from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary form of 4R tauopathy, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered a secondary tauopathy. Our findings show elevated levels of RIPK1 mRNA levels across various forms of tauopathies, in both mouse models and human tissue samples associated with primary and secondary TAU-related disorders. Furthermore, we investigated the potential of using a RIPK1 inhibitor, known as GSK2982772, in a mouse model as a novel treatment strategy for FTD. The data showed that GSK2982772 treatment effectively reduced the reactive astrocyte response triggered by TAU<sup>P301L</sup> overexpression. However, this RIPK1 inhibitor failed to protect against the neurodegeneration caused by elevated TAU<sup>P301L</sup> levels in the hippocampal region. These results suggest that although inhibiting RIPK1 activity may help reduce TAU-related astrogliosis in the brain, the complexity of the inflammatory pathways involved could explain the absence of neuroprotective effects against TAU-induced neurodegeneration.",Front Neurosci,2024
40164724,A cerebrospinal fluid synaptic protein biomarker for prediction of cognitive resilience versus decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous. Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20-40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case-control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in Aβ<sup>+</sup> and phosphorylated tau<sup>+</sup> (A+T<sub>1</sub>+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations. Regarding cognitive prognosis, CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 predicted conversion from A+T<sub>1</sub>+ cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 7.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and A+T<sub>1</sub>+ mild cognitive impairment to dementia (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 2.2, P = 8.2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>) over a 15-year follow-up, adjusting for CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>, CSF neurofilament, CSF neurogranin, CSF growth-associated protein 43, age, APOE4 and sex. We also developed a plasma proteomic signature of CI, which we evaluated in 13,401 samples, which partly recapitulated CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 as a robust prognostic biomarker for cognitive resilience versus AD onset and progression, highlight the potential of plasma proteomics in replacing CSF measurement and further implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.",Nat Med,2025
40109017,Mediterranean vs. Western diet effects on the primate cerebral cortical pre-synaptic proteome: Relationships with the transcriptome and multi-system phenotypes.,"INTRODUCTION: Diet quality mediates aging-related risks of cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through poorly defined mechanisms.
METHODS: The effects of diet on the presynaptic proteome of the temporal cortex were assessed in 36 female cynomolgus macaques randomized to Mediterranean or Western diets for 31 months. Associations between the presynaptic proteome, determined by synaptometry by time-of-flight (SynTOF) mass spectrometry, adjacent cortex transcriptome, and multi-system phenotypes were assessed using a machine learning approach.
RESULTS: Six presynaptic proteins (DAT, Aβ42, calreticulin, LC3B, K48-Ubiquitin, SLC6A8) were elevated in the presynaptic proteome in Mediterranean diet consumers (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic data and multi-system phenotypes significantly predicted SynTOF markers. Selected SynTOF markers were correlated with changes in white matter volumes, hepatosteatosis, and behavioral and physiological measures of psychosocial stress.
DISCUSSION: These observations demonstrate that diet composition drives cortical presynaptic protein composition, that transcriptional profiles strongly predict the presynaptic proteomic profile, and that presynaptic proteins were closely associated with peripheral metabolism, stress responsivity, neuroanatomy, and socio-emotional behavior.
HIGHLIGHTS: Mediterranean and Western diets differentially altered the cortical presynaptic proteome, which is strongly associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Presynaptic proteomic markers were predicted by transcriptomic profiles in the adjacent cortex, and by multi-system anatomical, physiologic, and behavioral phenotypes. The data demonstrate that brain phenotypes and brain-body interactions are influenced by common dietary patterns, suggesting that improving diet quality may be an effective means to maintain brain health.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39740209,Roles of blood monocytes carrying TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and its therapeutic potential in APP/PS1 mice.,"INTRODUCTION: The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) arginine-47-histidine (R47H) mutation is a significant risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with unclear mechanisms. Previous studies focused on microglial amyloid-β (Aβ) phagocytosis with less attention on the impact of TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation on blood monocytes.
METHODS: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models were used to assess the contribution of blood monocytes carrying TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation to AD.
RESULTS: Aβ phagocytosis was compromised in mouse monocytes carrying the TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation. Transplantation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) carrying TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation increased cerebral Aβ burden and aggravated AD-type pathologies. Moreover, the replacement of TREM2<sup>R47H</sup>-BMCs restored monocytic Aβ phagocytosis, lowered Aβ levels in the blood and brain, and improved cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Our study reveals that blood monocytes carrying the TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and correcting the TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation in BMCs would be a potential therapeutic approach for those carrying this mutation.
HIGHLIGHTS: TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation compromises the Aβ phagocytosis of blood monocytes. Blood monocytes carrying TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation contribute substantially to AD pathogenesis. Correction of the TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> mutation in bone marrow cells ameliorates AD pathologies and cognitive impairments.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40151908,Gamma oscillation modulation for cognitive impairment: A systematic review.,"BackgroundGamma oscillation modulation has emerged as a potential non-invasive treatment to counteract cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), gamma sensory stimulation (GSS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) show promise in supporting specific cognitive functions.ObjectiveTo review and evaluate the efficacy of gamma oscillation modulation techniques in benefiting cognitive functions among individuals with AD and MCI.MethodsA systematic review was conducted, analyzing studies from 2015 to 2023 across databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria focused on studies involving tACS, GSS, or TMS applied to older adults with MCI or AD. A total of 438 articles were screened, of which 10 met the eligibility criteria.ResultsFindings suggest that gamma tACS, especially targeting the precuneus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, benefits episodic memory and cognitive performance. GSS also showed potential in supporting memory and attention, while TMS exhibited inconsistent but promising results when applied to the angular gyrus. However, heterogeneity in study designs and small sample sizes limit the generalizability of these outcomes.ConclusionsGamma oscillation modulation offers potential cognitive benefits for patients with AD and MCI, particularly in memory support. Further studies with larger samples and well-designed protocols are needed to confirm its therapeutic efficacy and optimize intervention parameters.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40168986,Molecular pathways and diagnosis in spatially resolved Alzheimer's hippocampal atlas.,"We employed Stereo-seq combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to investigate the gene expression and cell composition changes in human hippocampus with or without Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transcriptomic map, with single-cell precision, unveiled AD-associated alterations with spatial specificity, which include the following: (1) elevated synapse pruning gene expression in the fimbria of AD, with disrupted microglia-astrocyte communication likely leading to disorganized synaptic structure; (2) a globally increased energy generation in the cornu ammonis (CA) region, with varying degrees across its subregions; (3) a significant reduction in the number of CA1 neurons in AD, while CA4 neurons remained largely unaffected, potentially due to gene alterations in CA4 conferring resilience to AD; and (4) aggravated amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques in CA1 and stratum lucidum, radiatum, and moleculare (SLRM), and integration of Stereo-seq map with Aβ staining revealed a sequential enrichment of microglia and astrocytes around Aβ plaques. Finally, reduced brain-derived extracellular vesicles carrying cholecystokinin (CCK) and peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2) in AD plasma highlighted their diagnostic potential for clinical applications.",Neuron,2025
39917031,Diagnostic potential of urinary CX3CL1 for amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The role of the chemokine CX3CL1 in the processes of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is well-established. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic potential of urinary CX3CL1 levels in distinguishing between AD patients, those experiencing amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) individuals.
METHODS: A cohort comprising 516 CN individuals across various age groups, 102 AD patients, and 65 subjects with aMCI was assembled, alongside 93 age- and sex-matched CN controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to quantify urinary CX3CL1 levels.
RESULTS: Urinary CX3CL1 concentrations exhibited an age-dependent increase and demonstrated a positive correlation with age. Comparatively, AD patients exhibited significantly elevated urinary CX3CL1 levels when contrasted with both the CN controls and the aMCI cohort. Conversely, aMCI patients displayed urinary CX3CL1 levels that were notably reduced in comparison to both the AD and CN groups.
CONCLUSION: Urinary CX3CL1 levels correlate with the aging process and may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for both amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40116687,TMA-93 (binding by images): Cutoffs optimization based on Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"BackgroundWith the arrival of new disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), feasible cognitive tests, also for illiterate patients, are needed to screen those requiring deeper evaluation among individuals presenting with memory complaints. The TMA-93, a brief binding memory test, has proven useful for diagnosing early AD, and is supported by normative data that accounts for age and cognitive reserve.ObjectiveTo compare the sensitivity of different TMA-93 cutoffs in detecting AD pathology.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on a biobank sample of patients with confirmed AD pathology via amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The sensitivity of six TMA-93 cutoffs was evaluated: the 10th, 15th, and 20th percentiles based on traditional norming (TN) and regression-based norming (RBN). False negatives (FN) characteristics were also analyzed.ResultsA total of 270 AD-positive patients (96 by amyloid-PET, 174 by CSF biomarkers) were included, comprising 224 with mild cognitive impairment and 46 with mild dementia. The 15th percentile using RBN demonstrated substantial sensitivity (80.4%), higher than that of the 10th percentile, and also provided a more uniform distribution across normative groups compared to the TN approach. Higher global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) and, in patients over 70, lower cognitive reserve (Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire), were linked to a greater likelihood of FN results.ConclusionsThe 15th percentile cutoff based on RBN, accounting for age and cognitive reserve, improves sensitivity for detecting AD pathology, making it a valuable screening tool for memory complaints. Future normative data from biomarker-negative subjects may enhance the sensitivity of cognitive tests.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39748843,Adaptive measurement of cognitive function based on multidimensional item response theory.,"INTRODUCTION: Up to 20% of older adults in the United States have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and about one-third of people with MCI are predicted to transition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 5 years. Standard cognitive assessments are long and require a trained technician to administer. We developed the first computerized adaptive test (CAT) based on multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) to more precisely, rapidly, and repeatedly assesses cognitive abilities across the adult lifespan. We present results for a prototype CAT (pCAT-COG) for assessment of global cognitive function.
METHODS: We sampled items across five cognitive domains central to neuropsychological testing (episodic memory [EM], semantic memory/language [SM], working memory [WM], executive function/flexible thinking, and processing speed [PS]). The item bank consists of 54 items, with 9 items of varying difficulty drawn from six different cognitive tasks. Each of the 54 items has 3 response trials, yielding an ordinal score (0-3 trials correct). We also include three long-term memory items not designed for adaptive administration, for a total bank of 57 items. Calibration data were collected in-person and online, calibrated using a bifactor MIRT model, and pCAT-COG scores validated against a technician-administered neuropsychological battery.
RESULTS: The bifactor MIRT model improved fit over a unidimensional IRT model (p &lt; 0.0001). The global pCAT-COG scores were inversely correlated with age (r = -0.44, p &lt; 0.0001). Simulated adaptive administration of 11 items maintained a correlation of r = 0.94 with the total item bank scores. Significant differences between mild and no cognitive impairment (NCI) were found (effect size of 1.08 SD units). The pCAT-COG correlated with clinician-based global measure (r = 0.64).
DISCUSSION: MIRT-based CAT is feasible and valid for the assessment of global cognitive impairment, laying the foundation for the development of a full CAT-COG that will draw from a much larger item bank with both global and domain specific measures of cognitive impairment.
HIGHLIGHTS: As Americans age, numbers at risk for developing cognitive impairment are increasing.Aging-related declines in cognition begins decades prior to the onset of obvious cognitive impairment.Traditional assessment is burdensome and requires trained clinicians.We developed an adaptive testing framework using multidimensional item response theory.It is comparable to lengthier in-person assessments that require trained psychometrists.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40194029,Cost-effectiveness of Lecanemab for the Treatment of Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Canadian Societal Perspective (S23.001).,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of lecanemab versus standard of care (SoC) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), with confirmed beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology, from a Canadian societal perspective.
BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of lecanemab have previously been evaluated in the Phase 3 randomized clinical trial, Clarity AD (NCT03887455). Despite this, the cost-effectiveness of lecanemab compared with the current SoC remains uncertain.
DESIGN/METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed, with health states determined by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Transitions between health states during month 0-18 were estimated from Clarity AD. Beyond month 18, results previously reported from analysis of National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data were used, with relative efficacy for lecanemab in the form of the hazard ratio for time-to-worsening of CDR-SB, taken from Clarity AD Core Study. The model assumes a constant rate of discontinuation, and all patients would discontinue lecanemab after developing moderate AD, or upon institutionalization. The model included the effects of lost productivity and impact on carer health-related quality of life. Unit costs were taken from publicly available sources, and utility values for each health state were taken from published literature. A lifetime time horizon was adopted. Costs and benefits were both discounted at 1.5%.
RESULTS: Treatment with lecanemab was associated with an incremental cost of CAD 77,710 and a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 1.24. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for lecanemab vs SoC was therefore estimated to be CAD 62,751 per QALY gained. The probability that lecanemab was cost-effective at a threshold of CAD 100,000 was estimated to be 88.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab represents a cost-effective option for the treatment for early AD from the Canadian societal perspective. The results of this analysis can be used to inform clinical and economic decision making.

40063697,Correlating hippocampal and amygdala volumes with neuropathological burden in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative pathologies using 7T postmortem MRI.,"Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), is common in elderly brains and often seen in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). LATE-NC typically begins in the amygdala and spreads to the hippocampus and neocortex. Whether it contributes to hippocampal and amygdala atrophy in Down syndrome (DS) remains unexplored. We analyzed amygdala and hippocampal volumes and neuropathological burden in 12 DS cases and 54 non-DS cases with AD and related neurodegenerative pathologies (ADRNP) using 7 Tesla (7T) postmortem ex vivo MRI. Postmortem and antemortem hippocampal volumes were significantly correlated in a subset of 17 cases with available antemortem MRI scans. DS cases had smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes than ADRNP cases; these correlated with more severe Braak stage but not with Thal phase. LATE-NC and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) were uncommon in DS cases. In ADRNP cases, lower hippocampal volumes associated with dementia duration, advanced Thal phase, Braak NFT stage, C score, LATE-NC stage, HS and arteriolosclerosis severity; reduced amygdala volumes correlated with severe LATE-NC stage, HS, and arteriolosclerosis severity, but not with Thal phase or Braak NFT stage. Lewy body pathology did not affect hippocampal or amygdala volume in either cohort. Thus, hippocampal volumes in ADRNP were influenced by both ADNC and LATE-NC, and amygdala volumes were primarily influenced by LATE-NC. In DS, hippocampal and amygdala volumes were primarily influenced by tau pathology.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2025
39722190,Proteome profiling of cerebrospinal fluid using machine learning shows a unique protein signature associated with APOE4 genotype.,"Proteome changes associated with APOE4 variant carriage that are independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and diagnosis are unknown. This study investigated APOE4 proteome changes in people with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and no impairment. Clinical, APOE genotype, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and AD biomarker data was sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Proteome profiling was done using supervised machine learning. We found an APOE4-specific proteome signature that was independent of cognitive diagnosis and AD pathological biomarkers, and increased the risk of progression to cognitive impairment. Proteins were enriched in brain regions including the caudate and cortex and cells including endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Enriched peripheral immune cells included T cells, macrophages, and B cells. APOE4 carriers have a unique CSF proteome signature associated with a strong brain and peripheral immune and inflammatory phenotype that likely underlies APOE4 carriers' vulnerability to cognitive decline and AD as they age.",Aging Cell,2024
40025717,Association of mid-age Life's Essential 8 score with digital cognitive performance and incident Alzheimer's disease: The Framingham Heart Study.,"BackgroundCardiovascular health (CVH) is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies examining the association between mid-age CVH, as indicated by Life's Essential 8 (LE8) health metrics, and digital cognitive performance or AD risk are limited.ObjectiveTo examine the associations between mid-age CVH, assessed by LE8 scores during ages 45 to 65, and digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) performance as well as the incidence of AD.MethodsWe included 1198 participants (51.6% women) from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. Linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the associations between mid-age CVH and dCDT performance, as well as the incidence of AD.ResultsOver a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 45 participants developed AD. Each standard deviation (SD) higher mid-age LE8 total score was associated with a 0.16 SD higher level of the dCDT total score (p < 0.001) and a 0.35-fold lower risk of incident AD (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p = 0.003). The dCDT measures showed stronger associations with mid-age LE8 and AD risk compared to the conventional CDT (cCDT). For example, the drawing score on copy tasks was more strongly associated with LE8 (beta = 0.10, p = 0.007 versus beta = 0.08, p = 0.27) and had higher discrimination for incident AD (C-statistic = 0.89 versus 0.83) compared to the cCDT.ConclusionsOur results highlight the potential of digital cognitive assessments for evaluating AD risk and emphasize the importance of mid-age CVH in shaping cognitive outcomes and the development of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39913612,ALS plasma biomarkers reveal neurofilament and pTau correlate with disease onset and progression.,"OBJECTIVE: We performed a pilot screen to assess the utility of the NULISA™ (Nucleic-acid-Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay) platform in the identification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) biomarkers.
METHODS: Plasma from 86 individuals (48 ALS, 18 asymptomatic C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers (AsymC9), and 20 healthy controls) was analyzed via a multiplexed NULISA™ assay that includes 120 neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Statistical analysis of NULISA™ results was performed to identify proteins differentially expressed in plasma and their correlation with disease-associated parameters.
RESULTS: ALS plasma showed elevation of the established biomarkers, neurofilament light chain (NEFL) and neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH). Compared to controls and AsymC9, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217), phosphorylated tau 231 (pTau231), and phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) were elevated in ALS. NEFL levels positively correlated with pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and pTDP-43. MAPT and pTDP-43 were also correlated with pTau181, pTau217 and pTau231. Elevated pTau was negatively correlated with survival and ALSFRS-R. Spinal onset ALS was associated with higher pTau181, pTau217, and pTau231.
INTERPRETATION: We confirm previous reports showing elevated pTau181 in ALS plasma and show elevation of other phosphorylated tau forms, pTau217 and pTau231, typically observed in Alzheimer's disease. We provide preliminary data showing the detection and elevation of pTDP-43-409/410 in a subset of ALS samples compared to healthy controls. Neurofilament and tau levels are highly correlated suggesting their elevation may reflect a common pathology and disease state. Total and phosphorylated tau are correlated with multiple disease measures, such as ALS duration, ALSFRS-R, and site of onset.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2025
40189807,Brain cholinergic terminal density utilizing [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol PET in adults with Down's syndrome: Relationship to amyloid PET and cognitive performance.,"BACKGROUND: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) have increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cholinergic system declines in AD, underlying many cognitive deficits. We investigated the relationship between amyloid accumulation and cholinergic terminal density in adults with DS compared to amyloid-matched controls.
METHODS: A total of 15 non-demented adults with DS and 15 amyloid-matched healthy controls were assessed for [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake differences and [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake relationships with amyloid accumulation and cognitive performance.
RESULTS: Adults with DS displayed greater [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake than controls, with a similar uptake pattern. Amyloid-associated differences in [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake were observed in adults with DS. [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake in adults with DS was positively associated with cognition.
DISCUSSION: Adults with DS display higher [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake than amyloid-matched controls but relatively lower [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEOBV uptake in individuals with elevated amyloid. Thus, the cholinergic system appears to be adversely affected by AD pathology in individuals with DS, which may be relevant to cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Adults with DS display greater cholinergic terminal density in specific ROIs than amyloid-match controls. Adults with DS exhibit a similar pattern of cholinergic terminal density across the brain. The first association of cholinergic terminal density with AD pathology in non-demented adults with DS. Adults with DS display a greater cholinergic terminal decline in association with amyloid accumulation than neurotypically developed age-matched controls.

39703357,The application of artificial intelligence in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that severely impacts cognitive function, posing significant physical and psychological burdens on patients and substantial economic challenges to families and society, particularly in aging populations where its prevalence is rising. Current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments and non-pharmacological interventions, exhibit considerable limitations in early diagnosis, etiological treatment, and disease management. This study aims to investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the early diagnosis and progression monitoring of AD through a bibliometric analysis of relevant literature. A systematic search in the Web of Science Core Collection identified 530 publications related to AI and AD, consisting of 361 original research articles and 169 review articles, with a notable increase in annual publication rates, particularly between 2019 and 2024. The United States and China emerged as leading contributors, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. Institutional analysis revealed that Harvard University and Indiana University System are at the forefront, highlighting the role of academic institutions in fostering interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease was identified as the most influential publication outlet. Key highly cited papers provided essential theoretical foundations for ongoing research. This study underscores the growing relevance of AI in AD research and suggests promising avenues for future investigations, particularly in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies through advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques.",Front Neurol,2024
39767773,Maresin-like 1 Ameliorates Neuropathology of Alzheimer's Disease in Brains of a Transgenic Mouse Model.,"(1) Background: Impeded resolution of inflammation contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); consequently, resolving inflammation is pivotal to the amelioration of AD pathology. This can potentially be achieved by the treatment with specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), which should resolve neuroinflammation in brains. (2) Methods: Here, we report the histological effects of long-term treatment with an SPM, maresin-like 1 (MarL1), on AD pathogenesis in a transgenic 5xFAD mouse model. (3) Results: MarL1 treatment reduced Aβ overload, curbed the loss of neurons in brains especially cholinergic neurons associated with cleaved-caspase-3-associated apoptotic degeneration, reduced microgliosis and the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization of microglia, curbed the AD-associated decline in anti-inflammatory Iba1<sup>+</sup>Arg-1<sup>+</sup>-M2 microglia, inhibited phenotypic switching to pro-inflammatory N1 neutrophils, promoted the blood-brain barrier-associated tight-junction protein claudin-5 and decreased neutrophil leakage in 5xFAD brains, and induced the switch of neutrophils toward the inflammation-resolving N2 phenotype. (4) Conclusions: Long-term administration of MarL1 mitigates AD-related neuropathogenesis in brains by curbing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, based on the histological results. These findings provide preclinical leads and mechanistic insights for the development of MarL1 into an effective modality to ameliorate AD pathogenesis.",Biomedicines,2024

39877657,Effects of acupuncture at the Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) points on functional connectivity with the retrosplenial cortex in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been demonstrated to have a promising effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is one of the earliest brain regions affected in AD, and changes in its functional connectivity (FC) are reported to underlie disease-associated memory impairment. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in patients with AD.
METHODS: Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 14 AD patients and 14 normal controls (NCs) matched by age, sex, and educational level at baseline. After the baseline MRI scan, acupuncture stimulation on the Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) points was performed for 3 min. Then, another 10 min of fMRI data were acquired after the needle was withdrawn. A dataset that included 100 healthy participants was also included to construct a reliable FC map of the RSC. Two sets of regions of interest (ROIs) in the RSC were selected to assess the sustained effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in AD patients and NCs.
RESULTS: Two sets of RSC ROI-based analyses demonstrated robust positive connectivity with the hippocampus (HPC). Furthermore, multiple brain regions, including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and right precuneus, showed decreased FC with the RSC in the AD group and increased FC with the RSC in the NC group after acupuncture compared to that at baseline. Acupuncture also specifically elicited increased FC between the RSC and the HPC as well as between the RSC and the parahippocampal gyrus in AD patients and decreased FC between the RSC and the visual cortices in NCs. Additionally, diminished FC with the RSC was correlated with neuropsychological scale scores in the AD group before acupuncture treatment.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that acupuncture at Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) can exert bidirectional and benign regulatory effects on RSC connectivity in AD patients.",Front Neurosci,2024
39807644,Unraveling the bidirectional link between cancer and dementia and the impact of cancer therapies on dementia risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Observational studies on the cancer-dementia relationship have yielded controversial results. This study systematically reviews the evidence to clarify this association. We searched Embase, Global Health, Ovid Medline, and APA PsycInfo. Colorectal and lung cancers showed the greatest risk reduction for all-cause dementia (ACD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively, while melanoma and colorectal cancers had the largest reduction in vascular dementia (VaD). Prostate cancer survivors on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) had a higher risk of ACD/AD, while breast cancer patients on tamoxifen had a lower AD risk. Chemotherapy was linked to a reduced AD risk. ACD patients saw a 30% risk reduction for bladder, colorectal, and lung cancers, while AD patients had a ≈ 35% reduction for bladder and lung cancers. Our study urges clinicians to monitor cognitive function in cancer patients, especially those on ADT, tamoxifen, or chemotherapy and highlights the need for research into cancer-dementia mechanisms. HIGHLIGHTS: Cancer survivors have an 8% to 14% lower risk of dementia, while those with dementia have a 25% lower cancer risk. Colorectal and non-melanoma skin cancers were associated with reduced risks of all-cause dementia (ACD; 16%/9%), Alzheimer's disease (AD; 13%/5%), and vascular dementia (VaD; 24%/9%). Lung cancer reduced AD risk by 17%, and melanoma reduced VaD risk by 27%. ACD and AD patients had lower risks of lung (30%/36%), bladder (32%/34%), breast (26%/20%), and colorectal (31%/28%) cancers. Tamoxifen and chemotherapy reduced AD risk, while androgen deprivation therapy increased ACD risk.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39980634,Blood-based biomarkers in mild behavioral impairment: an updated overview.,"Identifying individuals at-risk for dementia is one of the critical objectives of current research efforts, highlighting the need for simple, cost-effective, and minimally invasive biomarkers. Mild behavioral impairment (MBI), characterized by the emergence of persistent neuropsychiatric manifestations in older adults, has attracted increasing attention as a potential early indicator of cognitive decline and dementia. A growing number of studies have recently begun to explore the relationship between MBI and several blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, neurodegeneration, as well as systemic metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation. In this context, MBI has been associated with lower plasma Aβ42/Αβ40 ratio, higher plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), increased neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, as well as disturbances in metabolic markers, including homocysteine, insulin and ferritin, suggesting a multifaceted neurobiological basis for this syndrome. These findings offer insights into the underlying pathophysiology of MBI, and connection between neuropsychiatric symptoms and progression of AD. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize and critically discuss the emerging literature evidence linking MBI to blood-based biomarkers, hoping to shed more light on MBI's pathophysiology, its connection to AD-related neurobiology, as well as its potential practical utility for predicting cognitive impairment, guiding early interventions and managing the risk for dementia.",Front Neurol,2025
40142767,The Unseen Burden: A Qualitative Investigation of Polish LGBTQ+ Caregivers' Experiences.,"Background/Objectives: As the world's population ages, the growing number of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) will undoubtedly continue to impose social and economic challenges. Informal caregivers play a crucial role in providing essential support for individuals with ADRD. However, there is limited research that investigates the psychosocial functioning of caregivers (partners) from minoritized groups. Methods: This study aimed to explore the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) caregivers of individuals with ADRDs. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with seven caregivers of partners diagnosed with ADRDs. Three themes were identified based on reflexive thematic analysis: (i) experiencing familial alienation; (ii) fear about the future; and (iii) finding strength in the face of adversity. Results: The research highlighted difficulties reported by LGBTQ+ caregivers, while also showing how such caregivers cope. The findings provide a basis for developing targeted interventions for caregivers from minoritized groups. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for policy and intervention development concerning LGBTQ+ caregivers' mental and physical health outcomes.",J Clin Med,2025
39804889,Rural Roads to cognitive Resilience (RRR): A prospective cohort study protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution, detrimental built and social environments, social isolation (SI), low socioeconomic status (SES), and rural (versus urban) residence have been associated with cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Research is needed to investigate the influence of ambient air pollution and built and social environments on SI and cognitive decline among rural, disadvantaged, ethnic minority communities. To address this gap, this cohort study will recruit an ethnoracially diverse, rural Florida sample in geographic proximity to seasonal agricultural burning. We will (1) examine contributions of smoke-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposures to SI and cognitive function; (2) determine effects of built and social environments on SI and cognitive function; and (3) contextualize SI and cognitive function among residents from different ethnoracial groups during burn and non-burn seasons.
METHODS: We will recruit 1,087 community-dwelling, dementia-free, ≥45-year-olds from five communities in Florida's Lake Okeechobee region. Over 36 months, participants will complete baseline visits to collect demographics, health history, and health measurements (e.g., blood pressure, body mass index) and 6-month follow-ups assessing cognitive function and social isolation at each visit. A subsample of 120 participants representative of each community will wear smartwatches to collect sensor data (e.g., heart rate) and daily routine and predefined activities (e.g., GPS-captured travel, frequent destinations) over two months. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) (e.g., whether smoke has bothered participant in last 30 minutes) will occur over two months during agricultural burning and non-burning months. PurpleAir monitors (36 total) will be installed in each community to continuously monitor outdoor PM2.5 levels.
DISCUSSION: We expect to identify individual- and community-level factors that increase the risk for SI and cognitive decline in a vulnerable rural population.",PLoS One,2025
39857829,The Role of Air Pollution and Olfactory Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.,"The escalating issue of air pollution contributes to an alarming number of premature fatalities each year, thereby posing a significant threat to global health. The focus of recent research has shifted towards understanding its potential association with neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is recognised for its characteristic deposition of toxic proteins within the brain, leading to a steady deterioration of cognitive capabilities, memory failure, and, ultimately, death. There is burgeoning evidence implying that air pollution may be a contributing factor to this protein build up, thereby intensifying the course of AD. It has been demonstrated that the olfactory system, responsible for smell perception and processing, acts as a potential gateway for airborne pollutants to inflict brain damage. This review aims to elucidate the relationship between air pollution, olfactory deterioration, and AD. Additionally, this review aims to highlight the potential mechanisms through which pollutants might instigate the development of AD and the role of the olfactory system in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, the diverse model systems employed in exploring the correlation, public health policy ramifications, and prospective directions for future research will be discussed.",Biomedicines,2025
39693350,GSK3β phosphorylation catalyzes the aggregation of tau into Alzheimer's disease-like filaments.,"The pathological deposition of proteins is a hallmark of several devastating neurodegenerative diseases. These pathological deposits comprise aggregates of proteins that adopt distinct structures named strains. However, the molecular factors responsible for the formation of distinct aggregate strains are unknown. Here, we show that the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β catalyzes the aggregation of the protein tau into Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like filaments. We demonstrate that phosphorylation by GSK3β, but not by several other kinases, promotes the aggregation of full-length tau as well as enhances phase separation into gel-like condensate structures. Cryoelectron microscopy further reveals that the fibrils formed by GSK3β-phosphorylated tau adopt a fold comparable to that of paired helical filaments isolated from the brains of AD patients. Our results elucidate the intricate relationship between posttranslational modification and the formation of tau strains in neurodegenerative diseases.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2024
40116653,"Associations among diurnal cortisol, melatonin, and agitation in people living with cognitive impairment.","BackgroundWhile the underlying mechanisms of agitation are not fully understood in people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, research suggests that dysregulated neuroendocrine processes, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may play a role.ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the associations between salivary cortisol, melatonin at baseline, and agitation both at baseline and at post-intervention.MethodsThis study was a secondary analysis of a two-group, randomized, parallel designed clinical trial of 210 people living with cognitive impairment. Agitation, salivary cortisol, and salivary melatonin were measured at baseline and four weeks. Salivary cortisol and melatonin indicators were generated through three timepoints of cortisol and melatonin collection across the two consecutive days. Presence of agitation was measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Logistic regressions were conducted to achieve the aim.ResultsA significant association was found at baseline between diurnal cortisol slope and agitation (OR = 0.03, p = 0.029), there were no relationships between all other cortisol or melatonin indicators with agitation. Cortisol awaking response (OR = 0.16, p = 0.048), its percentage (OR = 0.27, p = 0.021) and its increase higher than 50% (OR = 0.09, p = 0.009), were significant with agitation at four weeks.ConclusionsGiven the potential link between cortisol and agitation, exploring cortisol-lowering interventions like minimizing environmental stressors, smoothing transitions to different situations, stress-reduction techniques, and behavioral therapies may aid in managing agitation in older adults with cognitive impairment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39955563,Retinal ganglion cell vulnerability to pathogenic tau in Alzheimer's disease.,"Pathological tau isoforms, including hyperphosphorylated tau at serine 396 (pS396-tau) and tau oligomers (Oligo-tau), are elevated in the retinas of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD dementia. These patients exhibit significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss, however the presence of tau isoforms in RGCs and their impact on RGC integrity, particularly in early AD, have not been studied. Here, we analyzed retinal superior temporal cross-sections from 25 MCI or AD patients and 16 age- and sex-matched cognitively normal controls. Using the RGC marker ribonucleic acid binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) and Nissl staining, we found a 46-56% reduction in RBPMS<sup>+</sup> RGCs and Nissl<sup>+</sup> neurons in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of MCI and AD retinas (P &lt; 0.05-0.001). RGC loss was accompanied by soma hypertrophy (10-50% enlargement, P &lt; 0.05-0.0001), nuclear displacement, apoptosis (30-50% increase, P &lt; 0.05-0.01), and prominent expression of granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) bodies and GVD-necroptotic markers. Both pS396-tau and Oligo-tau were identified in RGCs, including in hypertrophic cells. PS396-tau<sup>+</sup> and Oligo-tau<sup>+</sup> RGC counts were significantly increased by 2.1-3.5-fold in MCI and AD retinas versus control retinas (P &lt; 0.05-0.0001). Tauopathy-laden RGCs strongly inter-correlated (r<sub>P</sub>=0.85, P &lt; 0.0001) and retinal tauopathy associated with RGC reduction (r<sub>P</sub>=-0.40-(-0.64), P &lt; 0.05-0.01). Their abundance correlated with brain pathology and cognitive deficits, with higher tauopathy-laden RGCs in patients with Braak stages (V-VI), clinical dementia ratings (CDR = 3), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE ≤   26) scores. PS396-tau<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the central and mid-periphery showed the closest associations with disease status, while Oligo-tau<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the mid-periphery exhibited the strongest correlations with brain pathology (NFTs, Braak stages, ABC scores; r<sub>S</sub>=0.78-0.81, P &lt; 0.001-0.0001) and cognitive decline (MMSE; r<sub>S</sub>=-0.79, P = 0.0019). Overall, these findings identify a link between pathogenic tau in RGCs and RGC degeneration in AD, involving apoptotic and GVD-necroptotic cell death pathways. Future research should validate these results in larger and more diverse cohorts and develop RGC tauopathy as a potential noninvasive biomarker for early detection and monitoring of AD progression.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
39897456,Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using rhythmic power changes and phase differences: a low-density EEG study.,"OBJECTIVES: The future emergence of disease-modifying treatments for dementia highlights the urgent need to identify reliable and easily accessible tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and cost-effective technique commonly used in the study of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the specific alterations in EEG biomarkers associated with AD remain unclear when using a limited number of electrodes.
METHODS: We studied pathological characteristics of AD using low-density EEG data collected from 26 AD and 29 healthy controls (HC) during both eye closed (EC) and eye opened (EO) resting conditions. The analysis including power spectrum, phase lock value (PLV), and weighted lag phase index (wPLI) and power-to-power frequency coupling (theta/beta) analysis were applied to extract features in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands.
RESULTS: During the EC condition, the AD group exhibited decreased alpha power compared to HC. Additionally, both analysis of PLV and wPLI in the theta band indicated that the alterations in the AD brain network predominantly involved in the frontal region with the opposite changes. Moreover, the AD group had increased frequency coupling in the frontal and central regions. Surprisingly, no group difference was found in the EO condition. Notably, decreased theta band functional connectivity within the fronto-central lobe and increased frequency coupling in frontal region were found in AD group from EC to EO. More importantly, the combination of EC and EO quantitative EEG features improved the inter-group classification accuracy when using support vector machine (SVM) in older adults with AD. These findings highlight the complementary nature of EC and EO conditions in assessing and differentiating AD cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the potential of utilizing low-density EEG data from resting-state paradigms, combined with machine learning techniques, to improve the identification and classification of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39837297,Hearing Loss as a Risk Factor for Dementia: A Nationwide 15-Year Follow-Up Cohort Study in Taiwan.,"INTRODUCTION: Although hearing loss is associated with dementia, the exact causal relationship between hearing loss and dementia remains unclear. Early detection and prevention of hearing loss are essential. In this study, data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan were used to monitor patients with hearing loss for 15 years to determine whether hearing loss leads to dementia.
METHODS: This retrospective matched-cohort study involved 208,570 individuals, divided into 41,714 patients with hearing loss and 166,856 controls matched by sex, age, and chronic diseases. Cox regression analysis was conducted on data obtained from the NHIRD for the period 2000-2015 to determine the hazard ratio (HR) associated with dementia.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients with hearing loss who developed dementia was higher than that of the control group (18.67% vs. 14.10%). The onset age of dementia was younger in the hearing loss group (69.95 vs. 70.31 years, p = 0.001). Middle-aged individuals (45-65 years) with hearing loss were more likely to develop dementia compared with those without hearing loss (48.53% vs. 47.94%, p = 0.03). Compared with the controls, the patients with hearing loss were more likely to develop hyperlipidemia and stroke. In the patients with hearing loss, the adjusted HRs for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, and other types of dementia were significant. The patients were followed up for an average of 7.82 years. Compared with the controls, the patients with hearing loss exhibited a shorter mean time to dementia onset (5.21 vs. 5.49 years, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Hearing loss may increase the risks of AD, dementia, hyperlipidemia, and stroke. Therefore, health-care providers should closely monitor cardiovascular complications in patients with hearing loss.",Neuroepidemiology,2025
39778694,Neural mechanisms of non-pharmacological interventions in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: An ALE meta-analysis.,"Non-pharmacologic interventions are effective for persons showing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to systematically quantify the results of 19 neuroimaging studies in order to identify brain regions in which patients showed stable increases or decreases in activation after interventions. We also tested the moderating effects of disease stage (MCI vs. AD) and intervention modality (cognitive training vs. exercise intervention). The results showed increased activation in the cuneus, precuneus and medial frontal gyrus in the combined groups after treatment, whereas the anterior cingulate gyrus showed decreased activation. Secondly, in the MCI group there was increased activation in the precuneus and precentral gyrus after treatment, whereas there was decreased activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus; in the AD group there was only increased activation after treatment, including in the lingual gyrus and bilateral superior temporal gyrus. Finally, the bilateral cuneus and precentral gyrus showed increased activation after cognitive training, while bilateral insula, among others, showed decreased activation. This suggests that there are brain activation changes after non-pharmacological treatments for MCI and AD patients, but that the treatment mechanisms are moderated by stage and intervention modality. Future studies could continue to explore specific neural mechanisms involved in different intervention conditions for these patients.",Exp Gerontol,2025
40110480,Comparing the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in Alzheimer's disease: a network meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impairs cognitive function and daily living abilities, representing a major public health challenge. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, effective therapeutic interventions targeting both cognitive and functional decline are critical. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the therapeutic effects of music therapy, acupuncture therapy, game therapy, cognitive training therapy, and exercise therapy on AD patients through a network meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up until 2024 were systematically retrieved from multiple databases. Data were extracted, including the first author, publication year, country, total sample size, mean participant age, type and duration of intervention, and outcome measures such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, Activities of Daily Living, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. Statistical analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17 software. The analysis included 52 RCTs with a total of 3,409 participants, offering a strong dataset. The results indicated that game therapy produced statistically significant improvements in mental state and daily living abilities, while acupuncture therapy yielded the most pronounced improvements in cognitive function among AD patients. Notably, the comparative efficacy of these interventions suggests that game therapy may offer short-term benefits, particularly for mental health and functional abilities, whereas acupuncture therapy demonstrated superior long-term cognitive enhancements. In conclusion, tailored physical and cognitive interventions such as game therapy and acupuncture therapy may hold significant potential in optimizing treatment outcomes for AD patients, with implications for both clinical practice and future research.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39754275,The cerebral blood flow response to neuroactivation is reduced in cognitively normal men with β-amyloid accumulation.,"BACKGROUND: Accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cerebral deposition of Aβ initiates deteriorating pathways which eventually can lead to AD. However, the exact mechanisms are not known. A possible pathway could be that Aβ affects the cerebral vessels, causing inadequate cerebrovascular function. In the present study, we examined if Aβ accumulation is associated with a reduced cerebral blood flow response (CBF) to neuronal activation by visual stimulation (ΔCBF<sub>Vis.Act.</sub>) in cognitively normal subjects from the Metropolit Danish Male Birth Cohort.
METHODS: 64 subjects participated in the present study. ΔCBF<sub>Vis.Act.</sub> was measured using arterial spin labelling (ASL) combined with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Neuronal activation was obtained by visual stimulation by a flickering checkerboard presented on a screen in the MRI-scanner. Brain Aβ accumulation and cerebral glucose metabolism were assessed by PET imaging using the radiotracers [<sup>11</sup>C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) and [<sup>18</sup>F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), respectively. Cortical thickness was measured from structural MRI.
RESULTS: ΔCBF<sub>Vis.Act.</sub> correlated negatively ( β = -32.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): -60.2; -4.1], r = -0.30, p = 0.025) with PiB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) in the brain regions activated by visual stimulation. ΔCBF<sub>Vis.Act.</sub> did not correlate with FDG SUVr ( β = 1.9 [CI: -23.8; 27.6], r = 0.02, p = 0.88) or cortical thickness ( β = 10.3 [CI: -8.4; 29.0], r = 0.15, p = 0.27) in the activated brain regions. Resting CBF did not correlate with PiB SUVr neither in the regions activated by visual stimulation ( β = -17.8 [CI:-71.9; 36.2], r =- 0.09, p = 0.51) nor in the remaining cortex ( β = 5.2 [CI:-3.9; 14.2], r = 0.15, p = 0.26).
CONCLUSION: We found a correlation between high PiB SUVr and reduced CBF response to neuronal activation, indicating a link between Aβ accumulation and impaired cerebrovascular function. The impairment was not associated with cortical thinning or hypometabolism, suggesting that Aβ accumulation affecting brain vessel function could be a very early pathology leading to neurodegenerative disease.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39762903,Effects of Alzheimer's disease plasma marker levels on multilayer centrality in healthy individuals.,"BACKGROUND: Changes in amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau brain levels are known to affect brain network organization but very little is known about how plasma markers can relate to these measures. We aimed to address the relationship between centrality network changes and two plasma pathology markers: phosphorylated tau at threonine 231 (p-tau231), a proxy for early Aβ change, and neurofilament light chain (Nfl), a marker of axonal degeneration.
METHODS: One hundred and four cognitively unimpaired individuals were divided into a high pathology load (33 individuals; HP) group and a low pathology (71 individuals; LP) one. All participants underwent a magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording, a neuropsychological evaluation and plasma sampling. With the MEG recordings, a compound centrality score for each brain source was calculated that considered both intra- and inter-band links. For each group, the relationship between this centrality score and the two plasma markers was studied by means of correlation analyses. Furthermore, the relationship between the centrality score and the plasma markers among the HP and LP groups was compared. Lastly, we investigated whether hubs were more intensely affected by these changes.
RESULTS: Increasing concentrations of p-tau231, which is a proxy of Aβ pathology, were associated with greater theta centrality score of posterior areas that increased their connectedness in the theta range with the remaining areas, regardless of the latter's frequency range. The opposite relationship was found for left areas that decreased their centrality score in the gamma frequency range. These results only emerged for HP individuals, who showed a significantly different relationship between centrality and p-tau231 compared to LP individuals. Hubs' centrality score in the theta band was significantly more affected by p-tau231 levels compared to less central regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Early brain network reorganizations in cognitively unimpaired individuals are associated with elevated plasma p-tau231, a proxy for very early Aβ changes, only among individuals who show signs of a higher pathology load. Posterior centrality score increases in the theta band are congruent with previous literature and theoretical models, while gamma centrality score losses could be associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Hubs were more intensely affected by p-tau231, and changed to a higher degree, thus corroborating hubs' vulnerability.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39854134,"Educational attainment, Aβ, tau, and structural brain reserve in Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with higher educational attainment (EA) often exhibit better cognitive function. However, the relationship among EA status, AD pathology, structural brain reserve, and cognitive decline requires further investigation.
METHODS: We compared cognitive performance across different amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (A ±) statuses and EA levels (High EA/Low EA). We examined the effects of Aβ plaques, tau tangles, and gray matter volume (GMV) on the relationship between EA and domain-specific cognitive decline.
RESULTS: A+/High-EA individuals exhibited slower cognitive decline in global cognition and language domains than A+/Low-EA individuals. This cognitive benefit was independently and synergistically explained by reduced AD pathology, including lower Aβ and tau burdens, as well as preserved GMV. Additionally, High-EA individuals experienced a median delay of 1.9 years in the onset of significant brain atrophy among A+ individuals.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the independent and synergistic contributions of EA-associated AD pathology and GMV alterations to longitudinal cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals with high educational attainment (EA) show slower declines in global cognition and language. EA-related slower cognitive decline is linked to reduced tau and greater gray matter volume in AD. AD individuals with high EA show a median 1.9 year delayed onset of brain atrophy.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40108057,Use of Drugs Affecting GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors and the Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: a Meta-Analysis and Literature Review.,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system is known for its role in cognitive functions and memory processes. However, the activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and their associated pathways influence the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), a key hallmark in the development and prognosis of research examining the relationship between the use of drugs affecting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. This study aimed to examine the association between GABAA receptor-affecting drugs and the risk of AD and dementia, focusing on benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and anesthetics. This meta-analysis included all English articles on AD, dementia, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist medications published before May 2024. The articles were identified through searches conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases. The extracted data were analyzed using STATA software (version 14.2). Q statistics and the I<sup>2</sup> index were used to evaluate heterogeneity, while Egger's test and funnel plot were utilized to detect publication bias. A total of 19 articles (10 case-control and 9 cohort articles) were eligible for the analysis, involving 2,953,980 patients. The use of GABA agonists was found to have a statistically significant relationship with the development of dementia (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.29, I<sup>2</sup> = 87.6%) and AD (RR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.6%). In the drug-based subgroup, we observed that zolpidem consumption was associated with an increased incidence of AD and dementia (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08-1.52, I<sup>2</sup> = 24.3%), similar to the effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs; RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18, I<sup>2</sup> = 87.2%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the duration of follow-up, which ranged from 5 to 11 years across the studies, was significantly associated with heterogeneity (P = 0.036). Our findings indicate that the use of zolpidem and BZD is associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40189829,Neighborhood disadvantage and the incidence of dementia in US Black women.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the association of neighborhood disadvantage with the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the longitudinal Black Women's Health Study (BWHS).
METHODS: The study included 10,915 BWHS participants enrolled in Medicare for at least 1 year from 2012 to 2020. The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was assigned to participant residential block groups over follow-up. ADRD cases were identified from Medicare files.
RESULTS: Age- and education-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for ADRD increased as neighborhood disadvantage increased, to 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.91) in the most disadvantaged quintile compared to the least disadvantaged quintile, with a significant linear trend (p = 0.012). Associations remained, although somewhat attenuated, when individual income was controlled.
DISCUSSION: The present study adds to the evidence showing an association between living in a disadvantaged neighborhood and poorer brain health. The area-level association of deprivation with ADRD was in part explained by individual differences in socioeconomic status (SES).
HIGHLIGHTS: The study assessed neighborhood deprivation in the largest cohort of US Black women. Cases of dementia were ascertained from Medicare claims files over 9 years of follow-up. Higher levels of area deprivation were associated with higher dementia risk.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40179214,Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease: Oxidative stress in the neurodegenerative process.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) generally show neuropathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD). The trisomy of chromosome 21 causes an imbalance of antioxidant systems, which can be linked to AD pathophysiology.
OBJECTIVE: Verify the difference between the activity of antioxidant enzymes and products of the oxidation process in peripheral blood in non-trisomic (NT) and trisomic (DS) adults and elders and respective associations with cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A total of 120 subjects were included in this study. Sociodemographic and clinical information were collected as per protocol for participants in DS and NT groups. The cognitive state of the DS participants was established according to the Brazilian version of the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with Down's syndrome and Others with Intellectual Disabilities (CAMDEX-DS). The CAMDEX interview was used for this purpose for participants in the NT group. Plasma samples were collected to evaluate protein carbonyl content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE).
RESULTS: We found increased levels of SOD and CAT activity in the DS group. When the groups were stratified by cognitive decline, elevated levels of SOD and CAT activity were found both in DS groups with and without decline. The activity of GPx was similar between the groups, as well as MDA and HNE.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that alterations of the antioxidative processes can be implicated in the onset of neurodegeneration observed in individuals with DS.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39707423,Cognitive decline profiles associated with lewy pathology in the context of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and Lewy pathology (LP) often coexist in cognitively impaired individuals. These pathologies' relative distribution and severity may modify these individuals' clinical presentation, cognitive profile, and prognosis. Therefore, we examined the contributions of LP and concomitant ADNC to disease survival and profiles of cognitive decline in preclinical and clinical stages in a large neuropathologically diagnosed group.
METHODS: We evaluated 597 participants with LP and 491 participants with intermediate/high ADNC in the absence of LP from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) database. At baseline, 237 participants were cognitively normal (CN), 255 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 596 with dementia. Cognition was assessed using three cognitive domain scores (i.e., Memory, Executive, and Language) from the NACC Uniform Dataset (UDS) neuropsychological test battery, MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Multivariate adaptive regression splines were used to evaluate associations between baseline cognitive scores and mean annual rate of change over two years. The likelihood of progression to MCI or dementia was assessed using Cox hazard models.
RESULTS: Neocortical LP, independent of the clinical diagnosis, was associated with lower Executive and higher Language and Memory scores at baseline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with lower Memory and Language scores. Similarly, neocortical LP was associated with faster Executive decline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with faster Memory and Language decline. A clinical diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (i.e., a strong LP phenotype) was associated with the LP cognitive profile and shorter disease duration. Progression to incident MCI or dementia was primarily associated with the degree of tau pathology; neocortical LP or a diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia only predicted progression when those with intermediate/high ADNC were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: LP and ADNC differentially affected cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive profiles in a large autopsy sample. Concomitant Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology had a strong impact on clinical progression in those with LP, regardless of the initial stage. Thus, LB and ADNC co-pathology interact to affect cognitive domains that may be used to track Lewy Body disease longitudinally and as outcome measures in therapeutic trials.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39988572,Retinal vascular alterations in cognitive impairment: A multicenter study in China.,"INTRODUCTION: Foundational models suggest Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be diagnosed using retinal images, but the specific structural features remain poorly understood. This study investigates retinal vascular changes in individuals with cognitive impairment in three East Asian regions.
METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Ningxia, collecting retinal images from 176 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and 264 controls. The VC-Net deep learning model segmented arterial/venous networks, extracting 36 vascular features.
RESULTS: Significant reductions in vessel length, segment number, and vascular density were observed in cognitively impaired patients, while venous structure and complexity were correlated with the level of cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Retinal vascular changes may serve as indicators of cognitive impairment, requiring validation in larger cohorts and exploration of the underlying mechanisms.
HIGHLIGHTS: A deep learning segmentation model extracted diverse retinal vascular features. Significant alterations in the structure of retinal arterial/venous networks were identified. Partitioning vessel-rich retinal zones improved detection of vascular changes. Decreases in vessel length, segment number, and vascular density were found in CI individuals.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39710068,The role of the neurovascular unit in vascular cognitive impairment: Current evidence and future perspectives.,"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a progressive cognitive impairment caused by cerebrovascular disease or vascular risk factors. It is the second most common type of cognitive impairment after Alzheimer's disease. The pathogenesis of VCI is complex, and neurovascular unit destruction is one of its important mechanisms. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is responsible for combining blood flow with brain activity and includes endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and many regulatory nerve terminals. The concept of an NVU emphasizes that interactions between different types of cells are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. A stable NVU is the basis of normal brain function. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the neurovascular unit and its role in VCI development is crucial for gaining insights into its pathogenesis. This article reviews the structure and function of the neurovascular unit and its contribution to VCI, providing valuable information for early diagnosis and prevention.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39881680,MicroRNAs signatures as potential molecular markers in mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by a decline in cognitive functioning without significant interference in daily activities. Its high heterogeneity and elevated conversion rate to dementia pose challenges for accurate diagnosis and monitoring, highlighting the urgent need to identify methodologies focused on the early detection and intervention of MCI. Due to their biological characteristics, microRNAs (miRNAs) are potential candidates as non-invasive molecular markers for the identification and assessment of MCI progression. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the miRNAs commonly deregulated in MCI, focusing on expression profiles in plasma, serum, and extracellular vesicle samples. Our analysis identified eight upregulated miRNAs, including hsa-miR-149-3p, and four downregulated miRNAs, such as Let-7f-5p. Notably, hsa-miR-149-3p emerged as a central node in interaction networks, suggesting its crucial role in regulating cellular processes relevant to MCI. Additionally, pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation and neurodegeneration. Our results underscore the potential of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive molecular markers for MCI and open the possibility for new methodologies that enable more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Validating the expression of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-149-3p and Let-7f-5p, along with identifying their functional role in the specific context of MCI, is essential to establish their biological relevance. This work contributes to the understanding of the miRNA profile in mild cognitive impairment using easily accessible samples, which could be useful for the development of various strategies aimed at preventing or delaying MCI in individuals at risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39987247,Fokker-Planck diffusion maps of microglial transcriptomes reveal radial differentiation into substates associated with Alzheimer's pathology.,"The identification of microglia subtypes is important for understanding the role of innate immunity in neurodegenerative diseases. Current methods of unsupervised cell type identification assume a small noise-to-signal ratio of transcriptome measurements to produce well-separated cell clusters. However, identification of subtypes can be obscured by gene expression noise, which diminishes the distances in transcriptome space between distinct cell types, blurs boundaries, and reduces reproducibility. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion maps to model cellular differentiation as a stochastic process whereby cells settle into local minima that correspond to cell subtypes, in a potential landscape constructed from transcriptome data using a nearest neighbor graph approach. By applying critical transition fields, we identify individual cells on the verge of transitioning between subtypes, revealing microglial cells in an inactivated, homeostatic state before radially transitioning into various specialized subtypes. Specifically, we show that cells from Alzheimer's disease patients are enriched in a microglia subtype associated to antigen presentation and T-cell recruitment, and are depleted in an anti-inflammatory subtype.",Commun Biol,2025
39841474,Cerebral Microbleeds and Amyloid Pathology Estimates From the Amyloid Biomarker Study.,"IMPORTANCE: Baseline cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and APOE ε4 allele copy number are important risk factors for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) receiving therapies to lower amyloid-β plaque levels.
OBJECTIVE: To provide prevalence estimates of any, no more than 4, or fewer than 2 CMBs in association with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy number, and age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data included in the Amyloid Biomarker Study data pooling initiative (January 1, 2012, to the present [data collection is ongoing]). Data from 15 research and memory clinic studies were pooled and harmonized. Participants included individuals for whom data on age, cognitive status, amyloid status, and presence of CMBs were available. Data were analyzed from October 22, 2023, to April 26, 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were age, cognitive status, amyloid status and presence, location, and number of CMBs. Presence of amyloid pathology was determined based on 42 amino acid-long form of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42) levels in cerebrospinal fluid or on amyloid-positron emission tomography. Presence and, in a subset, location (lobar vs deep) and number of CMBs were determined on magnetic resonance imaging (locally with visual rating).
RESULTS: Among 4080 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 66.5 (8.9) years, and 2241 (54.9%) were female. A total of 2973 participants had no cognitive impairment (cognitive unimpairment [CU]), and 1107 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia (ADD). One thousand five hundred and thirteen participants (37.1%) had amyloid pathology, 1368 of 3599 (38.0%) with data available were APOE ε4 carriers, and 648 (15.9%) had CMBs. In the CU group, amyloid pathology and APOE ε4 copy number were not associated with presence of any, no more than 4, or fewer than 2 CMBs but were associated with increased odds of lobar CMBs (odds ratio [OR] for amyloid, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.20-1.69], P < .001; OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.19-2.74], P = .006; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.83-1.46], P = .49; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.64 [95% CI, 0.90-2.97], P = .11; overall P = .02). In the MCI-ADD group, amyloid pathology was associated with presence of any CMBs (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.17-1.96], P = .002), no more than 4 CMBs (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.18-1.82], P = .002), and fewer than 2 CMBs (OR 1.34 [95% CI, 1.03-1.74], P = .03) but not lobar CMBs. APOE ε4 copy number was associated with presence of any (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.72 [95% CI, 0.88-3.35], P = .11; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.59-1.04], P = .09; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.32-3.67], P = .002; overall P < .001) and no more than 4 CMBs (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.64-2.68], P = .45; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.54-1.04], P = .08; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.97-3.19], P = .06; overall P = .03) but not with fewer than 2 or lobar CMBs. Prevalence estimates of CMBs ranged from 6% at 50 years of age in a non-APOE ε4 allele carrier with no amyloid pathology and no cognitive impairment to 52% at 90 years of age in an APOE ε4 homozygote carrier with amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of 4080 participants, prevalence estimates of CMBs were associated with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy number, and age. CMB prevalence estimates may help inform safety evaluations for antiamyloid clinical trials.",JAMA Netw Open,2025
40063637,"Kaempferia parviflora extract and its methoxyflavones as potential anti-Alzheimer assessing in vitro, integrated computational approach, and in vivo impact on behaviour in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), a growing global challenge, lacks effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. This study explored the promising potential of the Kaempferia parviflora (KP) and its methoxyflavones (MFs) against the disease. We evaluated KP extract and its five MFs for antioxidant capacity, cholinesterase inhibition (AChE, and BChE), amyloid plaque (Aβ) reduction, neuroprotection, and memory improvement in a mouse model. HPLC quantified the five MFs in KP extract, with 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (F1) being the most abundant. 5,7,4'-Trimethoxyflavone (F3) and 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (F4) exhibited the strongest AChE and BChE inhibitory activities, respectively. MFs hindered Aβ1-42 aggregation and destabilized fibrils, with F3 showing the potent anti-aggregation and the strongest fibril destabilization. They also protected SH-SY5Y cells from Aβ1-42-induced damage. Notably, F3 combined anti-cholinesterase and anti-Aβ activities, suggesting its potential as a multi-target agent. KP extract ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice, suggesting its potential for cognitive improvement. These findings revealed that KP can be a promising candidate for herbal medicine development against AD. Its multi-target MFs offered a unique advantage by targeting multiple AD pathways. KP may have a great potential to modify the disease and overcome the challenge of drug development as cognitive enhancing herbal medicine.",PLoS One,2025
39811702,Identifying cognitive test scores associated with early tau burden in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to identify cognitive tests that optimally relate to tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), a neocortical region associated with early tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the harvard aging brain study (HABS) (n = 128) and the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study (n = 393). We used elastic net regression to identify the most robust cognitive correlates of tau PET signal in the ITC. Secondary analyses examined whether the cognitive correlates remained significantly associated with tau after adjusting for structural brain measures.
RESULTS: Episodic memory measures, including both total and ""process"" scores, were the most robust correlates of ITC tau across both cohorts. These cognitive test scores remained significant after accounting for structural brain measures.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of specific episodic memory test scores to detect and monitor neuropathological changes associated with early AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning identified cognitive correlates of early Alzheimer's disease tau burden.Both traditional and process scores predicted early tau burden.Episodic memory scores were among the strongest correlates.Cognitive scores remained significant after accounting for structural brain measures.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39775330,Association between self-reported and proxy informant Health Quality of life of older adults with the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes. A cross-sectional study.,"INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotic prescriptions are frequent in nursing homes due to the challenging management of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to assess the association between Health-related Quality Of Life (HrQOL) and antipsychotic use in nursing homes.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of the KASEHPAD (Karukera Study of Ageing in Nursing Homes) study conducted in six nursing homes in Guadeloupe and Martinique (French West Indies). The EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used to measure HRQoL. Clinical characteristics and use of antipsychotic drugs of 194 older adults with both self-reported and proxy informant HrQOL index were extracted. Other outcomes measures included the frequency and severity of delusions, hallucinations and agitation using the reduced Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home (NPI-R) score, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 81.3 years and 63.6% had major cognitive impairment (MMSE score ≤18). The prevalence of delusions (39.7%), hallucinations (27.8%) and agitation (40.7%) was high. Antipsychotic medication was prescribed to 37.1% of the participants. The self-reported HrQOL Index of older adults was higher than the proxy HrQOL Index (0.54 ± 0.43 versus 0.40 ± 0.43) with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 (p<0.001). The use of antipsychotic medication was associated with a higher self-reported HrQOL index, after controlling for the frequency (β = 0.144, p = 0.024) or severity (β = 0.159, p = 0.009) of delusions, hallucinations and agitation symptoms. Conversely, antipsychotic use was not associated with proxy HrQOL Index.
CONCLUSION: Despite the adverse effects of long-term use of antipsychotic drugs in older adults, it is associated with better-perceived HrQOL among nursing home residents. However, this association was not observed when HrQOL was assessed by proxy informants. This finding may explain the challenges in reducing the use of this therapeutic class in nursing homes.",PLoS One,2025
39885106,Prospective Investigation Unravels Plasma Proteomic Links to Dementia.,"Investigating plasma proteomic signatures of dementia offers insights into its pathology, aids biomarker discovery, supports disease monitoring, and informs drug development. Here, we analyzed data from 48,367 UK Biobank participants with proteomic profiling. Using Cox and generalized linear models, we examined the longitudinal associations between proteomic signatures and dementia-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization analysis was employed to identify causal associations, and machine learning algorithms were applied to develop protein-based models for dementia prediction. We identified 74 proteins significantly associated with the risk of various types of dementia and cognitive functions after Bonferroni correction. Among these, strong associations were observed for growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL), across all types of dementia. Additionally, 15 proteins demonstrated significant associations with neuroimaging-defined dementia endophenotypes. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses further substantiated causal relationships between dementia-associated proteins and Alzheimer's disease, particularly involving GDF15, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET), and GFAP. Moreover, we identified three protein modules associated with dementia, primarily linked to immune system processes, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism, providing insights into potential biological pathways underlying the disease. Furthermore, we proposed a ten-protein panel capable of forecasting dementia over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.837-0.876). Our results revealed dementia-associated plasma proteomic signatures, and their causal relationships, notably GDF15-RET signaling with Alzheimer's disease, and proposed a promising protein panel for high-risk dementia screening.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40012393,Use of Virtual Reality to Improve Spatial Orientation in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, neurodegenerative condition that leads to a significant cognitive decline. One of the symptoms that greatly reduces the quality of daily functioning is the deterioration of spatial orientation abilities. A non-pharmacological treatment option for Alzheimer's disease, which is also employed to improve the cognitive functioning of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, is virtual reality training.
OBJECTIVE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no existing systematic review on the use of virtual reality training to enhance spatial orientation in individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. The review was therefore conducted to fill this gap. The findings of this review may support the efficacy of virtual reality in enhancing spatial orientation.
METHODS: Five databases were searched. The primary inclusion criteria were study participants aged over 60 years with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment and the use of virtual reality for improving spatial orientation. Six studies meeting these criteria were ultimately included in the review.
RESULTS: All included studies demonstrated an improvement in the spatial orientation of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment following virtual reality training. This indicates the effectiveness of virtual reality technology in cognitive rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: As virtual reality cognitive training has proven effective, its use should be more widely adopted. Further research on the application of virtual reality for enhancing spatial orientation in individuals with dementia is recommended.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
39845735,Amyloid-β and tau deposition in traumatic brain injury: a study of Vietnam War veterans.,"Traumatic brain injury is widely viewed as a risk factor for dementia, but the biological mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. In previous studies, traumatic brain injury has been associated with the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease, i.e. amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau. Depending on the type and location of trauma, traumatic brain injury can induce spatially heterogeneous brain lesions that may pre-dispose for the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology in aging. Therefore, we hypothesized that a history of traumatic brain injury may be related to spatially heterogeneous amyloid-β and tau pathology patterns that deviate from the stereotypical temporo-parietal patterns in Alzheimer's disease. To test this, we included 103 Vietnam War veterans of whom 65 had experienced traumatic brain injury (n = 40, 38.8% mild; n = 25, 24.3% moderate/severe). Most individuals had a history of 1 (n = 35, 53.8%) or 2 (n = 15, 23.1%) traumatic brain injury events. We included the group without a history of traumatic brain injury (n = 38, 36.9%) as controls. The majority was cognitively normal (n = 80, 77.7%), while a subset had mild cognitive impairment (n = 23, 22.3%). All participants underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]florbetapir/Amyvid amyloid-β PET and [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir/Tauvid tau-PET 39.63 ± 18.39 years after their last traumatic brain injury event. We found no differences in global amyloid-β and tau-PET levels between groups, suggesting that a history of traumatic brain injury does not pre-dispose to accumulate amyloid-β or tau pathology in general. However, we found that traumatic brain injury was associated with altered spatial patterns of amyloid-β and tau, with relatively greater deposition in fronto-parietal brain regions. These regions are prone to damage in traumatic brain injury, while they are typically only affected in later stages of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, in our traumatic brain injury groups, the association between amyloid-β and tau was reduced in Alzheimer-typical temporal regions but increased in frontal regions that are commonly associated with traumatic brain injury. Altogether, while acknowledging the relatively small sample size and generally low levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology in this sample, our findings suggest that traumatic brain injury induces spatial patterns of amyloid-β and tau that differ from patterns observed in typical Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, traumatic brain injury may be associated with a de-coupling of amyloid-β and tau in regions vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease. These findings indicate that focal brain damage in early/mid-life may change neurodegenerative trajectories in late-life.",Brain Commun,2025
40129402,Validating a brief performance-based measure of cognition and daily functioning in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundThe Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale is widely used as a cognitive and functional measure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. Given its time and personnel burden, there is a need to more efficiently identify patients who warrant further evaluation or clinical trial qualification. To potentially address this need, a novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning has been developed for use in AD research and clinical care.ObjectiveTo test whether this novel performance-based test is associated with levels of daily functioning in both impaired and unimpaired individuals.MethodsOne-hundred-seventy-one participants (72 cognitively unimpaired; 53 amnestic mild cognitive impairment; 46 mild AD) completed the novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning, as well as the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) for estimating global CDR.ResultsThe novel test was significantly associated with the QDRS Total, as well as the Behavioral and Cognitive subdomains, and differentiated between estimated global CDR scores of 0 versus ≥0.5. No significant effect of age, sex, or education on the performance-based test was observed.ConclusionsThe performance-based test used in this study can be considered a measure of cognition and daily functioning. As such, it may be a quick, objective method for identifying impaired individuals who may qualify for clinical trial enrollment or may warrant further evaluation without the need for informant input.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40193955,"Ensemble deep learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using MRI: Integrating features from VGG16, MobileNet, and InceptionResNetV2 models.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to distinctive patterns of neuronal dysfunction and the cognitive decline emblematic of dementia. Currently, over 5 million individuals aged 65 and above are living with AD in the United States, a number projected to rise by 2050. Traditional diagnostic methods are fraught with challenges, including low accuracy and a significant propensity for misdiagnosis. In response to these diagnostic challenges, our study develops and evaluates an innovative deep learning (DL) ensemble model that integrates features from three pre-trained models-VGG16, MobileNet, and InceptionResNetV2-for the precise identification of AD markers from MRI scans. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of individual models in handling varying image shapes and textures, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. The ultimate goal is to support primary radiologists by streamlining the diagnostic process, facilitating early detection, and enabling timely treatment of AD. Upon rigorous evaluation, our ensemble model demonstrated superior performance over contemporary classifiers, achieving a notable accuracy of 97.93%, along with a specificity of 98.04%, sensitivity of 95.89%, precision of 95.94%, and an F1-score of 87.50%. These results not only underscore the efficacy of the ensemble approach but also highlight the potential for DL to revolutionize AD diagnosis, offering a promising pathway to more accurate, early detection and intervention.",PLoS One,2025
39988573,Examining multimorbidity contributors to dementia over time.,"INTRODUCTION: Multimorbidity is associated with increased risk of dementia, but previous estimation of the joint contribution of constituent conditions to dementia incidence did not model additive contributions or temporal proximity in the sequential onset of conditions.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from 9944 Health and Retirement Study participants and Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, ages 68-99, without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) at baseline, from 1998-2016. ADRD and chronic condition were encoded using validated claims algorithms. We estimated the absolute contribution of eight conditions to ADRD with the longitudinal extension of the average attributable fraction (LE-AAF).
RESULTS: Hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and arthritis additively accounted for 71.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.9%-79.1%) of ADRD incident cases based on LE-AAF.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that multimorbidity plays a pivotal role in ADRD incidence. Targeting constituents of a cardiovascular path to dementia may contribute most to lowering dementia risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Most dementia cases (71.8%) were attributable to eight chronic conditions. Hypertension was the largest contributor to dementia risk. Confidence intervals were smallest for constituents of a cardiovascular path to dementia. Longitudinal extension of the average attributable fractions (LE-AAFs) explicitly consider longitudinal patterns of comorbidities. Acute myocardial infarction did not contribute significantly to dementia incidence.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

Dysbiosis may influence neurodegeneration by affecting gut permeability and neurotrophic factors, leading to cognitive decline. The study analyzed microbiome differences between patients with AD and healthy individuals, as well as the impact of various interventions in both preclinical and clinical studies. Of 60 studies reviewed, 12 were excluded from the meta-analysis due to unsuitable data or lack of control groups. Meta-analyses revealed significant cognitive impairment in AD patients and animal models, with specific tests identifying these deficits. Notably, Bacteroides levels were higher in patients with AD, whereas probiotics improved Prevotella levels. Natural treatments increased Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes in animal models. The findings emphasize the need for standardized methods to develop therapies targeting the gut microbiota to restore cognition in AD. Understanding individual dysbiosis could further clarify the cognitive effects of the gut-brain axis.
HIGHLIGHTS: Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Patients with AD show significant differences in Bacteroides levels compared to healthy individuals.Probiotic treatments increase Prevotella levels in AD animal models.Natural agents boost Bacteroidetes and reduce Firmicutes in AD animal models.Human studies show no consistent effects of gut microbiota interventions on cognitive function in AD.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2024
39732824,Concordance and test-retest consistency of sleep biomarker-based neurodegenerative disorder profiling.,"Biomarkers that aid in early detection of neurodegeneration are needed to enable early symptomatic treatment and enable identification of people who may benefit from neuroprotective interventions. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep biomarkers may be useful, given the bi-directional relationship between sleep and neurodegeneration and the prominence of sleep disturbances and altered sleep architectural characteristics in several neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to demonstrate that sleep can accurately characterize specific neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). A four-class machine-learning algorithm was trained using age and nine sleep biomarkers from patients with clinically-diagnosed manifest and prodromal NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD = 27), Lewy body dementia (LBD = 18), and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD = 15), as well as a control group (CG = 58). The algorithm was validated in a total of 381 recordings, which included the training data set plus an additional AD = 10, iRBD = 18, Parkinson disease without dementia (PD = 29), mild cognitive impairment (MCI = 78) and CG = 128. Test-retest consistency was then assessed in LBD = 10, AD = 9, and CG = 46. The agreement between the NDD profiles and their respective clinical diagnoses exceeded 75% for the AD, LBD, and CG, and improved when NDD participants classified Likely Normal with NDD indications consistent with their clinical diagnosis were considered. Profiles for iRBD, PD and MCI participants were consistent with the heterogeneity of disease severities, with the majority of overt disagreements explained by normal sleep characterization in 27% of iRBD, 21% of PD, and 26% of MCI participants. For test-retest assignments, the same or similar NDD profiles were obtained for 88% of LBD, 86% in AD, and 98% of CG participants. The potential utility for NDD subtyping based on sleep biomarkers demonstrates promise and requires further prospective development and validation in larger NDD cohorts.",Sci Rep,2024
39836940,"Association of Polygenic Risk Score for 5 Diseases With Alzheimer Disease Progression, Biomarkers, and Amyloid Deposition.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increase AD risk and progression. This study aimed to examine the genetic predisposition to these conditions and their effect on AD pathophysiology, risk, and progression.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a North American prospective cohort. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for OSA, T2D, coronary artery disease (CAD), major depression, and body mass index (BMI) were generated for 752 non-Hispanic White participants with whole-genome sequencing data. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between PRSs and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Time to progression across PRS quartiles was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. PET amyloid and tau deposition rates, regional neocortical atrophy, and cognitive composite score declines were compared across OSA PRS quartiles using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
RESULTS: Among 463 ADNI participants with baseline MCI (mean age 72.6 ± 7.3 years, 43.4% female), the OSA PRS, adjusted for BMI, was significantly associated with MCI-to-AD progression. The highest OSA PRS quartile had an odds ratio of 1.86 (95% CI 1.03-3.37) at 3 years and 2.02 (95% CI 1.16-3.51) at 5 years, compared with the lowest quartile. PRSs for T2D, CAD, major depression, and BMI were not associated with MCI-to-AD progression. Participants in the highest OSA PRS quartile had higher PET amyloid deposition and greater cognitive decline. In 752 participants (mean age 74.1 ± 7.3 years, 43.6% female), OSA PRS was significantly associated with baseline levels of PET amyloid, CSF amyloid-β 42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), visinin-like protein 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and plasma neurofilament light after multiple testing adjustments.
DISCUSSION: Individuals with high polygenic susceptibility to OSA exhibited an increased risk of MCI-to-AD progression and a higher amyloid deposition rate, suggesting potential modifier effects of OSA or OSA-associated genes on AD progression and pathophysiology. However, the small sample size and lack of objective OSA diagnosis limit interpretation of these genetic effects.",Neurology,2025
40145390,Efficacy of Communication Bridge-2 for primary progressive aphasia: A randomized controlled trial of communication intervention.,"INTRODUCTION: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language-based neurodegenerative dementia, negatively impacts communication and quality of life. Previous non-pharmacologic interventions show promise but lack efficacy trials. Here, outcomes are provided from Communication Bridge-2 (CB2), a speech-language randomized controlled trial (RCT) for PPA.
METHODS: CB2 is the first Phase 2, Stage II, parallel-group RCT delivered via video chat with global enrollment. Ninety-five dyads were randomized into one of two speech-language intervention arms. Primary outcomes included communication confidence and participation measures. Marginal linear models assessed efficacy across ≈12 months.
RESULTS: Ninety-five dyads were randomized from four countries. Experimental arm superiority in communication-participation measurement of goal attainment was demonstrated (66.7% vs 49.1%, respectively, p = 0.006), and corroborated by post-study interviews.
DISCUSSION: Outcomes demonstrate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a person-centered telemedicine intervention for maximizing communication participation for mild-to-moderate PPA, providing a pathway for developing and implementing clinically meaningful interventions for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
HIGHLIGHTS: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) negatively impacts communication participation. Communication Bridge-2 (CB2) is a telemedicine-delivered randomized controlled trial (RCT). Global recruitment of 95 PPA participant dyads into an RCT with low dropout. First international superiority trial for PPA using video chat shows efficacy. The study provides a model for rigorous non-pharmacologic trials for Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD).",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39994784,Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid levels of VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 in a dementia with Lewy bodies clinical cohort stratified by Alzheimer's pathophysiological biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Synaptic protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may represent much-needed objective biomarkers of cognitive impairment, disease progression and drug efficacy in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNARE) proteins, such as VAMP-2 and SNAP-25, are implicated in α-synuclein pathophysiology and CSF levels of these proteins are associated with pathophysiological biomarkers and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to compare CSF levels of VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 in patients with DLB to cognitively unimpaired controls and AD patients and study their association with cognitive performance and AD and neurodegeneration biomarkers.
METHODS: VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were quantified in CSF from cognitively normal controls (n = 62), DLB (n = 44) and AD (n = 114) patients from the Sant Pau Initiative for Neurodegeneration (SPIN) cohort using homebrew Single Molecule Array assays (Simoa). The DLB group was stratified into two groups with (""DLB + AD"", n = 28) or without AD co-pathology (""pure DLB"", n = 16) using our validated cut-off for the CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau)/Aβ42 ratio. We used linear regression to test for group differences (adjusting for age) and association with AD biomarkers. We used standardized w-scores of the cognitive tests to analyze the association of the synaptic markers with cognitive performance.
RESULTS: CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 levels correlated across all groups (r = 0.71-0.9, p &lt; 0.001). Both proteins were decreased in pure DLB (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.01) but increased in DLB + AD (p = 0.01, p = 0.02) compared to controls and showed good accuracy to discriminate pure DLB from DLB + AD (AUC = 0.84, 0.85). Both proteins were associated with CSF p-tau and total tau (t-tau) across all groups (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.49-0.88, p &lt; 0.001), with the Aβ42/40 ratio in DLB + AD (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.29-0.36, p &lt; 0.001) and in AD (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.12-0.23, p &lt; 0.001) and with CSF neurofilament-light chain (NfL) in controls (r²=0.10-0.11, p &lt; 0.001-0.01) and AD patients (r²=0.01-0.08, p = 0.01 - 0.001). SNAP-25 was associated with CSF NfL in the DLB + AD group (r²=0.15, p = 0.02). CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were associated with phonemic fluency in pure DLB (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.39 - 0.28, p = 0.01-0.03) and SNAP-25 with the Clock drawing test and the MMSE in DLB + AD (adj.r<sup>2</sup> = 0.15 - 0.14, p = 0.03-0.03) and DLB (adj.r<sup>2</sup> = 0.12 - 0.08, p = 0.02-0.04) groups.
CONCLUSIONS: CSF VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 are promising surrogate markers of synapse degeneration in DLB. However, care should be taken when interpreting CSF levels of these synaptic markers in DLB in light of the confounding effect of AD pathophysiological markers.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39737667,Non-APOE variants predominately expressed in smooth muscle cells contribute to the influence of Alzheimer's disease genetic risk on white matter hyperintensities.,"INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHVs) are disproportionally prevalent in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially reflecting neurovascular injury. We quantify the association between AD polygenic risk score (AD-PRS) and WMHV, exploring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are proximal to genes overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species.
METHODS: In a UK-Biobank sub-sample (mean age = 64, range = 45-81 years), we associate WMHV with (1) AD-PRS estimated via SNPs across the genome (minus apolipoprotein E [APOE] locus) and (2) AD-PRS estimated with SNPs proximal to specific genes that are overexpressed in cerebrovascular cell species.
RESULTS: We observed a positive association between non-APOE-AD-PRS and WMHVs. We further demonstrate an association between WMHVs and AD-PRS constructed with SNPs that are proximal to genes over-represented in smooth muscles cells (SMCs; β = 0.135, P<sub>FWE</sub> <sub> </sub>&lt; 0.01) and internally replicated (P<sub>DISCOVERY+REPLICATION </sub>&lt; 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Common AD genetic risk could explain physiological processes underlying vascular pathology in AD. SMC function may offer a treatment target to prevent WMHV-related AD pathophysiology prior to the onset of symptoms.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, link to increased white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). WMHVs indicate vascular risk and neurovascular injury in AD. The broader genetic link between AD risk and WMHV is not fully understood. We quantify AD polygenic risk score (PRS) associations with WMHV, excluding APOE. AD-PRS in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) shows a significant association with increased WMHV.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

39752902,Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (FLT1) interactions with amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease: A putative biomarker of amyloid-induced vascular damage.,"We have identified FLT1 as a protein that changes during Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereby higher brain protein levels are associated with more amyloid, more tau, and faster longitudinal cognitive decline. Given FLT1's role in angiogenesis and immune activation, we hypothesized that FLT1 is upregulated in response to amyloid pathology, driving a vascular-immune cascade resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We sought to determine (1) if in vivo FLT1 levels (CSF and plasma) associate with biomarkers of AD neuropathology or differ between diagnostic staging in an aged cohort enriched for early disease, and (2) whether FLT1 expression interacts with amyloid on downstream outcomes, such as phosphorylated tau levels and cognitive performance. Additionally, we sought to replicate FLT1 interactions in the brain. The results showed that higher levels of FLT1 in CSF and post-mortem brain tissue related to increased tau, particularly among amyloid positive individuals. These analyses help clarify the potential utility of FLT1 as a biomarker among individuals with evidence of brain amyloidosis.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39740133,Lactylation of tau in human Alzheimer's disease brains.,"INTRODUCTION: Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (tauopathy) is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, a metabolic shift due to the Warburg effect results in increased lactate production. Lactate can induce a post-translational modification (PTM) on proteins that conjugates lactyl groups to lysine (K) residues, which is known as lactylation.
METHODS: We analyzed lactylation of tau in control and AD brain tissue and conducted cell-based assays. In addition, we used in vitro assays to determine whether p300 catalyzed tau lactylation.
RESULTS: Quantitative proteomics detected that tau lactylation was elevated in AD brains, with K residue at position 331 (K331) being a prominent site. Lactate induced tau lactylation, which increased tau phosphorylation and cleavage and reduced ubiquitination. Inhibition of lactate production lowered tau lactylation; p300 catalyzed tau lactylation.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that tau lactylation links metabolic dysregulation with tauopathy and could serve as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.
HIGHLIGHTS: Elevated tau lactylation, particularly at K331, is evident in in human AD brain samples. Lactate induces tau lactylation, enhancing phosphorylation and cleavage while inhibiting ubiquitination. The acetyl-transferase p300 catalyzes tau lactylation, with K331 being the most prominent site.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40183431,Rising rates of hospitalization for dementia in people with type 2 diabetes and the general population in Australia.,"BackgroundFew recent studies have examined the trends in dementia hospitalization in high-income countries.ObjectiveTo estimate the trends in hospitalization for dementia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and the general population in Australia using linked, national databases.MethodsAustralians with T2DM and registered on the National Diabetes Services Scheme (n = 438,264), and the general population (n = 8,090,993) from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017 served as the study cohort. Annual rates of hospitalization for dementia were calculated for these individuals aged ≥50 years. Following this, the trends in the rate of hospitalization were estimated using joinpoint regression and summarized as annual percent changes (APCs).ResultsIncreases in hospitalization for dementia over time were observed for the T2DM and the general population; APC 5.2 (95% CI 3.5, 7.3) and 9.4 (95% CI 3.8, 14.3), respectively. The absolute age- and sex-standardized rate of dementia hospitalization was found to be higher in the T2DM than the general population. For vascular dementia, a higher rate of hospitalization was observed for the T2DM population compared to the general population. Conversely, the rate of hospitalization for Alzheimer's disease was higher in the general population than in the T2DM cohort. Further, a higher dementia hospitalization rate was observed among males compared to females in both T2DM, and the general population.ConclusionsDespite the previous studies reporting a decline in dementia incidence in high-income countries, the rate of dementia hospitalization in Australia has risen steadily from 2010-2016 in both T2DM individuals and the general population.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39934151,Human and mouse proteomics reveals the shared pathways in Alzheimer's disease and delayed protein turnover in the amyloidome.,"Murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms but have limitations in fully representing AD molecular complexities. Here we present the comprehensive, age-dependent brain proteome and phosphoproteome across multiple mouse models of amyloidosis. We identified shared pathways by integrating with human metadata and prioritized components by multi-omics analysis. Collectively, two commonly used models (5xFAD and APP-KI) replicate 30% of the human protein alterations; additional genetic incorporation of tau and splicing pathologies increases this similarity to 42%. We dissected the proteome-transcriptome inconsistency in AD and 5xFAD mouse brains, revealing that inconsistent proteins are enriched within amyloid plaque microenvironment (amyloidome). Our analysis of the 5xFAD proteome turnover demonstrates that amyloid formation delays the degradation of amyloidome components, including Aβ-binding proteins and autophagy/lysosomal proteins. Our proteomic strategy defines shared AD pathways, identifies potential targets, and underscores that protein turnover contributes to proteome-transcriptome discrepancies during AD progression.",Nat Commun,2025
40102464,Stages prediction of Alzheimer's disease with shallow 2D and 3D CNNs from intelligently selected neuroimaging data.,"Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for successful diagnosis and treatment, involving the common practice of screening for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, the progressive nature of AD makes it challenging to identify its causal factors. Modern diagnostic workflows for AD use cognitive tests, neurological examinations, and biomarker-based methods, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. While these methods are effective, non-invasive imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining importance. Deep Learning (DL) approaches for evaluating alterations in brain structure have focused on combining MRI and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the spatial architecture of DL. This combination has garnered significant research interest due to its remarkable effectiveness in automating feature extraction across various multilayer perceptron models. Despite this, MRI's noisy and multidimensional nature requires an intelligent preprocessing pipeline for effective disease prediction. Our study aims to detect different stages of AD from the multidimensional neuroimaging data obtained through MRI scans using 2D and 3D CNN architectures. The proposed preprocessing pipeline comprises skull stripping, spatial normalization, and smoothing. It is followed by a novel and efficient pixel count-based frame selection and cropping approach, which renders a notable dimension reduction. Furthermore, the learnable resizer method is applied to enhance the image quality while resizing the data. Finally, the proposed shallow 2D and 3D CNN architectures extract spatio-temporal attributes from the segmented MRI data. Furthermore, we merged both the CNNs for further comparative analysis. Notably, 2D CNN achieved a maximum accuracy of 93%, while 3D CNN reported the highest accuracy of 96.5%.",Sci Rep,2025
39994987,Transcranial electrical stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease: Current uses and challenges.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently rarely effective drug treatments available to halt or slow down its progression. With the aging of the world population, AD as the primary cause of dementia, is rapidly becoming one of the most expensive, lethal, and burdening diseases of this century. In recent years, the new method used to treat nervous system diseases including AD is transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) with non-invasive and for regulating the flexibility of neural circuits operation and behaviors. The rationale of tES for AD neuromodulation is derived from research on animal and clinical trials. In the present paper, we review the current uses of the tES including transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, and transcranial pulsed electrical stimulation in rehabilitation for AD's core clinical symptom with cognitive dysfunctions, as well as the relevant data from AD animal models have also been discussed. Finally, the regarding applied challenges of tES in AD therapy have been referred for further improvement.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39730669,Association of plasma BDNF and MMP-9 levels with mild cognitive impairment: a matched case-control study.,"The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is on the rise globally, and everyone who develops AD eventually experiences mild cognitive impairment (MCI) first. Timely intervention at an early stage of the disease may mitigate disease progression. Recent studies indicate that BDNF and MMP-9 play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, this study aims to ascertain whether there are differences in plasma BDNF and MMP-9 levels between individuals with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and those with normal cognition, and to analyze the factors influencing mild cognitive impairment.This case-control study included 102 individuals with mild cognitive impairment and 102 controls, matched by age and sex. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, neuropsychological assessments, and clinical examinations. Plasma concentrations of BDNF and MMP-9 of the participants were quantified using ELISA. Subsequently, the factors influencing MCI were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The differences in plasma BDNF levels, MOCA total scores, and scores in various cognitive domains (including visuospatial and executive abilities, abstract thinking, attention, language, naming, and delayed memory) between the MCI and the control groups showed statistically significant (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that plasma BDNF levels and years of formal education were significantly negatively associated with MCI. This study indicates that plasma BDNF and years of formal education are protective factors influencing cognitive function.",Sci Rep,2024
39707531,Association of critically short telomeres with brain and blood markers of ageing and Alzheimer's disease in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Accumulation of critically short telomeres (CST) is implicated in decreased tissular regenerative capacity and increased susceptibility to degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Telomere shortening has also been associated with age-related brain changes. However, it remains unclear whether CST accumulation is directly associated with AD markers or instead amplifies age-related effects, potentially increasing susceptibility of developing AD in cognitively healthy older adults.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data of 129 community-dwelling cognitively healthy older adults from the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819), aged 65 years and older enrolled between 2016 and 2018, in France. Using linear regressions, we analyzed the relationship between an innovative marker of telomere shortening, the percentage of CST (%CST), structural, functional and molecular neuroimaging outcomes, and multiple blood-based biomarkers related to AD pathophysiology. The effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype (APOE4) was assessed on these relationships using interaction analysis.
RESULTS: A higher %CST was associated with lower global kurtosis fractional anisotropy (β = -.230; P = .010), particularly in frontal and temporal regions. A higher %CST was also related to higher plasma levels of Neurofilament light chain (β = .195; P = .020) and a lower subiculum volume (β = -.206; P = .020), although these associations did not meet the threshold for multiple comparisons. %CST was not associated with AD-related neuroimaging markers, including the AD-sensitive gray matter pattern (β = -.060; P = .441), glucose metabolism pattern (β = -.099; P = .372), brain perfusion pattern (β = -.106; P = .694) or hippocampus volume (β = -.106; P = .194). In APOE4 carriers, higher %CST was associated with lower subiculum (β = -.423; P = 0.003), DG (β = -.410; P = 0.018) and CA1 volumes (β = -.373; P = 0.024), even though associations with DG and CA1 volumes did not survive multiple comparison.
CONCLUSIONS: Although an increase in %CST does not appear to be directly linked to the pathophysiology of AD in cognitively healthy older adults, it could heighten the susceptibility of APOE4 carriers to develop AD plausibly due to greater vulnerability to age-related effects. However, longitudinal studies would be necessary to determine whether %CST influences the development and progression of AD later in life.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39944741,Late-onset unexplained seizures are associated with cognitive impairment and lower amygdala volumes.,"Late-onset epilepsy has been linked with accelerated cognitive decline and a higher risk of dementia. In this study, we sought to characterize the cognitive profile of participants with late-onset unexplained epilepsy and compare their MRI findings to healthy controls, to better understand underlying disease mechanisms. We recruited participants with at least one new-onset unexplained seizure at age 55 or later, without cortical lesions on MRI, within 5 years of the first seizure. We administered a neuropsychological battery to generate Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and composite scores for delayed verbal recall, processing speed and executive function. We held a consensus meeting to determine whether the participants fulfilled criteria for mild cognitive impairment. An MRI volumetric analysis of hippocampal, amygdalae, and white matter hyperintensity volume was performed and compared to 353 healthy controls from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. On late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants, we also obtained 24-h EEG recording. Seventy participants were recruited, mean age 71.0 ± 7.0 years, 49% female, 15.6 ± 3.0 years of education. Impaired cognition (z-score ≤ -1.5) for late-onset unexplained epilepsy included the following: 15.9% for Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite -5, 23.2% for delayed verbal recall, 15.6% for processing speed and 7.5% for executive function. Seventeen percent were found to have mild cognitive impairment. Late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants who were drug resistant were more likely to have cognitive impairment (50% vs. 9%). When controlling for age, sex and race, late-onset unexplained epilepsy group had lower left AV (%; β = -0.003, P = 0.0016), right AV (%) (β = -0.003, P = 0.01), and log-transformed WMV (mm<sup>3</sup>; β = -0.21, P = 0.03) compared with Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS); there were no differences in left or right HV between groups. EEG captured epileptiform abnormalities in 49% late-onset unexplained epilepsy participants, with a left temporal predominance (54%). In this single-site study of prospectively enrolled participants with late-onset unexplained epilepsy, we show that individuals with late-onset unexplained epilepsy exhibit cognitive impairments, mostly in verbal memory, and temporal dysfunction with left-sided predominance. Neuroimaging, when compared with healthy controls, shows lower amygdalae and white matter hyperintensity but not hippocampal volumes suggesting that the amygdalae is one of the earliest sites involved in the disease. The results also highlight the importance of seizure control given the association between mild cognitive impairment and drug-resistant epilepsy. Future studies extending these findings to Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and longitudinal follow-up will inform predictors of cognitive decline.",Brain Commun,2025
39932872,Machine learning reveals connections between preclinical type 2 diabetes subtypes and brain health.,"Previous research has established Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus as a significant risk factor for various disorders, adversely impacting human health. While evidence increasingly links type 2 diabetes to cognitive impairment and brain disorders, understanding the causal effects of its preclinical stage on brain health is yet to be fully known. This knowledge gap hinders advancements in screening and preventing neurological and psychiatric diseases. To address this gap, we employed a robust machine learning algorithm (Subtype and Stage Inference, SuStaIn) with cross-sectional clinical data from the UK Biobank (20,277 preclinical type 2 diabetes participants and 20,277 controls) to identify underlying subtypes and stages for preclinical type 2 diabetes. Our analysis revealed one subtype distinguished by elevated circulating leptin levels and decreased leptin receptor levels, coupled with increased body mass index, diminished lipid metabolism, and heightened susceptibility to psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorder, depression disorder, and bipolar disorder. Conversely, individuals in the second subtype manifested typical abnormalities in glucose metabolism, including rising glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, with observed correlations with neurodegenerative disorders. Over ten-year follow-up of these individuals revealed differential declines in brain health and significant clinical outcome disparities between subtypes. The first subtype exhibited a faster progression and higher risk for psychiatric conditions, while the second subtype was associated with more severe progression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and a faster progression to type 2 diabetes. Our findings highlight that monitoring and addressing the brain health needs of individuals in the preclinical stage of type 2 diabetes is imperative.",Brain,2025
39757625,Development of a Novel Mitochondrial Dysfunction-Related Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Model Using Bioinformatics and Machine Learning.,"UNLABELLED: <p> Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Despite the recognition of mitochondrial dysfunction as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of AD, the specific molecular mechanisms remain largely undefined.
METHOD: This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in AD by employing bioinformatics combined with machine learning methodologies. We performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) utilizing gene expression data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and isolated mitochondria-related genes through the MitoCarta3.0 database. By intersecting WGCNA-derived module genes with identified mitochondrial genes, we compiled a list of 60 mitochondrial dysfunction- related genes (MRGs) significantly enriched in pathways pertinent to mitochondrial function, such as the citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Employing machine learning techniques, including random forest and LASSO, along with the CytoHubba algorithm, we identified key genes with strong diagnostic potential, such as ACO2, CS, MRPS27, SDHA, SLC25A20, and SYNJ2BP, verified through ROC analysis. Furthermore, an interaction network involving miRNA-MRGs-transcription factors and a protein-drug interaction network revealed potential therapeutic compounds such as Congo red and kynurenic acid that target MRGs.
CONCLUSION: These findings delineate the intricate role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and highlight promising avenues for further exploration of biomarkers and therapeutic interventions in this devastating disease.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
40145305,Novel blood-based proteomic signatures across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to support early and accurate diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sensitive to molecular pathology and are predictive of outcome. We evaluated a novel multiplex proteomic method in people with diverse neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: Serum from people with Alzheimer's disease (N = 36), Lewy body dementia (N = 34), frontotemporal dementia (N = 36), and progressive supranuclear palsy (N = 36) and age-matched controls (N = 30) was analyzed with the nucleic acid linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) central nervous system panel (≈ 120 analytes) and inflammation panel (250 analytes). Biomarkers were compared across groups and included as predictors of survival.
RESULTS: The NULISA panels demonstrated high sensitivity and reliability for detecting multiple biomarkers across neurodegenerative disorders. There were condition-specific proteomic biomarkers, while neurofilament light chain, corticotropin-releasing hormone, CD276, and a data-driven inflammation pattern were significant transdiagnostic outcome predictors.
DISCUSSION: The sensitive NULISA multiplex approach supports differential diagnosis and target identification, with prognostically informative dementia-related biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: We tested the novel technology nucleic acid linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) in people with diverse neurodegenerative diseases, which demonstrated high sensitivity and reliability for detecting multiple biomarkers in serum samples. We compared the NULISA central nervous system serum results to single molecule array (Simoa) plasma assays for phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau231, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein, finding strong correlations. Increased levels of serum NfL were identified across all patient groups and most elevated in the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cohorts, while p-tau epitopes were the most significant markers in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia. Patients with FTD and PSP showed upregulation of many inflammation markers, compared to controls and patients with AD. We found condition-specific proteomic biomarkers, while NfL, corticotropin-releasing hormone, CD276, and data-driven immune signatures were significant transdiagnostic predictors of clinical outcomes (survival rates).",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39936326,Alzheimer's disease patients have smaller venous drainage system compared to cognitively healthy controls.,"INTRODUCTION: One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42). Decreased venous drainage may enhance Aβ42 accumulation. We aimed to compare venous cross-sectional area (CSA) of AD patients to cognitively healthy controls.
METHODS: All patients underwent neurocognitive evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging, including time-of-flight sequence. Venous CSA was measured at the jugular foramen level.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine AD/mild cognitive impairment patients and 20 cognitively healthy controls were included. Total venous CSA was smaller in the cognitively impaired group (mean CSA 139.77 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD: 32.22] vs 166.55 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD: 33.1], p = 0.004]. When divided, both internal jugular and non-jugular systems were smaller within cognitively impaired patients; statistical significance was achieved only for the non-jugular system (mean CSA 41.21 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD: 21.52] vs 54.5 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD: 27.31], p = 0.045).
DISCUSSION: There is an association between smaller venous systems and cognitive impairment, most prominently in the non-jugular system. Venous narrowing may cause impaired venous drainage, leading to an accumulation of Aβ42.
HIGHLIGHTS: The non-jugular venous system, including the vertebral plexus and pterygopalatine plexus, plays an important role in cerebral drainage. The total venous CSA is significantly smaller in cognitively impaired patients compared to healthy controls. Reduced venous drainage may contribute to the accumulation of Aβ and other waste products and potentially plays a role in AD pathology.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40085351,Systematic Identification of Mitochondrial Signatures in Alzheimer's Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a shared feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), linked through overlapping pathways of hypoxia and immune dysregulation. Our study integrated transcriptomic and genetic analyses to uncover mitochondria-related mechanisms underlying these diseases. By analyzing multiple AD and IBD datasets through differential expression gene (DEG) analyses, biological pathway enrichment, and co-expression module construction, we identified hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as a central risk factor for both conditions. Key findings revealed several mitochondrial-related genes shared between AD and IBD, including BCL6, PFKFB3, NDUFS3, and COX5B, which serve as critical regulators bridging mitochondrial and immune pathways. Drug enrichment analyses using Drug Signatures Database (DsigDB) and the Connectivity Map (cMAP) identified promising therapeutic candidates, including decitabine, DMOG, and estradiol, targeting shared regulators such as BCL6, PFKFB3, MAFF, and TGFBI. These drugs demonstrated potential to modulate mitochondrial autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), pathways enriched in the constructed interaction network with BCL6 and PFKFB3 as central nodes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis further identified MAP1LC3A as significantly associated with increased risk for both AD and IBD, while NME1 emerged as strongly protective, suggesting their roles as therapeutic targets. Our findings underscore hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as a unifying mechanism in AD and IBD, mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). By identifying key mitochondria-associated genes and pathways, this study highlights innovative therapeutic targets and contributes to a deeper understanding of the gut-brain interplay in neurodegeneration and chronic inflammation. These insights pave the way for precision medicine strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and IBD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39985478,Role of tau versus TDP-43 pathology on medial temporal lobe atrophy in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging is an important biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While hippocampal atrophy was thought to result from tau tangles in AD, different neuropathologies can lead to hippocampal atrophy, especially TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. In this narrative review, we evaluate existing studies on the relative contribution of tau and TDP-43 pathology to medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. We report a clear association of both tau and TDP-43 neuropathology with MTL atrophy, even after correcting for other neuropathologies. Next, we discuss a potential synergism between tau and TDP-43 and the relative timing of the effects of both neuropathologies. Finally, avenues for future research will be discussed. A better understanding of the interplay between tau and TDP-43 neuropathologies and their effect on atrophy will help with the development of more specific biomarkers for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and pinpointing of the optimal timing for testing anti-tau and anti-TDP-43 treatments in trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Both tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology contribute to medial temporal lobe atrophy. There is a positive association between tau and TDP-43 and potentially a synergism. It is unclear if tau and TDP-43 have an additive or synergistic effect on atrophy. The relative timing of the tau and TDP-43 effects on atrophy remains unclear. Clarifying the interplay between tau and TDP-43 will help improve magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40048429,Astrocyte glypican 5 regulates synapse maturation and stabilization.,"The maturation and stabilization of appropriate synaptic connections is a vital step in neural circuit development; however, the molecular signals underlying these processes are not fully understood. We show that astrocytes, through production of glypican 5 (GPC5), are required for maturation and refinement of synapses in the mouse cortex during the critical period. In the absence of astrocyte GPC5, thalamocortical synapses show structural immaturity, including smaller presynaptic terminals, decreased postsynaptic density area, and presence of more postsynaptic partners at multisynaptic connections. This structural immaturity is accompanied by a delay in developmental incorporation of GLUA2-containing AMPARs at intracortical synapses. The functional impact of this is that mice lacking astrocyte GPC5 exhibit increased levels of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood. This demonstrates that astrocyte GPC5 is necessary for maturation and stabilization of synaptic connections, which has implications for disorders with altered synaptic function where GPC5 levels are altered, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",Cell Rep,2025
39804791,Higher Intron Retention Levels in Female Alzheimer's Brains May Be Linked to Disease Prevalence.,"Multimodal study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) showed AD-related aberrant intron retention (IR) and proteomic changes not observed at the RNA level. However, the role of sex and how IR may impact the proteome are unclear. Analysis of DLPFC transcriptome showed a clear sex-biased pattern where female AD had 1645 elevated IR events compared to 80 in male AD DLPFC. Increased IR is correlated with lower mRNA levels, suggestive of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Two hundred thirty-three mRNAs with elevated IR in females were curated AD genes enriched for ubiquitin-like protein ligase and Tau protein binding. Increased IR genes in combined sex and female AD cohorts showed significant changes in their protein expression patterns with 11%-24% of them differential expressed proteins (DEP), alluding to the regulation of AD proteome by IR independent of RNA level. Upregulated DEPs in male AD were linked to RNA splicing that may prevent aberrant IR, whereas in female AD, they overlapped significantly more with the MAPK/metabolism module associated with cognitive decline. IR genes appeared to be significantly downregulated in specific female AD inhibitory and excitatory neurons compared to control. Differentially retained introns in female AD have elevated H3K27ac marks, strong CTCF binding at their flanking exons, and enriched for PABPC1 motif. Given that H3K27ac is repressive over gene bodies in aged brain and CTCF impedes transcription elongation, their binding patterns can delay co-transcriptional recruitment of spliceosome to cause IR, which may in turn contribute to different trajectories of AD pathology in women.",Aging Cell,2025
40064964,Exploring a patient-specific in vitro pipeline for stratification and drug response prediction of microglia-based therapeutics.,"The scarcity of effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for predicting disease onset and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge. Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.",Sci Rep,2025
39715923,"ADNP is essential for sex-dependent hippocampal neurogenesis, through male unfolded protein response and female mitochondrial gene regulation.","Essential for brain formation and protective against tauopathy, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is critical for neurogenesis and cognitive functions, while regulating steroid hormone biogenesis. As such, de novo mutations in ADNP lead to syndromic autism and somatic ADNP mutations parallel Alzheimer's disease progression. Furthermore, clinical trials with the ADNP fragment NAP (the investigational drug davunetide) showed efficacy in women suffering from the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy and differentially boosted memory in men (spatial) and women (verbal), exhibiting prodromal Alzheimer's disease. While autism is more prevalent in boys and Alzheimer's disease in women, both involve impaired neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether ADNP sex-dependently regulates neurogenesis. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker of neurogenesis, we identified two-fold higher labeling in the hippocampal sub-ventricular zone of ADNP-intact male versus female mice. Adnp haplo-insufficient (Adnp<sup>+/-</sup>) mice or mice CRSIPR/Cas9-edited to present the most prevalent neurodevelopmental ADNP syndrome mutation, p.Tyr718* (Tyr) showed dramatic reductions in male BrdU incorporation, resulting in mutated females presenting higher labeling than males. Treatment with NAP compensated for the male reduction of BrdU labeling. Mechanistically, hippocampal RNAseq revealed male-specific Tyr down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response genes critical for sex-dependent organogenesis. Newly discovered mitochondrial accessibility of ADNP was inhibited by the Tyr718* mutation further revealing female-specific Tyr downregulation of mitochondrial ATP6. NAP moderated much of the differential expression caused by p.Tyr718*, accompanied by the down-regulation of neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes. Thus, ADNP is a key regulator of sex-dependent neurogenesis that acts by controlling canonical pathways, with NAP compensating for fundamental ADNP deficiencies, striding toward clinical development targeting the ADNP syndrome and related neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative diseases.",Mol Psychiatry,2024
39907307,Aberrant accumulation of phosphorylated BRCA1 in brainstem-type and cortical-type Lewy bodies in Lewy body disease.,"BRCA1 plays important roles in several biological events during the DNA damage response (DDR). We aimed to determine whether cytoplasmic accumulation of BRCA1 or its phosphorylated form, pBRCA1, is specific to cytoplasmic inclusions in tauopathies, or if it also occurs in α-synuclein-positive inclusions in Lewy body disease (LBD). Using brain tissue from pure LBD, LBD with Alzheimer disease (AD) co-pathology (LBD-AD), and control cases, the immunohistochemical distributions of BRCA1, pBRCA1, its binding partner BARD1, and 53BP1 were examined. The results showed that pBRCA1 (Ser1423) and BARD1 accumulated in brainstem-type Lewy bodies (LBs), whereas only pBRCA1 (Ser1423) was present in cortical-type LBs. There was no significant difference in the frequency of pBRCA1 (Ser1423)-positive LBs between the pure LBD and LBD-AD cases. pBRCA1 (Ser1423) was minimally detected in neuronal nuclei in controls and was absent in neuronal nuclei in LBD cases. In control and LBD cases, 53BP1-immunoreactive deposits were present in the neuronal nuclei. Thus, DDR dysfunction due to cytoplasmic sequestration of pBRCA1 (Ser1423) may play a role in LBD pathogenesis. Additionally, the selective accumulation of BARD1 in brainstem-type LBs, but not cortical-type LBs, points to distinct mechanisms in the formation of these inclusion types, offering further insights into LBD pathology.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2025
40149790,Brain Ischemia in Alzheimer's Disease May Partly Counteract the Disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"BACKGROUND: In normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) there is blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which should increase the CSF formation rate (CSF<sub>fr)</sub> and, therefore, also increase the intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the ICP is normal in NPH. A lumped parameter study was performed to look at the interrelation between the ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the degree of BBB disruption in NPH. The model suggested that the CSF<sub>fr</sub> could be reduced in this condition if the BBB disruption was moderated by a reduction in the capillary transmural pressure (TMP) secondary to arteriolar constriction and a reduced CBF. In early Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is BBB disruption, reduced ICP, and global ischemia. This raises the possibility that the same physiology may occur in AD as occurs in NPH.
METHODS: A lumped parameter model previously used to describe the hydrodynamics of NPH was modified to investigate the effects of changes in CSF pressure and blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
RESULTS: The model indicates that the average capillary TMP is normal in MCI, but decreases as AD progresses. Removing CSF in AD patients during a tap test initially increases the capillary TMP. The brain in AD responds to a tap test by increasing its level of ischemia, and this reduces the capillary TMP.
CONCLUSIONS: A hypothesis is put forward that the BBB disruption in AD is partially mitigated by the brain making itself ischemic. Modelling gives support to this hypothesis. The model can suggest a cause for the development of ischemic neuronal loss and amyloid accumulation secondary to glymphatic flow disruption as AD progresses.",Brain Sci,2025
39716111,A fatal familial insomnia patient initially misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease and a type of prion diseases. We report a case of fatal familial insomnia (FFI) in a 52-year-old man who was initially misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with persistent insomnia as the initial symptom, accompanied by cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and disorders of voluntary movement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a decrease in Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> levels and an increase in total tau protein. Cranial imaging demonstrated bilateral hippocampal atrophy, while long-term video electroencephalography indicated focal abnormalities. The patient's prion protein gene was D178N/129MM type, confirmed the diagnosis of FFI.
CONCLUSIONS: The key characteristics of FFI include insomnia and rapidly progressive dementia, its differential diagnosis with AD has been extensively discussed in clinical practice. This is the first report of FFI concerning Aβ and tau protein, raises the awareness that the ratio of p-tau/t-tau in cerebrospinal fluid can provide valuable diagnostic clues for FFI.",BMC Neurol,2024
40194068,Explainable AI Models for Detection of Dementia with Lewy Body: A Scoping Review (P5-3.003).,"OBJECTIVE: This review aims to investigate the current evidence regarding the detection of LBD using XAI.
BACKGROUND: Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) is a combination of cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuations in attention. These heterogeneities of symptoms often complicate the diagnostic process, making early detection and accurate classification critical for effective management. Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a promising tool that enhances AI models' interpretability while preserving their predictive performance.
DESIGN/METHODS: A comprehensive search of four databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library to get relevant studies previously published till September 2024. All studies have been included to investigate the role of XAI in the detection of LBD including different parameters regarding preprocessing, model algorithms, model inputs, and performance.
RESULTS: a review of three studies including over 700 patients showed that the MUQUBIA SVM model and multimodal MRI data showed the highest accuracy, 87.5%, regarding the differentiation of dementia types. AI model based on Random Forest and RIPPER algorithm over clinical data distinguishes LBD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with 86% accuracy. Multi-class SVM with FDG PET data, yielding 78% and 86% accuracy for pattern-based and ROI-based classifiers, respectively. While the models' objectives and datasets differ, each model has advantages and drawbacks. The model chosen is determined by clinical aims such as multi-class categorization, LBD-AD differentiation, or discriminating between several dementias.
CONCLUSIONS: Using XAI approaches like SHAP improved the models' interpretability and accuracy in differentiating LBD from other types of dementia. Despite the potential benefits, integrating XAI into clinical practice for LBD involves several barriers, including the necessity for validation and ethical concerns.

40121258,Effect of PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation on the seeding activity of C-terminal Tau fragments.,"Tau proteins as neurofibrillary tangles are one of the molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and play a central role in tauopathies, a group of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The filament cores from diverse tauopathies share a common region of tau consisting of the R3-R4 microtubule-binding repeats and part of the C-terminal domain, but present a structural polymorphism. Unlike the fibril structure, the PTM signature of tau found in neuronal inclusions, more particularly hyperphosphorylation, is variable between individuals with the same tauopathy, giving rise to diverse strains with different seeding properties that could modulate the aggressiveness of tau pathology. Here, we investigate the conformation, function and seeding activity of two tau fragments and their GSK3β-phosphorylated variants. The R2Ct and R3Ct fragments encompass the aggregation-prone region of tau starting at the R2 and R3 repeats, respectively, and the full C-terminal domain including the PHF-1 epitope (S396, S400, S404), which undergoes a triple phosphorylation upon GSK3β activity. We found that the R3Ct fragment shows both a greater loss of function and pathological activity in seeding of aggregation than the R2Ct fragment which imposes a cross-seeding barrier. PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation induces a local conformational change with a propensity to adopt a β-sheet conformation in the region spanning residues 392-402, and exacerbates the seeding ability of fragments to induce aggregation by overcoming a cross-seeding barrier between tau variants.",Sci Rep,2025
39791370,Association of small vessel disease progression with longitudinal cognitive decline across mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the leading cause of vascular dementia. However, it is unclear whether the individual SVD or global SVD progression correlates with cognitive decline across mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of small vessel disease progression with longitudinal cognitive decline across MCI.
METHODS: We included 432 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, with 151 participants in the cognitively normal (CN) group and 281 participants in the MCI group. We evaluated magnetic resonance imaging-based SVD markers in both CN and MCI groups and explored their associations with 12-and 24-month cognitive decline using linear mixing effect (LME) models.
RESULTS: In the CN group, cerebral microbleed (CMB) progression was associated with the decline in language function (p < 0.05), and deep white matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression was associated with a decline in memory function (p < 0.05). In the MCI group, CMB progression was associated with a decline in memory function (p < 0.05) and lacunes progression was associated with executive function (p < 0.05), whereas the progression of global SVD score was not related to longitudinal cognitive function.
CONCLUSIONS: The progression of CMB and WMH had an impact on cognitive decline in both CN and MCI groups, and lacunes progression only had an association with cognitive decline in the MCI group. Our study suggested that individual SVD markers may have a higher predictive value in longitudinal cognition compared with global SVD burden.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40011070,A Shift Toward Supercritical Brain Dynamics Predicts Alzheimer's Disease Progression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with continuum of disease progression of increasing severity from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and lastly to AD. The transition from MCI to AD has been linked to brain hypersynchronization, but the underlying mechanisms leading to this are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that excessive excitation in AD disease progression would shift brain dynamics toward supercriticality across an extended regime of critical-like dynamics. In this framework, healthy brain activity during aging preserves operation at near the critical phase transition at balanced excitation-inhibition (E/I). To test this hypothesis, we used source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data from a cross-sectional cohort (N = 343) of individuals with SCD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC) as well as from a longitudinal cohort (N = 45) of MCI patients. We then assessed brain criticality by quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) and functional EI (fE/I) of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were attenuated in SCD in spectrally and anatomically constrained regions while this breakdown was progressively more widespread in MC. In parallel, fE/I was increased in the MCI but not in the SC cohort. Both observations also predicted the disease progression in the longitudinal cohort. Finally, using machine learning trained on functional (LRTCs, fE/I) and structural (MTL volumes) features, we show that LRTCs and f/EI are the most informative features for accurate classification of individuals with SCD while structural changes accurate classify the individuals with MCI. These findings establish that a shift toward supercritical brain dynamics reflects early AD disease progression.",J Neurosci,2025
40002775,Identification of Lipophagy-Related Gene Signature for Diagnosis and Risk Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background: Recent research indicates that lipid metabolism and autophagy play crucial roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigating the relationship between AD diagnosis and gene expression related to lipid metabolism, autophagy, and lipophagy may improve early diagnosis and the identification of therapeutic targets. Methods: Transcription datasets from AD patients were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Genes associated with lipid metabolism, autophagy, and lipophagy were sourced from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) database and the Human Autophagy Database (HADb). Lipophagy-related hub genes were identified using a combination of Limma analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning techniques. Based on these hub genes, we developed an AD risk prediction nomogram and validated its diagnostic accuracy using three external validation datasets. Additionally, the expression levels of the hub genes were assessed through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: Our analysis identified three hub genes-ACBD5, GABARAPL1, and HSPA8-as being associated with AD progression. The nomogram constructed from these hub genes achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.894 for AD risk prediction, with all validation sets yielding AUC values greater than 0.8, indicating excellent diagnostic efficacy. qRT-PCR results further corroborated the associations between these hub genes and AD development. Conclusions: This study identified and validated three lipophagy-related hub genes and developed a reliable diagnostic model, offering insights into the pathology of AD and facilitating the diagnosis of AD patients.",Biomedicines,2025
39806490,CEST imaging combined with <sup>1</sup>H-MRS reveal the neuroprotective effects of riluzole by improving neurotransmitter imbalances in Alzheimer's disease mice.,"BACKGROUND: The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Riluzole is a Glu modulator originally approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that has shown potential neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether riluzole can improve Glu and GABA homeostasis in AD brain and its related mechanism of action remain unknown. This study utilized chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging combined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to monitor the dynamic changes of Glu and GABA in riluzole-treated AD mice, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of riluzole in AD treatment.
METHODS: GluCEST, GABACEST and <sup>1</sup>H-MRS were used to longitudinally monitor Glu and GABA levels in 3xTg AD mice treated with riluzole (12.5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 20 weeks. Magnetic resonance measurements were performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 20 weeks post-treatment. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) at baseline, 10, and 20 weeks. At the study endpoint, immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and Western blot were used to evaluate the brain pathology, neuronal survival, and protein expression.
RESULTS: GluCEST, GABACEST and <sup>1</sup>H-MRS consistently revealed higher levels of Glu and GABA in the brain of riluzole-treated AD mice compared to untreated controls, which were associated with improvements in spatial learning and memory. The cognitive improvements significantly correlated with the increased GluCEST signals and Glu levels. Immunohistochemistry and Nissl staining demonstrated that riluzole treatment reduced amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, GFAP-positive astrocyte activation, and prevented neuronal loss. Moreover, riluzole upregulated the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67), and glutamine synthetase (GS), suggesting enhanced neurotransmitter metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: CEST imaging combined with <sup>1</sup>H-MRS demonstrated the effectiveness of riluzole in modulating Glu- and GABA-related changes and improving cognitive function in 3xTg AD mice, potentially through regulating key proteins involved in neurotransmitter metabolism. These findings suggest riluzole as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease and highlight the utility of multimodal MR imaging in monitoring treatment response and exploring disease mechanisms.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40172923,A three-week Ketogenic Diet increases Global Cerebral Blood Flow and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.,"PURPOSE: The beneficial effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) on neurodegenerative conditions such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly acknowledged, with potential implications for the general population as well. Thus, our study aimed to explore the effect of a KD on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that a KD would increase CBF and BDNF, thereby presenting itself as an approach to prevent cognitive decline.
METHODS: In total, 11 cognitively healthy individuals with overweight participated in a randomized, crossover trial consisting of two three-week interventions: 1) a KD and 2) a standard diet. Each diet period concluded with a positron emission tomography (PET) study day, accompanied by a separate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Blood samples were collected prior to the PET scan to measure β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) and BDNF levels. CBF was assessed using a [15O]H2O PET scan co-registered with an MRI scan.
RESULTS: A KD led to increased basal plasma β-OHB levels compared to the SDD (647 (418-724) vs. 50 (50-60) μmol/l, p<0.05), increased CBF by 22% (p=0.02), and elevated BDNF levels by 47% (p=0.04). Moreover, a correlation was observed between β-OHB levels and CBF measurements across the two diets (R2=0.54, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Implementing a KD improved CBF and raised BDNF levels in cognitively healthy individuals, indicating that a KD should be assessed for as a potential treatment for conditions associated with reduced CBF.",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,2025
40105475,Identifying microglia-derived NFKBIA as a potential contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) place considerable health burden on affected individuals and significant economic burden on society.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the shared cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD and AMD.MethodsThe investigation in this study is conducted via single-cell and bulk tissue transcriptomic analysis. Transcriptomic datasets of AD and AMD were obtained from the GEO database. The shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in control and AD- and AMD-affected samples were identified. Functional enrichment analysis for DEGs was subsequently performed. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these DEGs was established via the STRING database and hub genes of this network were identified by Cytoscape software. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed using Seurat R package to explore their expression in different cell types.ResultsDifferential analysis identified 127 shared DEGs of the two diseases, including 71 upregulated and 56 downregulated genes. Upregulated DEGs were enriched in inflammation, gliogenesis, cell apoptosis, and response to bacterial and viral infection and downregulated DEGs were enriched in mitochondrial function and energy production. PPI network and Cytoscape determined 10 hub genes, of which the NFKBIA gene was associated with the severity of both AD and AMD. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that NFKBIA was highly expressed in microglia from disease-affected tissues.ConclusionsThe findings indicated that microglia with high NFKBIA expression were important contributors to the progression of both AD and AMD. Microglia-derived NFKBIA might serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD and AMD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40085717,PseudoSorter: A self-supervised spike sorting approach applied to reveal Tau-induced reductions in neuronal activity.,"Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) permit recordings with high electrode counts, thus generating complex datasets that would benefit from precise neuronal spike sorting for meaningful data extraction. Nevertheless, conventional spike sorting methods face limitations in recognizing diverse spike shapes. Here, we introduce PseudoSorter, which uses self-supervised learning techniques, a density-based pseudolabeling strategy, and an iterative fine-tuning process to enhance spike sorting accuracy. Through benchmarking, we demonstrate the superior performance of PseudoSorter compared to other spike sorting algorithms before applying PseudoSorter on MEA recordings from hippocampal neurons exposed to subneuronal concentrations of monomeric Tau as a model for Alzheimer's disease. Our results unveil that Tau diminishes the firing rate of a subset of neurons, which complement our findings observed using conventional electrophysiology analysis, and demonstrate that PseudoSorter's high accuracy and throughput make it a valuable tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms, as well as for therapeutic drug screening.",Sci Adv,2025
40194047,"Evaluation of Plasma pTau217 plus Abeta42/40, and pTau217/Abeta42 Ratio as Confirmatory Tests for Amyloid Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (N4.003).","OBJECTIVE: Multiple analytical approaches, based on plasma pTau217 and Aβ42/40 measurements, are evaluated using discriminatory performance for amyloid PET with the goal of developing a confirmatory test for Aβ pathology demonstrating ≥90% sensitivity and specificity.
BACKGROUND: Recent advances in automated immunoassays have enabled sensitive detection of AD neuropathological markers Aβ42/40 and pTau217 in blood plasma, however, most exhibit <90% sensitivity and specificity with the application of a single cutoff. Further characterization of increased diagnostic accuracy in pre- and symptomatic AD subjects is needed.
DESIGN/METHODS: One hundred-ninety-seven participants from the AIBL cohort were selected representing a cross-sectional AD continuum population: cognitive unimpaired (CU) Aβ- (n=75), CU Aβ+ (n=48), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Aβ+ (n=26), and AD Aβ+ (n=48) with amyloid PET positivity prevalence of 62.5%. EDTA-plasma samples were analyzed with Lumipulse pTau217 and Aβ42/40 assays. Multivariable models and ratios combining biomarkers, and +/- adjustment for demographic variables, were tested vs. single measurements for ROC-AUC concordance with amyloid PET, applying single vs. dual cutoff approaches.
RESULTS: Models containing pTau217 and Aβ42 or Aβ42/40 ratio, adjusted for demographic variables, provided improved concordance with amyloid PET over pTau217 alone in the entire group (AUC=0.965 vs 0.941). pTau217/Aβ42 ratio results in AUC=0.961 (unadjusted, p = 0.01 vs pTau217 alone) vs 0.97 (adjusted). Application of a single pTau217/Aβ42 cutoff results in 93% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 93% accuracy; an improvement over pTau217 alone (95% sensitivity, 83% specificity, 90% accuracy). Application of dual pTau217/Aβ42 cutoffs set to achieve 95% sensitivity and specificity results in 9% of participants in an intermediate category.
CONCLUSIONS: The improved performance of the pTau217/Aβ42 ratio relative to pTau217 alone, comparable to more complex multivariable models, meets a recommended performance of a confirmatory AD blood biomarker test of ≥90% sensitivity and specificity.

40134262,"Effect of long-term care and pandemic wave on relative risk of COVID-19-related infection, hospitalization and mortality in people living with dementia: A population-based cohort study.","BackgroundPeople living with dementia (PLWD) are vulnerable to serious COVID-19 illness and death but the contribution of various factors including long-term care (LTC), pandemic wave, hospitalization, comorbidities, and underlying neurological health remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and mortality (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) in PLWD compared to those without dementia, by living circumstance and pandemic wave, while controlling for additional risk factors.MethodsA cohort of people 65 and up with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, was propensity score matched to a control cohort using linked population-level health records. Relative risk of outcomes was estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards modelling. The modifying effects of LTC residence and pandemic wave on all outcomes, and of COVID-19-related hospitalization on COVID-19 mortality were investigated.ResultsCompared to controls without dementia, PLWD had higher risk of infection and COVID-19 mortality whether they lived in LTC or not. For PLWD in LTC, relative risk was often reduced or not significantly different when stratified by wave but remained higher for PLWD not in LTC (32-93%). In LTC, likelihood of hospitalization was 53-64% lower for PLWD compared to those without dementia. PLWD not hospitalized for COVID-19 had higher COVID-19 mortality than non-hospitalized, non-dementia controls both in and not in LTC (32% and 477%, respectively).ConclusionsPLWD repeatedly had higher risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality, but risk varied with changing pandemic circumstances and living environment. Higher mortality may have been associated with reduced hospital transfers, complex care needs and neurological health.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39777990,The Taiwan-ADNI workflow toward integrating plasma p-tau217 into prediction models for the risk of Alzheimer's disease and tau burden.,"INTRODUCTION: We integrated plasma biomarkers from the Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and propose a workflow to identify individuals showing amyloid-positive positron emission tomography (PET) with low/intermediate tau burden based on [18F]Florzolotau PET-based quantification.
METHODS: We assessed 361 participants across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD continuum and measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels at two medical centers. We evaluated the diagnostic potential of these biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among all plasma biomarkers, p-tau217 had the highest consistency with amyloid PET results (area under the curve = 0.94), and a cutoff value could have reduced the number of confirmatory amyloid PET scans by 57.5%. In amyloid PET-positive cases intending to use anti-amyloid therapy, p-tau217 level, along with clinical parameters, had the highest predictive ability for low/intermediate tau burden.
DISCUSSION: A two-step workflow based on p-tau217 and confirmatory amyloid PET could accurately classify AD patients showing low/intermediate tau burden.
HIGHLIGHTS: The emergence of anti-amyloid therapy increases the need to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of plasma biomarkers, especially phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), can help in the diagnosis of AD. P-tau217 is a better predictor of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) positivity than other core biomarkers. In amyloid PET-positive individuals, p-tau217 can predict tau burden. We propose a two-step workflow to identify AD cases suitable for treatment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39773090,Association of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 with Alzheimer's disease: A new therapeutic prospect.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common disease associated with cognitive dysfunction, which is closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical manifestations, pathological changes and prevention. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) can lower blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion. Besides, it can affect cognitive function through the neuroprotective effect of DPP-4 substrates, such as glucose-dependent insulin peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1, the proteolytic effect on amyloid-β and the protective effect on neuronal structure. This review discusses the relationship between cognitive impairment in T2DM and in AD, summarizes the effect of DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) on improving cognitive impairment in these two diseases based on the current studies. Given the lack of clinical randomized trials that evaluate the effect of DPP-4i on AD, this review is expected to provide preclinical evidence for DPP-4i as a potential therapy for the treatment and prevention of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40046779,Adolescent binge alcohol exposure accelerates Alzheimer's disease-associated basal forebrain neuropathology through proinflammatory HMGB1 signaling.,"Human studies suggest that heavy alcohol use may be an etiological factor contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Both alcohol use disorder (AUD) and AD share common underlying neuropathology, including proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-mediated neuroimmune signaling and basal forebrain cholinergic neuron degeneration. Adolescent onset of binge drinking represents a significant risk factor for later development of an AUD, and accumulating evidence suggests that adolescent initiation of heavy alcohol use induces HMGB1 signaling and causes degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system that persists into adulthood. However, it is unknown whether adolescent binge drinking confers increased risk for later development of AD-associated neuropathology through persistent induction of proinflammatory HMGB1 neuroimmune signaling. To investigate this question, we first (Experiment 1) assessed AD-associated neuropathology in the post-mortem human basal forebrain of individuals with AUD and an adolescent age of drinking onset relative to age-matched moderate drinking controls (CONs). In Experiment 2, we treated non-transgenic and 5xFAD male and female mice, which overexpress both mutant human APP and PS1, with adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5.0 g/kg, i.g. 2-days on/2-days off; postnatal day [P]30 - P55), and assessed AD-associated neuropathology in the adult (P100) basal forebrain. In Experiment 3, 5xFAD female mice received AIE treatment followed by glycyrrhizic acid (150 mg/L), an HMGB1 inhibitor, in drinking water from P56 to P100, and basal forebrain tissue was collected on P100 for assessment of AD-associated neuropathology. In the post-mortem human AUD basal forebrain (Experiment 1), we report upregulation of Hmgb1 and the HMGB1 receptors Rage and Tlr4 as well as microglial activation and increased intraneuronal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> accumulation in association with reduced cholinergic neuron marker expression (ChAT). In the 5xFAD mouse model (Experiment 2), AIE accelerated AD-associated induction of Hmgb1 proinflammatory neuroimmune genes, microglial activation, and reductions of ChAT+ basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the adult female, but not male, basal forebrain. In Experiment 3, post-AIE treatment with glycyrrhizic acid rescued the AIE-induced acceleration of AD-associated increases in proinflammatory HMGB1 neuroimmune signaling, microglial activation, and persistent reductions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in adult 5xFAD female mice. Together, these findings suggest that adolescent binge ethanol exposure may represent an underappreciated etiological factor contributing to onset of AD-associated neuropathology in adulthood through HMGB1- mediated neuroimmune signaling.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39762277,Alzheimer's disease recognition using graph neural network by leveraging image-text similarity from vision language model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition, notably impacts cognitive functions and daily activity. One method of detecting dementia involves a task where participants describe a given picture, and extensive research has been conducted using the participants' speech and transcribed text. However, very few studies have explored the modality of the image itself. In this work, we propose a method that predicts dementia automatically by representing the relationship between images and texts as a graph. First, we transcribe the participants' speech into text using an automatic speech recognition system. Then, we employ a vision language model to represent the relationship between the parts of the image and the corresponding descriptive sentences as a bipartite graph. Finally, we use a graph convolutional network (GCN), considering each subject as an individual graph, to classify AD patients through a graph-level classification task. In experiments conducted on the ADReSSo Challenge datasets, our model surpassed the existing state-of-the-art performance by achieving an accuracy of 88.73%. Additionally, ablation studies that removed the relationship between images and texts demonstrated the critical role of graphs in improving performance. Furthermore, by utilizing the sentence representations learned through the GCN, we identified the sentences and keywords critical for AD classification.",Sci Rep,2025
40064874,Berberine-inspired ionizable lipid for self-structure stabilization and brain targeting delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.,"Lipid nanoparticles have shown success in targeting major organs such as the liver, spleen, and lungs, but crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge. Effective brain-targeted delivery systems are essential for advancing gene therapy for neurological diseases but remain limited by low transport efficiency and poor nucleic acid stability. Here, we report a library of ionizable lipids based on the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of protoberberine alkaloids, designed to improve BBB penetration via dopamine D3 receptor-mediated endocytosis. These nanoparticles offer three key advantages: enhanced brain uptake, improved nucleic acid stability through poly(A) self-assembly, and minimal immunogenicity with inherent neuroprotective properties. In murine models, they demonstrate therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease, glioma, and cryptococcal meningitis. This berberine-inspired delivery system integrates precise receptor targeting with nucleic acid stabilization, offering a promising platform for brain-targeted therapeutics.",Nat Commun,2025
40138617,The Social Vulnerability Index and Incidence of Alzheimer Disease in a Population-Based Sample of Older Adults.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The primary study objective was to examine the association between Social Vulnerability index (SVI) and risk of incident Alzheimer disease (AD) and rate of cognitive decline.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a population-based cohort study. Participants were recruited through door visits, were at least 65 years of age at enrollment, and lived in one of 4 Chicago communities representing 24 US census tracts. The association of SVI with clinically diagnosed incident AD was examined using a logistic regression model and global cognitive decline using a linear mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 6,781 participants were in this study, with a mean age of 72 years, representing over 60% Black participants and over 60% female participants, and with a mean of 12 years of education. Over 90% of Black participants were in tracts above 50% or higher SVI, and approximately 87% of White participants were in tracts with SVI 50% or less. Participants in tracts with SVI above 50th to 75th percentiles had OR = 2.23 (95% CI 1.23-4.05) for clinical AD, and participants in tracts greater than the 75th percentile had OR = 2.04 (95% CI 1.03-4.04). Participants in more vulnerable tracts had greater incident AD risk than participants in less vulnerable tracts. The annual rate of global cognitive decline was 0.055 SD units (SDU) for participants below the 25th SVI percentile. The annual rate of global cognitive decline was faster by 0.010 SDU (approximately 18% faster, p = 0.025) in those above the 50th-75th percentile and by 0.014 SDU (approximately 25% faster, p = 0.005) in participants above the 75th percentile than in participants below the 25th SVI percentile.
DISCUSSION: Most Black participants who lived in areas with higher SVI that had over twice the risk of incident AD than most White participants who lived in areas with lower SVI, showing a higher social burden in Black older adults. There was no statistically significant race difference in incident AD after adjusting for SVI. SVI should be accounted for when examining race differences in AD.",Neurology,2025
40193808,Role of Combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neuroimaging in Detecting Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB): A Scoping Review (P3-5.027).,"OBJECTIVE: This scoping review systematically maps the literature on AI models in neuroimaging for detecting and differentiating DLB from other neurodegenerative conditions. It evaluates diverse AI approaches and imaging modalities, identifies trends and methodological issues, and provides recommendations to address limitations and improve diagnostic accuracy.
BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. Early and accurate diagnosis of DLB is crucial but challenging due to its overlap with other dementias, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and neuroimaging offer promising avenues for enhancing diagnostic precision.
DESIGN/METHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. Studies were included if they involved human subjects diagnosed with DLB and utilized AI models applied to neuroimaging data. Data extraction and analysis focused on study characteristics, AI model specifics, neuroimaging techniques, and diagnostic performance metrics.
RESULTS: Out of 124 identified studies, 22 met the inclusion criteria. For DLB detection, models like Convolutional Neural Networks achieved sensitivities of 86% and specificities of 100%. Differentiation from other dementias has improved, with models showing up to 94% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity for distinguishing DLB from AD and Parkinsonian syndromes. However, limitations include reliance on specific datasets, small sample sizes, and the use of synthetic data, which impact generalizability and diagnostic accuracy. Future research should focus on expanding datasets to include diverse populations, integrating additional clinical data, and validating AI models with independent datasets. Addressing these limitations will be crucial for enhancing diagnostic precision, integrating AI into clinical workflows, and advancing personalized treatment strategies for DLB.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of AI and neuroimaging presents significant potential for improving DLB diagnosis and differentiation from other dementias. However, challenges such as data limitations, sample size , and model generalizability remain. Disclosure: Dr. Hefnawy has nothing to disclose. Dr. Serag has nothing to disclose.

39886322,Serum biomarkers as prognostic markers for Alzheimer's disease in a clinical setting.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and phosphorylated tau (pTau) have shown promising prognostic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their applicability in clinical settings where comorbidities are prevalent remains uncertain.
METHODS: Simoa assays quantified GFAP, NfL, and pTau181 in retrospectively retrieved prediagnostic serum samples from 102 AD patients and 21 non-AD controls.
RESULTS: Higher serum GFAP levels predicted earlier clinical presentation and faster subsequent Mini-Mental State Examination decline in AD patients. Serum NfL levels were increased in patients with arterial hypertension (AHT), kidney dysfunction, and a history of stroke and only demonstrated predictive value for time to clinical AD presentation after adjustment for these comorbidities. Serum pTau181 instability during long-term storage at -20°C prevented its prognostic evaluation in retrospectively retrieved serum samples.
DISCUSSION: Serum GFAP is a robust prognostic marker for AD progression, whereas NfL is impacted by various comorbidities, which complicates the interpretation of its prognostic value.
HIGHLIGHTS: Serum GFAP levels predict time to clinical AD presentation.Serum NfL levels are increased by hypertension, kidney disease, and stroke history.Prognostic value of serum NfL in AD is only evident after comorbidity correction.Serum levels of GFAP, but not NfL, increase over time within prediagnostic AD stages.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39713841,Stabilization of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes regulates Aβ generation in a three-dimensional neural model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: We previously demonstrated that regulating mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) affects axonal Aβ generation in a well-characterized three-dimensional (3D) neural Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. MAMs vary in thickness and length, impacting their functions. Here, we examined the effect of MAM thickness on Aβ in our 3D neural model of AD.
METHODS: We employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence-based MAM stabilizers, electron microscopy, Aβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and live-cell imaging with kymography to assess how stabilizing MAMs of different gap widths influence Aβ production and MAM axonal mobility.
RESULTS: Stabilizing tight MAMs (∼6 nm gap width) significantly increased Aβ levels, whereas basal (∼25 nm) and loose MAMs (∼40 nm) maintained or reduced Aβ levels, respectively. Tight MAMs reduced mitochondrial axonal velocity compared to basal MAMs, while loose MAMs showed severely reduced axonal distribution.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that stabilizing MAMs of specific gap widths, particularly in axons, without complete destabilization could be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The stabilization of MAMs exacerbates or ameliorates Aβ generation from AD neurons in a MAM gap width-dependent manner. A specific stabilization threshold within the MAM gap width spectrum shifts the amyloidogenic process to non-amyloidogenic. Tight MAMs slow down mitochondrial axonal transport compared to lose MAMs offering a quantitative method for measuring MAM stabilization.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39820594,Moroccan natural products for multitarget-based treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A computational study.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs neurocognitive functions. Acetylcholinesterase, Butyrylcholinesterase, Monoamine Oxidase B, Beta-Secretase, and Glycogen Synthase Kinase Beta play central roles in its pathogenesis. Current medications primarily inhibit AChE but fail to halt or reverse disease progression due to the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's. This underscores the necessity of developing multi-target ligands for effective treatment. This study investigates the potential of phytochemical compounds from Moroccan medicinal plants as multi-target agents against Alzheimer's disease, employing computational approaches. A virtual screening of 386 phytochemical compounds, followed by an assessment of pharmacokinetic properties and ADMET profiles, led to the identification of two promising compounds, naringenin (C23) and hesperetin (C24), derived from Anabasis aretioides. These compounds exhibit favourable pharmacokinetic profiles and strong binding affinities for the five key targets associated with the disease. Density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM-GBSA calculations further confirmed their structural stability, with a slight preference for C24, exhibiting superior intermolecular interactions and overall stability. These findings provide a strong basis for further experimental research, including in vitro and in vivo studies, to substantiate their potential efficacy in Alzheimer's disease.",PLoS One,2025
40194074,Cross-Trial Knowledge Transfer in Alzheimer's Disease: A Machine Learning Approach Using the EXPEDITION Trials (S15.003).,"OBJECTIVE: To develop methods for enriching Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment trials with individuals likely to show clinically meaningful cognitive decline (CMCD) if treated with placebo.
BACKGROUND: Up to 45% of participants in the placebo arm of AD trials show no CMCD over 80 weeks. Enriching trial populations for individuals likely to decline should increase the power to detect treatment effects.
DESIGN/METHODS: We utilized data from patients with mild AD dementia from the placebo arms of the EXPEDITION1 and EXPEDITION2 trials (N=1025) to develop predictive models. Participants were categorized as Cognitively Stable (CS, defined as an ADAS-Cog14 change of <4 at week 80) or as having CMCD, defined as an ADAS-Cog14 change of ≥4 at trial completion (week 80s) (N=459). Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayses, K Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest were trained to distinguish between CS and CMCD participants using a combination of demographic data, clinical data including Clinical Dementia Rating test (CDR), Geriatric Depression Scale test (GDS), Mini-Mental State Examination test (MMSE), and biomarkers, including APOE4 genotype and volumetric MRI. The trained models were then applied to classify participants in an external validation sample from the EXPEDITION3 study (N=1072).
RESULTS: Eligible participants from the EXPEDITION3 trial (N=838) had an average age of 72.7 ± 7.8 years; 59% were female. CS status was observed in 44.9% of participants at the final visit while CMCD occurred in 55.1%. Highest performing model showed a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 52%, and AUC of 61%. The positive predictive values (PPVs) were 9% higher than the base prevalence of CMCD observed at the end of the trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that predictive models could enhance the design of Alzheimer's Disease trials by allowing for selective exclusion of participants likely to show clinically meaningful cognitive decline over 80 weeks of follow-up.

40093920,Retinal microvascular density and inner thickness in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major healthcare challenge, with existing diagnostics being costly/infeasible. This study explores retinal biomarkers from optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) as a cost-effective and non-invasive solution to differentiate AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs).
METHODS: Participants from the CALLIOPE Research Program were classified as ""Dem"" (AD and early AD), ""MCI,"" and ""HCs"" using neuropsychological tests and clinical diagnosis by a neurologist. OCT/OCTA examinations were conducted using the RTVue XR 100 Avanti SD-OCT system (VISIONIX), with retinal parameters extracted. Statistical analysis included normality and homogeneity of variance (HOV) tests to select ANOVA methods. Post-hoc analyses utilized Mann-Whitney U, Dunnett, or Tukey-HSD tests based on parameters' normality and HOV. Correlations with age were assessed via Pearson or Spearman tests. A generalized linear model (GLM) using Tweedie regression modeled the relationship between OCT/OCTA parameters and MMSE scores, correcting for age. Another ordinal logistic GLM (OL-GLM) modeled OCT/OCTA parameters against classes, adjusting for multiple confounders.
RESULTS: We analyzed 357 participants: 44 Dem, 139 MCI, and 174 HCs. Significant microvascular density (VD) reductions around the fovea were linked with MCI and Dem compared to HCs. Age-related analysis associated thickness parameters with HCs' old age. Our OL-GLM demonstrated significant thickness/volume reductions in Inner_Retina and Full_Retina layers. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and perimeter were initially not correlated with cognitive decline; however, OL-GLM significantly associated FAZ perimeter enlargement with Dem and MCI groups. Significant average and inferior peripapillary RNFL thinning were linked to Dem and MCI groups.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine VD changes in G grid sections among Dem, MCI, and HCs. We found a significant association between various VD parameters and cognitive decline. Most macular thickness/volume changes did not correlate with cognitive decline initially; however, our OL-GLM succeeded, highlighting the importance of the confounders' corrections. Our analysis excluded individual retinal layer parameters due to limitations; however, the literature suggests their value. Our study confirmed existing biomarkers' efficacy and uncovered novel retinal parameters for cognitive decline, requiring further validation.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025

40148444,A personalized metabolic modelling approach through integrated analysis of RNA-Seq-based genomic variants and gene expression levels in Alzheimer's disease.,"Generating condition-specific metabolic models by mapping gene expression data to genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) is a routine approach to elucidate disease mechanisms from a metabolic perspective. On the other hand, integrating variants that perturb enzyme functionality from the same RNA-seq data may enhance GEM accuracy, offering insights into genome-wide metabolic pathology. Our study pioneers the extraction of both transcriptomic and genomic data from the same RNA-seq data to reconstruct personalized metabolic models. We map genes with significantly higher load of pathogenic variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onto a human GEM together with the gene expression data. Comparative analysis of the resulting personalized patient metabolic models with the control models shows enhanced accuracy in detecting AD-associated metabolic pathways compared to the case where only expression data is mapped on the GEM. Besides, several otherwise would-be missed pathways are annotated in AD by considering the effect of genomic variants.",Commun Biol,2025
39839076,"Perspective: Minimally clinically important ""symptomatic"" benefit associated with disease modification resulting from anti-amyloid immunotherapy.","UNLABELLED: Despite some skepticism regarding the amyloid hypothesis, there is growing evidence that clearing amyloid by targeting specific species of amyloid (plaque, oligomers, fibrils, and protofibrils) for removal has therapeutic benefits. Specifically, there is growing evidence that, in mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), robust and aggressive removal of amyloid can slow cognitive decline as measured by global instruments, composite measures, and cognitive testing. Furthermore, clinical efficacy signals coupled with clear biomarker changes provide the first evidence of disease modification. This effect seems to be in addition to symptomatic treatments and opens speculation that the effect of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies might be clinically meaningful through symptomatic amelioration that is a result of disease modification.

Meanwhile, low daily fluid intake was cross-sectionally related with cerebrovascular injury.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that high daily fluid intake is associated with decreased brain amyloid deposition, indicating that sufficient daily fluid intake may be helpful for prevention of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40128240,The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment.,"Cost-effective, noninvasive screening methods for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders remain an unmet need. The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset. To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment. The ABHT was self-administered among cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (n = 127), participants with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; n = 34), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 19). Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers. Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment. Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.",Sci Rep,2025
39747869,Modulation of glymphatic system by visual circuit activation alleviates memory impairment and apathy in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive amyloid deposition and cognitive decline, yet the pathological mechanisms and treatments remain elusive. Here we report the therapeutic potential of low-intensity 40 hertz blue light exposure in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings reveal that light treatment prevents memory decline in 4-month-old 5xFAD mice and motivation loss in 14-month-old 5xFAD mice, accompanied by restoration of glial water channel aquaporin-4 polarity, improved brain drainage efficiency, and a reduction in hippocampal lipid accumulation. We further demonstrate the beneficial effects of 40 hertz blue light are mediated through the activation of the vLGN/IGL-Re visual circuit. Notably, concomitant use of anti-Aβ antibody with 40 hertz blue light demonstrates improved soluble Aβ clearance and cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice. These findings offer functional evidence on the therapeutic effects of 40 hertz blue light in Aβ-related pathologies and suggest its potential as a supplementary strategy to augment the efficacy of antibody-based therapy.",Nat Commun,2025
39987791,"Brain activation in older adults during odor identification is related to ApoE, t-tau/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, and hippocampal volume.","Despite altered odor identification preceding and predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive decline, an inadequate understanding of how AD pathology affects odor memory functions limits its use as a preclinical biomarker. Multivariate linear regression was applied to whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activations during odor identification task (OID) responses in older adults without dementia (N = 36, 44.4 % ε4 carriers, M<sub>Age</sub>= 76.61). Apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele status, cerebrospinal fluid levels of total-tau to Amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub>, and MRI-derived hippocampal volume measures were used as predictors. The predictors described significant BOLD variation in regions that are associated with necessary OID functions and affected by AD neurodegeneration during OID responses; moreover, all predictors were associated with significant (P &lt; .001) negative BOLD effects in essential task regions during at least one response condition. This evidence suggests significant pathological effects of AD biomarkers on OID-response neural activity in older adults without dementia and should motivate future combined-biomarker investigations of OID functions in preclinical populations.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39698895,Sex-specific mechanisms of cerebral microvascular BK<sub>Ca</sub> dysfunction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular dysfunction occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), impairing hemodynamic regulation. Large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) regulate cerebrovascular reactivity and are impaired in AD. BK<sub>Ca</sub> activity depends on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks) and nitro-oxidative post-translational modifications. However, whether these mechanisms underlie BK<sub>Ca</sub> impairment in AD remains unknown.
METHODS: Cerebral arteries from 5x-FAD and wild-type (WT) littermates were used for molecular biology, electrophysiology, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments.
RESULTS: Arterial BK<sub>Ca</sub> activity is reduced in 5x-FAD via sex-dependent mechanisms: in males, there is lower BK<sub>α</sub> subunit expression and less Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks. In females, we observed reversible nitro-oxidative modification of BK<sub>Ca</sub>. Further, BK<sub>Ca</sub> is involved in hemodynamic regulation in WT mice, and its dysfunction is associated with vascular deficits in 5x-FAD.
DISCUSSION: Our data highlight the central role played by BK<sub>Ca</sub> in cerebral hemodynamic regulation and that molecular mechanisms of its impairment diverge based on sex in 5x-FAD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebral microvascular BK<sub>Ca</sub> dysfunction occurs in both female and male 5x-FAD. Reduction in BK<sub>α</sub> subunit protein and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks drive the dysfunction in males. Nitro-oxidative stress is present in females, but not males, 5x-FAD. Reversible nitro-oxidation of BK<sub>α</sub> underlies BK<sub>Ca</sub> dysfunction in female 5x-FAD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39754267,Transcriptomic predictors of rapid progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains an unmet need. Thus, identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high-risk of progressing to AD is crucial for early intervention.
METHODS: Blood-based transcriptomics analyses were performed using a longitudinal study cohort to compare progressive MCI (P-MCI, n = 28), stable MCI (S-MCI, n = 39), and AD patients (n = 49). Statistical DESeq2 analysis and machine learning methods were employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and develop prediction models.
RESULTS: We discovered a remarkable gender-specific difference in DEGs that distinguish P-MCI from S-MCI. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI (AUC 0.93), AD from S-MCI (AUC 0.94), and AD from P-MCI (AUC 0.92). An 8-gene signature was identified for distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood-based transcriptomic biomarker signatures show great utility in identifying high-risk MCI patients, with mitochondrial processes emerging as a crucial contributor to AD progression.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40167924,Unraveling Potential Tauopathy Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid: Insights from Olfactory Tract Data.,"Due to the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is estimated to grow considerably in the next decades. Unfortunately, there are no current curative treatments for the majority of these disorders and this might be due to the lack of early diagnosis. Nowadays, diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders is mainly based on neuroimaging and clinical symptoms, although postmortem neuropathologic confirmation remains the gold-standard diagnostic technique. In this sense, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome is considered a valuable molecular repository for diagnosing and targeting the neurodegenerative process. On the other hand, olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom that affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies' patients. That is why we consider that the application of tissue proteomics in primary olfactory structures is an ideal approach to explore early pathophysiological changes, detecting olfactory proteins that might be tested in CSF as potential biomarkers. In this chapter, we have applied peptide fractionation methods followed by tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS), in silico analysis and semi-quantitative orthogonal techniques in the olfactory tract derived from AD subjects. After obtaining the differential OT proteome, we suggest that the use of different bioinformatic workflows might be a valuable workflow to discover potential disease biomarkers for AD and other tauopathies.",Methods Mol Biol,2025
39908645,Stability of locus coeruleus cell counts despite volume loss in cognitively impaired aged rhesus macaques.,"The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brainstem nucleus that provides the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) in the nervous system and optimizes behavioral performance in mammals. In humans, the LC shows Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology at its earliest stages, but little is known about LC integrity in normative, non-pathological aging. The present research addresses these gaps by investigating neuron numbers, densities of glia and vasculature, and volume of the LC itself in cognitively assessed adult and aged rhesus macaques. These primates do not spontaneously exhibit AD, and thus are an excellent model for normative human aging. Immunohistochemical methods were used to quantify noradrenaline-producing cells, total cells, and vascular and glial density in the LC, and use a recently developed alignment protocol to incorporate Nissl- and immunohistochemically stained tissue with previously collected magnetic resonance images to generate precise volumes of the LC and its' subcompartments. The medial LC subcompartment alone (not the lateral or compact regions) in aged animals showed significantly smaller volume than did the adult monkeys, however, there was no difference in NA-containing cell numbers, vascular or glial densities observed in any compartment between age groups. Additionally, volumes and cell counts were not significantly associated with performance on memory tasks, indicating that cell populations within the locus coeruleus nucleus itself are highly resistant to age-related change.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39998475,A head-to-head comparison of plasma biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease in a memory clinic.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been widely studied, but direct comparisons of several biomarkers in clinical settings remain limited.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma biomarkers from 197 participants in the BIODEGMAR cohort (Hospital del Mar, Barcelona) were analyzed. Participants were classified based on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers. We assessed the ability of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, t-tau, and Aβ42/40 to classify Aβ pathology status.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers had a greater diagnostic performance and larger effect sizes compared to t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Aβ pathology. Among them, plasma p-tau217 consistently outperformed the others, demonstrating superior area under the curves. Furthermore, p-tau217 showed the strongest correlation between plasma and CSF levels, underscoring its potential as a reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: Several plasma biomarkers, targeting different epitopes and using different platforms, demonstrated high performance in detecting AD in a memory clinic setting.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers demonstrated higher diagnostic performance and larger effect sizes than t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Alzheimer's disease. Among the p-tau biomarkers, p-tau217 assays consistently outperformed the others, providing superior classification of Aβ pathology status across different phosphorylation sites. p-tau217 assays showed the strongest correlation between plasma and CSF levels, indicating its potential as a reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers. Several plasma p-tau biomarkers can be used in a specialized memory clinic to accurately detect Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39837054,The moderating effect of diet on the relationship between depressive symptoms and Alzheimer's disease-related blood-based biomarkers.,"Associations between mental health, diet, and risk of Alzheimer's disease highlight the need to investigate whether dietary patterns moderate the relationship between symptoms of depression and anxiety, and neurodegeneration-related blood-based biomarkers. Cognitively unimpaired participants (n = 89) were included from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (mean age 75.37; 44 % male). Participants provided dietary, depressive and anxiety symptom data, and had measurement of blood-based biomarkers. Dietary pattern scores (Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), and Western diet) were generated. Moderation and simple slope analyses were employed. In males with mean and below mean MeDi adherence, depressive symptoms were associated with higher neurofilament light (NfL) levels. In Apolipoprotein E ε4 non-carriers with lower than mean and mean MeDi adherence, depressive symptoms were associated with higher NfL and Aβ40 levels. No associations were observed between DASH and Western diets and neurodegeneration-related biomarkers. MeDi adherence is potentially a moderator of the relationship between depressive symptoms and neurodegeneration-related blood-based biomarkers, with sex- and genotype-specific approaches important to consider within this relationship.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39730532,A proficient approach for the classification of Alzheimer's disease using a hybridization of machine learning and deep learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. It causes progressive degeneration of the nervous system, affecting the cognitive ability of the human brain. Over the past two decades, neuroimaging data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans has been increasingly used in the study of brain pathology related to the birth and growth of AD. Recent studies have employed machine learning to detect and classify AD. Deep learning models have also been increasingly utilized with varying degrees of success. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for early detection and classification of AD using structural MRI (sMRI). The proposed model employs a unique combination of machine learning and deep learning approaches to optimize the precision and accuracy of the detection and classification of AD. The proposed approach surpassed multi-modal machine learning algorithms in accuracy, precision, and F-measure performance measures. Results confirm an outperformance compared to the state-of-the-art in AD versus CN and sMCI versus pMCI paradigms. Within the CN versus AD paradigm, the designed model achieves 91.84% accuracy on test data.",Sci Rep,2024
39817500,The association of seizure control with neuropathology in dementia.,"Seizures in people with dementia (PWD) are associated with faster cognitive decline and worse clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between ongoing seizure activity and postmortem neuropathology in PWD remains unexplored. We compared post-mortem findings in PWD with active, remote, and no seizures using multicentre data from 39 Alzheimer's Disease Centres from 2005 to 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into active (seizures over the preceding one year), remote (prior seizures but none in the preceding year), and no seizures (controls). Baseline demographics, cognition, mortality, and postmortem findings of primary and contributing(co-pathologies) Alzheimer's Disease(AD), Frontotemporal lobar degeneration(FTD), Lewy body, vascular pathologies and neurodegeneration were compared among the groups using Pearson's Chi-squared test, fisher's exact test, t-test, and ANOVA tests. Of 10,474 deceased PWD, active seizure participants suffered the highest mortality among the groups(proportion deceased among the groups: active=56%remote=35%, controls=34%, p<0.001). Among 6085 (58.1% of deceased) who underwent autopsy, 294 had active, 151 had remote, and 5640 had no seizures. PWD and active seizures died at a younger age (Active=75.8, remote=77.9, controls: 80.8 years, p <0.001) and had more severe dementia (CDR-Global: active=2.36, remote=1.90, controls=1.69, p<0.001). In post hoc analyses, those with primary postmortem diagnosis of AD with active seizures had more severe and later stages of AD pathology and ATN (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration) as evidenced by Braak stage for neurofibrillary(tau) degeneration and CERAD score density of neuritic(amyloid) plaques than remote seizure participants and controls. Active seizure participants had more neurodegeneration, evidenced by cerebral atrophy, hippocampal atrophy, and locus coeruleus hypopigmentation than controls. Among participants with primary postmortem diagnosis of non-AD, in posthoc analyses, active seizure participants had worse AD co-pathology evidenced by higher Braak stages than remote seizures and controls and a higher thal phase of beta-amyloid plaques than controls. Neurodegeneration (cerebral/hippocampal atrophy) and LC hypopigmentation were comparable among the groups. In both primary postmortem AD and non-AD diagnoses, FTD (co)pathology was less prevalent among active seizure participants than controls, while vascular pathology, Circle of Willis atherosclerosis, Lewy body pathology, lobar atrophy, and substantia nigra hypopigmentation were comparable among the three groups. This study shows that active, compared to remote seizures, are associated with earlier death and postmortem evidence of more severe ATN pathology. Active seizures are associated with more advanced AD pathology in AD and worse AD co-pathology in non-AD dementias. Therefore, clinicians should be vigilant in detecting ongoing seizures as this could reflect a worse prognosis in PWD.",Brain,2025
39778705,Human longevity and Alzheimer's disease variants act via microglia and oligodendrocyte gene networks.,"Ageing underlies functional decline of the brain and is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms that cause functional decline of the brain during ageing, and how these contribute to AD pathogenesis, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to identify biological processes that are altered during ageing in the hippocampus and that modify Ad risk and lifespan, and then to identify putative gene drivers of these programmes. We integrated common human genetic variation associated with human lifespan or Ad from genome-wide association studies with co-expression transcriptome networks altered with age in the mouse and human hippocampus. Our work confirmed that genetic variation associated with Ad was enriched in gene networks expressed by microglia responding to ageing and revealed that they were also enriched in an oligodendrocytic gene network. Compellingly, longevity-associated genetic variation was enriched in a gene network expressed by homeostatic microglia whose expression declined with age. The genes driving this enrichment include CASP8 and STAT3, highlighting a potential role for these longevity-associated genes in the homeostatic functions of innate immune cells, and these genes might drive 'inflammageing'. Thus, we observed that gene variants contributing to ageing and AD balance different aspects of microglial and oligodendrocytic function. Furthermore, we also highlight putative Ad risk genes, such as LAPTM5, ITGAM and LILRB4, whose association with Ad falls below genome-wide significance but show strong co-expression with known Ad risk genes in these networks. Indeed, five of the putative risk genes highlighted by our analysis, ANKH, GRN, PLEKHA1, SNX1 and UNC5CL, have subsequently been identified as genome-wide significant risk genes in a subsequent genome-wide association study with larger sample size, validating our analysis. This work identifies new genes that influence ageing and AD pathogenesis, and highlights the importance of microglia and oligodendrocytes in the resilience of the brain against ageing and AD pathogenesis. Our findings have implications for developing markers indicating the physiological age of the brain and new targets for therapeutic intervention.",Brain,2025
40135149,Cardiovascular rate pressure product is associated with NfL in older adults at risk for AD.,"INTRODUCTION: Elevated cardiovascular rate pressure product (RPP) has been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality and is associated with poor cognitive test performance among older adults. However, it is unclear how RPP is related to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
METHODS: RPP was cross-sectionally evaluated as a predictor of CSF biomarker levels in a cohort of 310 cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease. The primary outcomes were CSF levels of α-Synuclein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light (NfL), soluble triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2, and total tau. Further analyses examined amyloid beta (Aβ)42/Aβ40, phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), and pTau181/Aβ4.
RESULTS: RPP was positively associated with NfL (β = 0.006, R <sup>2</sup> = 0.411, p = 0.012, but Bonferroni-corrected p ≤ 0.006) and not with other CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation investigated in this sample.
DISCUSSION: A high myocardial oxygen demand at rest may be related to neuronal death and axonal degeneration in cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: We explored the relationship between RPP and CSF analytes.Higher RPP was associated with higher NfL but not other measured CSF biomarkers.HR was positively associated with NfL, whereas SBP was not.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39988952,Evaluation of two plasma-based proteotyping assays against APOE ε4 genotyping in a memory clinic setting: The Gothenburg H70 Clinical Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele status is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and should be determined prior to initiation of anti-amyloid beta antibody treatment, because of increased risk of treatment-related side effects. Plasma-based apoE4 proteotyping may be an alternative to genotyping, with limited clinical evidence.
METHODS: apoE4 proteotyping was performed on 164 memory-clinic patients, using one chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and one nucleic acid-linked immunosandwich assay (NULISA). The assays were evaluated against APOE ε4 blood genotyping.
RESULTS: The CLEIA had a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify APOE ε4 homozygosity and carriership in relation to genotyping. The NULISA had a 92.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity to classify homozygosity and a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify carriership.
DISCUSSION: The high performance suggests that the assays may be used as an easily available tool for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step approach.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma-based proteotyping presented good to excellent sensitivity in identifying apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 homozygosity. The negative predictive value was also very good to excellent, allowing us to rule out APOE ε4 homozygosity with high precision. Assays with excellent precision show potential for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step approach.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40016209,The p3 peptides (Aβ<sub>17-40/42</sub>) rapidly form amyloid fibrils that cross-seed with full-length Aβ.,"The p3 peptides, Aβ<sub>17-40/42</sub>, are a common alternative cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein, and are found in diffuse amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's and Down Syndrome brains. The p3 peptides have been mis-named 'non-amyloidogenic'. Here we show p3<sub>40/42</sub> peptides rapidly form amyloid fibrils, with kinetics dominated by secondary nucleation. Importantly, cross-seeding experiments, with full-length Aβ induces a strong nucleation between p3 and Aβ peptides. The cross-seeding interaction is highly specific, and occurs only when the C-terminal residues are matched. We have imaged membrane interactions with p3, and monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and cell viability with p3 peptide. Together this data suggests the N-terminal residues influence, but are not essential for, membrane disruption. Single particle analysis of TEM images indicates p3 peptides can form ring-like annular oligomers. Patch-clamp electrophysiology, shows p3<sub>42</sub> oligomers are capable of forming large ion-channels across cellular membranes. A role for p3 peptides in disease pathology should be considered as p3 peptides are cytotoxic and cross-seed Aβ fibril formation in vitro.",Nat Commun,2025
40194031,Medically Refractory Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus in ARIA with Lecanemab (P1-3.017).,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of medically refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus in a patient with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with lecanemab.
BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown promising results for amyloid-lowering antibodies in the treatment of early-stage Alzheimer's disease. FDA approval was granted for lecanemab in 2023. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), including ARIA-E (edema) and ARIA-H (hemosiderin), have been reported as potential side effects. Although usually asymptomatic, ARIA may cause headaches, visual disturbances, confusion, and dizziness. Seizures have been reported in aducanumab-induced ARIA. Here, we report a case of lecanemab-induced ARIA resulting in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).
DESIGN/METHODS: NA.
RESULTS: An 84-year-old ApoE4 carrier female with a history of Alzheimer's disease on lecanemab with a recent diagnosis of ARIA-E (moderate) and ARIA-H (mild) presented with acute progressive confusion. Patient was diagnosed with asymptomatic ARIA by screening MRI eight weeks after lecanemab initiation. MRI revealed two distinct areas of edema in the left occipital and right temporal lobes, and four new microhemorrhages. The next lecanemab infusion was held. Two weeks later patient awoke with disorientation and slow, unsteady gait prompting ER presentation where aphasia and left gaze preference were observed. The patient subsequently had a 40-second bilateral tonic-clonic seizure with spontaneous resolution. The seizure was treated with lorazepam IV and levetiracetam IV load. Continuous EEG showed focal NCSE in the right temporal region (maximal at P4/T6/O2) corresponding to the known ARIA-E location, which continued after a second dose of lorazepam with loading of lacosamide. After loading of valproic acid, EEG continued to be on the ictal end of the ictal-interictal continuum suggesting medically refractory status epilepticus. MRI brain showed slight expansion of ARIA-E and stable ARIA-H compared to MRI completed two weeks prior. The patient was treated for severe ARIA with three days of high-dose methylprednisolone.

39994172,Alzheimer's disease with depression: clinical characteristics and potential mechanisms involving orexin and brain atrophy.,"This study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics and alteration of orexinergic level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the volumes of brain grey and white matters, and investigate the roles of orexinergic level on the association between brain atrophy and depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The demographic variables of 156 participants were collected. Orexinergic level in CSF and the volumes of brain grey and white matters were evaluated. The correlations of orexinergic level in CSF with depression and brain volume in AD patients were analyzed. The mediating effect of orexinergic level in CSF on the association between brain atrophy and depression in AD patients was investigated. The joint predictive value of orexinergic level in CSF and brain volume for depression in AD patients was established. AD with depression patients showed significantly elevated levels of orexin A and orexin B in CSF; orexin A level in CSF was positively correlated with HAMD score in AD patients. The elevated orexin A level in CSF mediated 49.6% of total association between the decreased grey matter volume of right dorsal medial thalamic nucleus and depression, and 50.3% of total association between the reduced white matter volume of left amygdala and depression. Combinations of above parameters could predict depression in AD patients with a significantly high area under the curve (AUC = 0.841). Therefore, the elevated orexin A level in CSF mediates its effect on the atrophy of the right dorsal medial thalamic nucleus and the white matter of the left amygdala, eventually alleviating depression in AD.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
39998900,Tau pathology is associated with postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in early Alzheimer's disease in a sex-specific manner.,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the associations of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) with tau deposition and cognitive ability in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Twenty-six cognitively impaired (CI) and 14 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals underwent mGluR5 positron emission tomography (PET) ([<sup>18</sup>F]PSS232), amyloid PET ([<sup>18</sup>F]florbetapir), and tau PET ([<sup>18</sup>F]MK6240), and neuropsychological assessment. The relationships among mGluR5 availability, tau deposition, and neuropsychological assessment were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and mediation analyses.
RESULTS: CI patients had lower mGluR5 in the hippocampus than CU (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr]: 2.03 ± 0.25 vs 1.79 ± 0.17, p = 0.003). Hippocampal mGluR5 was negatively associated with hippocampal tau deposition (r = -.46, p = 0.003) and positively associated with cognitive performance, but only in women. Hippocampal tau deposition mediated the effect of mGluR5 on cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: Reduced hippocampal mGluR5 is negatively related with tau deposition in most cortical regions and positively associated with cognitive performance, making it a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively impaired (CI) patients exhibited lower metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability in the hippocampus than cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was negatively associated with tau deposition in widespread cortex. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was positively associated with cognitive performance. The close association of mGluR5 with tau and cognition performance exists only in females. Tau pathology mediated the relationship between mGluR5 availability and cognition.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39814545,Icariin improves learning and memory function by enhancing HRD1-mediated ubiquitination of amyloid precursor protein in APP/PS1 mice.,"BACKGROUND: One of the hallmark pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulated in brain, which is mainly derived from the proteolytic processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). The ubiquitin-proteasome system is able to reduce Aβ generation by ubiquitination and degradation of AβPP. Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid isolated from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim., has been reported that it could regulate the metabolism of AβPP and reduce the Aβ level in AD in vivo and in vitro models.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the effect of ICA on AβPP and Aβ is related to AβPP ubiquitination.
METHODS: We used in vivo and in vitro models to observe the effect of ICA on AβPP ubiquitination as well as to investigate the effect of HMG-CoA reductase degradation protein 1 (HRD1), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, on the processing of AβPP ubiquitination.
RESULTS: This study showed that ICA improved the cognitive abilities of APP/PS1 AD mice in Morris Water Maze and Y-maze tests, upregulated HRD1 expression, subsequently elevated the total ubiquitination and K48-linked polyubiquitination of AβPP level, as well as increased AβPP degradation. Moreover, silenced HRD1 gene abolished the aforementioned effects of ICA. Furthermore, ICA decreased the location of AβPP in the early endosome, where AβPP is cleaved into Aβ, evidenced by reducing the co-localization of AβPP and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ICA increased AβPP degradation by upregulating HRD1 mediated ubiquitination.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39843233,Cell Adhesion Molecule Protocadherin-γC5 Ameliorates Aβ Plaque Pathogenesis by Modulating Astrocyte Function in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Accumulation of astrocytes around β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms and significance remain unclear. Cell adhesion molecule protocadherin-γC5 (Pcdh-γC5) has been reported to implicate in AD. Here, we find elevated expression levels of Pcdh-γC5 in the brain of 5×FAD mice and Aβ-treated astrocytes and further reveal that Pcdh-γC5 deficiency leads to exacerbated Aβ deposition in 5×FAD mice. Deletion of Pcdh-γC5 impairs astrocyte migration, astrocytic response to Aβ signaling, and Aβ phagocytosis in both cultured astrocytes in vitro and 5×FAD mice in vivo. Both male and female mice were used in this study. Our findings support a model in which increased expression level of Pcdh-γC5 promotes astrocyte migration in response to Aβ signaling and engulfment and phagocytosis of neurotoxic Aβ plaques, therefore exerting a critical neuroprotective function in AD.",J Neurosci,2025
40156286,Diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 for Alzheimer's disease in clinical and community cohorts.,"INTRODUCTION: This study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217/amyloid beta (Aβ) 42 ratio test for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: The diagnostic performance of the Lumipulse G plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio was evaluated using Aβ and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as reference standards in a clinic cohort (n = 391) and a community cohort (n = 121).
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 exhibited high performance for abnormal statuses of Aβ PET (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.963 to 0.966) and tau PET (AUC: 0.947 to 0.974), which were clinically equivalent to those of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181/Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher than those of blood p-tau217, Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and p-tau181/Aβ42 in both clinic and community cohorts. Applying a two-cutoff approach improved the specificity without reducing sensitivity. The p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio had a lower intermediate percentage than p-tau217 alone in both clinic (10.6% vs 13.0%) and community (16.5% vs 31.4%) cohorts.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 has high performance in detecting cerebral AD pathologies, thus offering a promising tool for clinical diagnosis and community screening of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lumipulse G plasma p-tau217 and the p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio accurately identified abnormal Aβ and tau PET statuses in both clinical and community cohorts. The performance of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio were equivalent to CSF tests. Plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio outperformed p-tau217 alone in identifying Aβ PET positivity, and this superiority is more obvious in the community cohort, suggesting an advantage in the early diagnosis of AD. Two cut points of p-tau217/Aβ42 were established in the Chinese population for clinical laboratory and community screening uses.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39975465,Clinically meaningful outcomes in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias trials.,"UNLABELLED: On March 12-14, 2024, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) together with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) led a workshop exploring clinically meaningful changes in the context of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) clinical trials (https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/workshops/clinically-meaningful-outcomes-ad-adrd-trials). The goals were to identify research gaps, opportunities, and tools to advance patient-centered, equitable assessment of clinically meaningful change focused on biomarker status, cognition, and everyday function. The workshop fostered robust, multidisciplinary discussion between lived experience experts, advocates, researchers, clinicians, funders, payers, and regulators. The workshop addressed the criteria used to assess whether an intervention has had a clinically meaningful impact, including consideration of both benefit and harm. Here, we report on (1) criteria to consider for development, testing, and selection of clinically meaningful outcomes in AD/ADRD clinical trials; (2) methods to validate and customize clinically meaningful outcomes that are fit-for-purpose; and (3) practices that will ensure that clinically meaningful outcomes are applicable to diverse populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Patient-Centered Outcomes: Inclusive AD/ADRD clinical trials incorporate assessments that reflect what matters most to those impacted by these diseases, including patient- and caregiver-reported outcome measures. Culturally Relevant Assessments: There is a need for culturally sensitive and equitable assessments to better serve diverse populations in AD/ADRD research. Framework for Clinically Meaningful Change: We present a framework for defining and evaluating clinically meaningful outcomes in AD/ADRD trials, tailored to diverse stages of disease progression. Interdisciplinary Approach: We draw on insights from a multidisciplinary workshop, fostering collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and lived experience experts to advance the field.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39772750,Unveiling neural activity changes in mild cognitive impairment using microstate analysis and machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a condition that may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the neural correlates of MCI is crucial for elucidating its pathophysiology and developing effective interventions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstates, reflecting brain activity changes, have shown promise in MCI research. However, current approaches often lack comprehensive characterization of the complex neural dynamics associated with MCI.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate neurophysiological changes associated with MCI using a comprehensive set of microstate features, including traditional temporal features and entropy measures.
METHODS: Resting-state EEG data were collected from 69 MCI patients and healthy controls (HC). Microstate analysis was performed to extract conventional features (duration, coverage) and entropy measures. Statistical analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to evaluate neurophysiological patterns associated with MCI.
RESULTS: MCI displayed altered microstate dynamics, with significantly longer coverage and duration in Microstate C but shorter in Microstates A, B, and D compared to HCs. PCA revealed two principal components, primarily composed of microstate dynamics and entropy measures, explaining over 75% of the variance. ML models achieved high accuracy in distinguishing MCI patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive analysis of EEG microstate features provides new insights into neurophysiological changes associated with MCI, highlighting the potential of EEG microstates for investigating complex neural changes in cognitive decline.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39779375,Amyloid-β-Driven Synaptic Deficits Are Mediated by Synaptic Removal of GluA3-Containing AMPA Receptors.,"The detrimental effects of oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) on synapses are considered the leading cause for cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. However, through which mechanism Aβ oligomers impair synaptic structure and function remains unknown. Here, we used electrophysiology and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) imaging on mouse and rat neurons to demonstrate that GluA3 expression in neurons lacking GluA3 is sufficient to resensitize their synapses to the damaging effects of Aβ, indicating that GluA3-containing AMPARs at synapses are necessary and sufficient for Aβ to induce synaptic deficits. We found that Aβ oligomers trigger the endocytosis of GluA3 and promote its translocation toward endolysosomal compartments for degradation. Mechanistically, these Aβ-driven effects critically depend on the PDZ-binding motif of GluA3. A single point mutation in the GluA3 PDZ-binding motif prevented Aβ-driven effects and rendered synapses fully resistant to the effects of Aβ. Correspondingly, proteomics on synaptosome fractions from APP/PS1-transgenic mice revealed a selective reduction of GluA3 at an early age. These findings support a model where the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of GluA3-containing AMPARs are a critical early step in the cascade of events through which Aβ accumulation causes a loss of synapses.",J Neurosci,2025
39738312,Detection of fungal sequences in human brain: rDNA locus amplification and deep sequencing.,"The aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are unknown and tend to manifest at a late stage in life; even though these neurodegenerative diseases are caused by different affected proteins, they are both characterized by neuroinflammation. Links between bacterial and viral infection and AD/PD has been suggested in several studies, however, few have attempted to establish a link between fungal infection and AD/PD. In this study we adopted a nanopore-based sequencing approach to characterise the presence or absence of fungal genera in both human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We observed the presence of small fungal burden DNA in two AD brains and a control case (extensive amyloid angiopathy). This approach would be well-placed to investigate potential links between microbial infection and neurodegenerative disease.",Sci Rep,2024
39864527,Unveiling the significance of AKAP79/150 in the nervous system disorders: An emerging opportunity for future therapies?,"A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150) is a crucial scaffolding protein that positions various proteins at specific synaptic sites to modulate excitatory synaptic intensity. As our understanding of AKAP79/150's biology deepens, along with its significant role in the pathophysiology of various human disorders, there is growing evidence that reveals new opportunities for therapeutic interventions. In this review, we examine the fundamental structure and primary functions of AKAP79/150, emphasizing its pathophysiological mechanisms in different nervous system disorders, particularly inflammatory pain, epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. We also discuss its potential therapeutic implications for patients suffering from these conditions.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
40110656,"Using remote, digital, multi-day testing to characterize long-term forgetting in cognitively unimpaired older adults.","INTRODUCTION: Accelerated long-term forgetting (LTF) might be an early marker of subtle memory changes in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We leveraged remote, multi-day digital testing to characterize LTF in older adults and investigated its association with initial learning and AD imaging biomarkers.
METHODS: One hundred four cognitively unimpaired older adults completed a face-name memory task for seven consecutive days and were asked to recognize face-name pairs 1 week later. LTF was computed as the number of correctly identified stimuli divided by a participant's maximum performance during learning.
RESULTS: Better learning was associated with less LTF (β = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.34-0.71, p < 0.001). Accelerated LTF was associated with cortical thinning in AD-signature regions (β = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13-0.52, p = 0.001), but associations with regional tau were more subtle.
DISCUSSION: Remote, multi-day testing may facilitate the assessment of LTF as an early cognitive marker of preclinical AD, but further replication is needed.
HIGHLIGHTS: Using digital, remote assessments, we evaluated long-term forgetting in cognitively unimpaired older adults. We found a potential association between long-term forgetting and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related regions. Assessing long-term forgetting may facilitate early detection of AD-related cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40188185,Personalized brain models link cognitive decline progression to underlying synaptic and connectivity degeneration.,"Cognitive decline is a condition affecting almost one sixth of the elder population and is widely regarded as one of the first manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the extensive body of knowledge on the condition, there is no clear consensus on the structural defects and neurodegeneration processes determining cognitive decline evolution. Here, we introduce a Brain Network Model (BNM) simulating the effects of neurodegeneration on neural activity during cognitive processing. The model incorporates two key parameters accounting for distinct pathological mechanisms: synaptic degeneration, primarily leading to hyperexcitation, and brain disconnection. Through parameter optimization, we successfully replicated individual electroencephalography (EEG) responses recorded during task execution from 145 participants spanning different stages of cognitive decline. The cohort included healthy controls, patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of the Alzheimer type. Through model inversion, we generated personalized BNMs for each participant based on individual EEG recordings. These models revealed distinct network configurations corresponding to the patient's cognitive condition, with virtual neurodegeneration levels directly proportional to the severity of cognitive decline. Strikingly, the model uncovered a neurodegeneration-driven phase transition leading to two distinct regimes of neural activity underlying task execution. On either side of this phase transition, increasing synaptic degeneration induced changes in neural activity that closely mirrored experimental observations across cognitive decline stages. This enabled the model to directly link synaptic degeneration and hyperexcitation to cognitive decline severity. Furthermore, the model pinpointed posterior cingulum fiber degeneration as the structural driver of this phase transition. Our findings highlight the potential of BNMs to account for the evolution of neural activity across stages of cognitive decline while elucidating the underlying neurodegenerative mechanisms. This approach provides a novel framework for understanding how structural and functional brain alterations contribute to cognitive deterioration along the Alzheimer's continuum.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39773540,Uncovering the epigenetic regulatory clues of PRRT1 in Alzheimer's disease: a strategy integrating multi-omics analysis with explainable machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a largely unexplored epigenetic landscape.
OBJECTIVE: This study employs an innovative approach that integrates multi-omics analysis and explainable machine learning to explore the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the epigenetic signature of PRRT1 implicated in AD.
METHODS: Through comprehensive DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiling, we identified distinct epigenetic signatures associated with gene PRRT1 expression in AD patient samples compared to healthy controls. Utilizing interpretable machine learning models and ELMAR analysis, we dissected the complex relationships between these epigenetic signatures and gene expression patterns, revealing novel regulatory elements and pathways. Finally, the epigenetic mechanisms of these genes were investigated experimentally.
RESULTS: This study identified ten epigenetic signatures, constructed an interpretable AD diagnostic model, and utilized various bioinformatics methods to create an epigenomic map. Subsequently, the ELMAR R package was used to integrate multi-omics data and identify the upstream transcription factor MAZ for PRRT1. Finally, experiments confirmed the interaction between MAZ and PRRT1, which mediated apoptosis and autophagy in AD.
CONCLUSION: This study adopts a strategy that integrates bioinformatics analysis with molecular experiments, providing new insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of PRRT1 in AD and demonstrating the importance of explainable machine learning in elucidating complex disease mechanisms.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39898987,Exacerbation of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias among nursing home residents.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted Black nursing home (NH) residents. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) may exacerbate disparities, however little empirical evidence exists on the degree to which race and ADRD intersect to impact COVID-19-related outcomes. We conducted a cohort study (April-December 2020) leveraging electronic health records from 12 United States NH corporations. We used parametric g-formula to obtain standardized estimates of incident COVID-19 infection and 30-day COVID-19-associated hospitalization or death by race, both overall and within strata of ADRD status. The cohort comprised 127,913 resident-episodes, including 15,379 incident COVID-19 infections, 1,522 deaths, and 2,548 hospitalizations. Black residents were more likely than White residents to experience incident COVID-19 and subsequent hospitalization, but not more likely to subsequently die. Disparities in hospitalization and a combined endpoint of hospitalization or death were more pronounced among residents with ADRD compared to residents without ADRD. These results suggest the presence of disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by race and provide evidence that ADRD status may exacerbate racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among nursing home residents. Our findings offer valuable insights for current and future preparedness efforts in NHs in the United States and countries with similarly under-resourced long-term care settings.",Am J Epidemiol,2025
39788087,The pathobiology of neurovascular aging.,"As global life expectancy increases, age-related brain diseases such as stroke and dementia have become leading causes of death and disability. The aging of the neurovasculature is a critical determinant of brain aging and disease risk. Neurovascular cells are particularly vulnerable to aging, which induces significant structural and functional changes in arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels. Consequently, neurovascular aging impairs oxygen and glucose delivery to active brain regions, disrupts endothelial transport mechanisms essential for blood-brain exchange, compromises proteostasis by reducing the clearance of potentially toxic proteins, weakens immune surveillance and privilege, and deprives the brain of key growth factors required for repair and renewal. In this review, we examine the effects of neurovascular aging on brain function and its role in stroke, vascular cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we discuss key unanswered questions that must be addressed to develop neurovascular strategies aimed at promoting healthy brain aging.",Neuron,2025
39975469,The Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA): A novel measure of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders health literacy in diverse populations.,"INTRODUCTION: Low health literacy about Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may limit help-seeking, early detection, and enrollment in clinical trials, particularly in minoritized communities. We created the Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA) to improve ADRD health literacy.
METHODS: The DeLA, a storytelling method that included culturally adaptable vignettes embedded with important factoids about ADRD, was administered to 213 participants from urban and rural regions of Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida and 193 participants in American Samoa.
RESULTS: The DeLA increased dementia health literacy and performed well across different participant characteristics (age, sex, education, geographic locale, race, ethnicity, and cognitive performance). Gains in ADRD health literacy were associated with older age, more education, better socioeconomic status, greater resilience, and better cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: Increasing ADRD health literacy could increase health-seeking behaviors in diverse populations for treatment, enrich recruitment into clinical trials, and may help reduce disparities in health outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Low health literacy about Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may limit help-seeking, early detection, and enrollment in clinical trials, particularly in minoritized communities.The Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA), a storytelling method that included culturally adaptable vignettes embedded with important factoids about ADRD, was administered to 406 participants from urban and rural regions of Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida and American Samoa (11.8% White, 39.8% Black or African American, and 48.4% Pacific Islander [predominantly Samoan] individuals).The DeLA increased dementia health literacy and performed well across different participant characteristics (age, sex, education, geographic locale, race, and cognitive performance).Gains in ADRD health literacy were associated with older age, more education, better socioeconomic status, greater resilience, and better cognitive performance.Increasing ADRD health literacy could increase health-seeking behaviors in diverse populations for treatment, enrich recruitment into clinical trials, and help reduce disparities in health outcomes.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39823562,Quantitative Assessment of the Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on Plasma P-Tau217 Concentrations.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) concentrations, potentially confounding the utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements as a marker of amyloid pathology in individuals with suspected Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we quantitatively investigate the relationship of plasma p-tau217 concentrations vs estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in individuals with CKD with and without amyloid pathology.
METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of data from 2 observational cohorts from either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohorts. p-Tau217 was determined using the ALZpath Simoa p-tau217 immunoassay and an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay that simultaneously measures p-tau217 and nonphosphorylated-tau217 (np-tau217) to determine %p-tau217 ([p-tau217/nonphosphorylated-tau217]) × 100%) (C<sub>2</sub>N Diagnostics). Amyloid positivity was defined by amyloid-PET and a centiloid of ≥25. Log-log linear regression fits were used to quantitatively predict increases in plasma p-tau217 associated with decreasing eGFR.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 202, mean age of 78 years, 38% female) with diagnoses of cognitive unimpairment (n = 109), mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), and dementia (n = 22) were included. In all, 114 (56%) of all participants were amyloid-PET positive (A+). In addition, 86 (43%) of all participants were classified as having CKD (CKD stages 3-4). p-Tau217 concentrations were significantly higher in A- participants with an eGFR of &lt;60 (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), as compared with those with eGFR &gt;60 A- participants. For an eGFR of 45 vs 60 in the A- cohort, the calculated percentage changes were +31%, +55%, and +19%, for ALZpath p-tau217, C<sub>2</sub>N p-tau217, and C<sub>2</sub>N %p-tau217, respectively. For the A+ cohort, the corresponding calculated percentage changes were +17%, +15%, and -5%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: CKD was associated with increased p-tau217 concentrations when measuring p-tau217 by ALZpath and C<sub>2</sub>N methodologies, but the effect was mitigated by the use of %p-tau217. These results indicate limitations for the utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements in individuals with significant renal impairment (eGFR &lt;45 or CKD stage 3b or greater). Determination of eGFR should be considered to avoid inaccurate classification of the presence of AD-related pathology by plasma p-tau217 in individuals with CKD.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in individuals with CKD stage 3 (especially stage 3b) or higher, p-tau217 concentrations are increased, with a greater increase in amyloid-PET-negative individuals.",Neurology,2025
39868637,Accelerometer-measured physical activity timing with incident dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is linked to lower dementia risk, though the optimal timing remains unclear.
METHODS: Using accelerometer-measured MVPA data from 90,329 dementia-free UK Biobank participants with at least 2 years of follow-up, we assessed associations between MVPA patterns (morning, afternoon, evening, mixed, inactive) and dementia risk via multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Compared to the inactive group, participants with a tendency of morning MVPA had a lower risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.90) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.86). No association of the other time point with all-cause dementia was observed. Additionally, the incidence of vascular dementia (VD) did not exhibit a significant relationship among all timing groups.
DISCUSSION: Morning MVPA was associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia and AD, while MVPA at any time point showed no association with VD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Few studies have examined accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) timing with incident dementia. Participants with a tendency of morning MVPA had a lower risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease. No significant association was found between all MVPA timing and vascular dementia (VD) risk. Findings suggest timing-specific physical activity interventions for dementia prevention.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40140622,Blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and incident dementia in the community.,"Evidence regarding the clinical validity of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population is limited. We estimated the hazard and predictive performance of six AD blood biomarkers for incident all-cause and AD dementia-the ratio of amyloid-β 42 to amyloid-β 40 and levels of tau phosphorylated at T217 (p-tau217), tau phosphorylated at T181 (p-tau181), total tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-in a cohort of 2,148 dementia-free older adults from Sweden, who were followed for up to 16 years. In multi-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated baseline levels of p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP were associated with a significantly increased hazard for all-cause and AD dementia, displaying a non-linear dose-response relationship. Elevated concentrations of p-tau181, p-tau217, NfL, and GFAP demonstrated strong predictive performance (area under the curve ranging from 70.9% to 82.6%) for 10-year all-cause and AD dementia, with negative predictive values exceeding 90% but low positive predictive values (PPVs). Combining p-tau217 with NfL or GFAP further improved prediction, with PPVs reaching 43%. Our findings suggest that these biomarkers have the potential to rule out impending dementia in community settings, but they might need to be combined with other biological or clinical markers to be used as screening tools.",Nat Med,2025
39733087,Exploring fatty acid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease: the key role of CPT1A.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease, and the most common type of dementia, with symptoms of progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment. Studying the pathogenesis of AD and exploring new targets for the prevention and treatment of AD is a very worthwhile challenge. Accumulating evidence has highlighted the effects of fatty acid metabolism on AD. In this study, fatty acid metabolism was used as an entry point to understand the pathogenesis of AD and identify new targets. After identifying differentially expressed genes, multiple machine learning algorithms, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A (CPT1A) was identified as the key gene for fatty acid metabolism in AD. Further single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis were performed, and the GSEA results showed that the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway was enriched only in astrocytes, and the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway was down-regulated in the AD astrocytes compared to the CN astrocytes, while CPT1A was specifically downregulated in astrocytes of AD, which was confirmed in vitro experiment subsequently, and decreased expression level of CPT1A would lead to abnormal lipid metabolism, which shapes astrocyte reactivity and injury, neuroinflammatory, and thus affects AD pathogenesis. Our findings report the involvement of CPT1A in AD. We confirm that the primary role of astrocytes for fatty acid β-oxidation, and CPT1A is localized in astrocytes. Downregulated CPT1A could be a novel potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD. Our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of fatty acid metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD.",Sci Rep,2024
39809992,"Brain-derived tau oligomer polymorphs: distinct aggregations, stability profiles, and biological activities.","Aggregation of microtubule-associated tau protein is a distinct hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Tau oligomers are suggested to be the primary neurotoxic species that initiate aggregation and propagate prion-like structures. Furthermore, different diseases are shown to have distinct structural characteristics of aggregated tau, denoted as polymorphs. Here, we investigate the structural and functional differences of amplified brain-derived tau oligomers (aBDTOs) from AD, DLB, and PSP. Our results indicate that the aBDTOs possess different structural and morphological features that impact neuronal function, gene regulation, and ultimately disease progression. The distinct tau oligomeric polymorphs may thus contribute to the development of clinical phenotypes and shape the progression of diseases. Our results can provide insight into developing personalized therapy to target a specific neurotoxic tau polymorph.",Commun Biol,2025
