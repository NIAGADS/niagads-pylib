21056013,Defining optimal treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.,"Despite growing recognition that Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global public health and social care crisis, diagnosis is frequently slow and many patients still receive no treatment at all. Of those who do receive treatment, many remain on lower than recommended doses. The Alzheimer's disease International Global Charter promotes awareness and understanding of AD, stressing the importance of optimal treatment. However, the definition of ""optimal treatment"" is unclear. Since cholinesterase inhibitors became available nearly 20 years ago, clinicians have developed a variety of protocols on the basis of clinical experiences. This review considers what is optimal for several aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, taking into account initiation strategies, dosages, modes of drug delivery (e.g., oral vs. transdermal), and treatment durations. Regardless of management approach, individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers have a right to a timely diagnosis and access to best available treatment.",Alzheimers Dement,2010
21149810,Association of higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in elderly individuals and lower risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To reexamine the association of lipid levels with Alzheimer disease (AD) using Cox proportional hazards models.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Northern Manhattan, New York.
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand one hundred thirty elderly individuals free of cognitive impairment at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.
RESULTS: Higher levels of HDL-C (>55 mg/dL) were associated with a decreased risk of both probable and possible AD and probable AD compared with lower HDL-C levels (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9; P = .03 and hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9; P = .03). In addition, higher levels of total and non-HDL-C were associated with a decreased risk of AD in analyses adjusting for age, sex, education, ethnic group, and APOE e4 genotype.
CONCLUSION: High HDL-C levels in elderly individuals may be associated with a decreased risk of AD.",Arch Neurol,2010
20569437,Neuroinflammation in Lyme neuroborreliosis affects amyloid metabolism.,"BACKGROUND: The metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) is widely studied in Alzheimer's disease, where Abeta deposition and plaque development are essential components of the pathogenesis. However, the physiological role of amyloid in the adult nervous system remains largely unknown. We have previously found altered cerebral amyloid metabolism in other neuroinflammatory conditions. To further elucidate this, we investigated amyloid metabolism in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).
METHODS: The first part of the study was a cross-sectional cohort study in 61 patients with acute facial palsy (19 with LNB and 42 with idiopathic facial paresis, Bell's palsy) and 22 healthy controls. CSF was analysed for the beta-amyloid peptides Abeta38, Abeta40 and Abeta42, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms alpha-sAPP and beta-sAPP. CSF total-tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and neurofilament protein (NFL) were measured to monitor neural cell damage. The second part of the study was a prospective cohort-study in 26 LNB patients undergoing consecutive lumbar punctures before and after antibiotic treatment to study time-dependent dynamics of the biomarkers.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, LNB patients had lower levels of CSF alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau, and higher levels of CSF NFL than healthy controls and patients with Bell's palsy. In the prospective study, LNB patients had low levels of CSF alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau at baseline, which all increased towards normal at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid metabolism is altered in LNB. CSF levels of alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau are decreased in acute infection and increase after treatment. In combination with earlier findings in multiple sclerosis, cerebral SLE and HIV with cerebral engagement, this points to an influence of neuroinflammation on amyloid metabolism.",BMC Neurol,2010
20879366,Simultaneous fine and coarse diffeomorphic registration: application to atrophy measurement in Alzheimer's disease.,"In this paper, we present a fine and coarse approach for the multiscale registration of 3D medical images using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM). This approach has particularly interesting properties since it estimates large, smooth and invertible optimal deformations having a rich descriptive power for the quantification of temporal changes in the images. First, we show the importance of the smoothing kernel and its influence on the final solution. We then propose a new strategy for the spatial regularization of the deformations, which uses simultaneously fine and coarse smoothing kernels. We have evaluated the approach on both 2D synthetic images as well as on 3D MR longitudinal images out of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Results highlight the regularizing properties of our approach for the registration of complex shapes. More importantly, the results also demonstrate its ability to measure shape variations at several scales simultaneously while keeping the desirable properties of LDDMM. This opens new perspectives for clinical applications.",Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv,2010
21193246,"Duplication of amyloid precursor protein (APP), but not prion protein (PRNP) gene is a significant cause of early onset dementia in a large UK series.","Amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) duplications have been identified in screens of selected probands with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). A causal role for copy number variation (CNV) in the prion protein gene (PRNP) in prion dementias is not known. We aimed to determine the prevalence of copy number variation in APP and PRNP in a large referral series, test a screening method for detection of the same, and expand knowledge of clinical phenotype. We used a 3-tiered screening assay for APP and PRNP duplication (exonic real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction [exon-qPCR], fluorescent microsatellite quantitative PCR [fm-q-PCR], and Illumina array [Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA]) for analysis of a heterogeneous referral series comprising 1531 probands. Five of 1531 probands screened showed APP duplication, a similar prevalence to APP missense mutation. Real-time quantitative PCR and fluorescent microsatellite quantitative PCR were similar individually but are theoretically complementary; we used Illumina arrays as our reference assay. Two of 5 probands were from an autosomal dominant early onset Alzheimer's disease (familial Alzheimer's disease) pedigree. One extensive, noncontiguous duplication on chromosome 21 was consistent with an unbalanced translocation not including the Down's syndrome critical region. Seizures were prominent in the other typical APP duplications. A range of imaging, neuropsychological, cerebrospinal fluid, and pathological findings are reported that extend the known phenotype. APP but not PRNP duplication is a significant cause of early onset dementia in the UK. The recognized phenotype may be expanded to include the possibility of early seizures and apparently sporadic disease which, in part, may be due to different mutational mechanisms. The pros and cons of our screening method are discussed.",Neurobiol Aging,2010
20980669,Hippocampal atrophy rates and CSF biomarkers in elderly APOE2 normal subjects.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elderly normal APOE E2 (APOE2) carriers exhibit slower rates of hippocampal atrophy and memory decline compared to APOE3/3 carriers. We also determined whether APOE2 carriers have less Alzheimer pathology as reflected by CSF biomarkers.
METHODS: We included longitudinal data from 134 cognitively normal individuals (27 APOE2/2 or E2/3, 107 APOE3/3) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a prospective cohort study. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determine how APOE2 affected rates of hippocampal atrophy and cognitive change over time. In a subsample of 72 individuals who also underwent CSF analysis, an ordinary least-squares regression was used to determine whether CSF β-amyloid (Aβ), total tau, and phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau) differed by APOE2 status.
RESULTS: APOE2 carriers demonstrated slower rates of hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.004). The mean rate of hippocampal atrophy among APOE2 carriers was -33 mm(3)/year (95% confidence interval -65 to +0.4), or -0.5%/year, compared to -86 mm(3)/year (95% confidence interval -102 to -71), or -1.3%/year, in the APOE3/3 group. No differences in the rates of episodic memory (p = 0.23) or overall cognitive change (p = 0.90) were detected. In the CSF subsample, APOE2 carriers had higher levels of CSF Aβ (p = 0.01), lower p-tau (p = 0.02), and marginally lower tau (p = 0.12).
CONCLUSION: A slower rate of hippocampal atrophy in normal APOE2 carriers is consistent with the lower risk of Alzheimer disease in these individuals. We hypothesize that the slower atrophy rate is related to decreased preclinical Alzheimer pathology.",Neurology,2010
20592257,Comparing predictors of conversion and decline in mild cognitive impairment.,"OBJECTIVE: A variety of measurements have been individually linked to decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but the identification of optimal markers for predicting disease progression remains unresolved. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of genetic, CSF, neuroimaging, and cognitive measurements obtained in the same participants.
METHODS: APOE epsilon4 allele frequency, CSF proteins (Abeta(1-42), total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau(181p)]), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic MCI (n = 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 +/- 0.4 years).
RESULTS: Patients with MCI converted to AD at an annual rate of 17.2%. Subjects with MCI who had abnormal results on both FDG-PET and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to AD than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p <or= 0.02). In addition, the CSF ratio p-tau(181p)/Abeta(1-42) (beta = 1.10 +/- 0.53; p = 0.04) and, marginally, FDG-PET predicted cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline FDG-PET and episodic memory predict conversion to AD, whereas p-tau(181p)/Abeta(1-42) and, marginally, FDG-PET predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Complementary information provided by these biomarkers may aid in future selection of patients for clinical trials or identification of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic intervention.",Neurology,2010
20938031,Hippocampal CA1 apical neuropil atrophy in mild Alzheimer disease visualized with 7-T MRI.,"OBJECTIVES: In Alzheimer disease (AD), mounting evidence points to a greater role for synaptic loss than neuronal loss. Supporting this notion, multiple postmortem studies have demonstrated that the hippocampal CA1 apical neuropil is one of the earliest sites of pathology, exhibiting tau aggregates and then atrophy before there is substantial loss of the CA1 pyramidal neurons themselves. In this cross-sectional study, we tested whether tissue loss in the CA1 apical neuropil layer can be observed in vivo in patients with mild AD.
METHODS: We performed ultra-high-field 7-T MRI on subjects with mild AD (n = 14) and age-matched normal controls (n = 16). With a 2-dimensional T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo sequence that was easily tolerated by subjects, we obtained cross-sectional slices of the hippocampus at an in-plane resolution of 195 μm.
RESULTS: On images revealing the anatomic landmarks of hippocampal subfields and strata, we observed thinning of the CA1 apical neuropil in subjects with mild AD compared to controls. By contrast, the 2 groups exhibited no difference in the thickness of the CA1 cell body layer or of the entire CA1 subfield. Hippocampal volume, measured on a conventional T1-weighted sequence obtained at 3T, also did not differentiate these patients with mild AD from controls.
CONCLUSIONS: CA1 apical neuropil atrophy is apparent in patients with mild AD. With its superior spatial resolution, 7-T MRI permits in vivo analysis of a very focal, early site of AD pathology.",Neurology,2010
20603481,Temporal course of depressive symptoms during the development of Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize change in depressive symptoms before and after the onset of dementia in Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHOD: We used data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of risk factors for AD in a geographically defined population of old people. Two subsets were analyzed. In 357 individuals who developed incident AD during the study, self-report of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) was obtained at 3-year intervals for a mean of 8 to 9 years. In 340 individuals who agreed to annual data collection, informant report of depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) was obtained for a mean of 3 years after a diagnosis of AD (n = 107), mild cognitive impairment (n = 81), or no cognitive impairment (n = 152).
RESULTS: The incident AD group reported a barely perceptible increase in depressive symptoms during 6 to 7 years of observation before the diagnosis (0.04 symptoms per year) and no change during 2 to 3 years of observation after the diagnosis except for a slight decrease in positive affect. In those with annual follow-up, neither AD nor its precursor, mild cognitive impairment, was associated with change in informant report of depressive symptoms during a mean of 3 years of observation.
CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms show little change during the development and progression of AD to a moderate level of dementia severity.",Neurology,2010
20713948,Multimodal predictors for Alzheimer disease in nonfluent primary progressive aphasia.,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are hypothesized to cause clinically distinct forms of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) that predominantly affect expressive speech. AD is thought to cause logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), and FTLD may cause progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). We sought to determine the value of clinical characterization, neuropsychological analysis, and MRI atrophy in predicting pathology of LPA and PNFA.
METHODS: Patients with LPA (n = 19) and patients with PNFA (n = 19) were evaluated with neuropsychological assessments, structural MRI, CSF analysis, and neuropathologic examination.
RESULTS: Twelve of 19 patients with LPA (63%) and 6 of 19 patients with PNFA (32%) had neuropathologic findings or CSF biomarkers consistent with AD. Neuropsychological testing showed that naming was more impaired in patients with AD, and letter-guided fluency was more affected in patients with a non-AD disorder. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that in patients with AD, patients with LPA and PNFA had significant posterior-superior temporal atrophy; in patients with non-AD, patients with LPA had peri-Sylvian atrophy and patients with PNFA had dorsolateral prefrontal and insular atrophy. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that combining neuropsychological testing with MRI atrophy pattern had 90% specificity for pathology or CSF biomarkers consistent with AD, and combining clinical features with neuropsychological analysis had 100% sensitivity for pathology or CSF biomarkers consistent with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither PPA phenotyping nor imaging alone is a reliable predictor of pathology. Multimodal predictors, such as combining neuropsychological testing with MRI analysis, can improve noninvasive prediction of underlying pathology in nonfluent forms of PPA.",Neurology,2010

20861451,"Vitamins B(12), B(6), and folic acid for cognition in older men.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether supplementing older men with vitamins B(12), B(6), and folic acid improves cognitive function.
METHODS: The investigators recruited 299 community-representative hypertensive men 75 years and older to a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of folic acid, vitamin B(6), and B(12) supplementation vs placebo over 2 years. The primary outcome of interest was the change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). A secondary aim of the study was to determine if supplementation with vitamins decreased the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia over 8 years.
RESULTS: The groups were well-balanced for demographic and biochemical parameters. There was no difference in the ADAS-cog change from baseline to 24 months between the placebo (0.8, SD 4.0) and vitamins group (0.7, SD 3.4). The adjusted scores in the treatment groups did not differ over time (placebo 0.2 lower, z = 0.71, p = 0.478). There was a nonsignificant 28% decrease in the risk of cognitive impairment (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.25-2.09) and dementia (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.29-1.78) over 8 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The daily supplementation of vitamins B(12), B(6), and folic acid does not benefit cognitive function in older men, nor does it reduce the risk of cognitive impairment or dementia.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that vitamin supplementation with daily doses of 500 μg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] of B(12), 2 mg of folic acid, and 25 mg of B(6) over 2 years does not improve cognitive function in hypertensive men aged 75 and older.",Neurology,2010
20625167,"Serial MRI and CSF biomarkers in normal aging, MCI, and AD.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the annual change in MRI and CSF biomarkers in cognitively normal (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer disease (AD). Comparisons were based on intergroup discrimination, correlation with concurrent cognitive/functional changes, relationships to APOE genotype, and sample sizes for clinical trials.
METHODS: We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study consisting of CN, aMCI, and AD cohorts with both baseline and 12-month follow-up CSF and MRI. The annual change in CSF (total-tau [t-tau], Abeta(1-42)) and MRI (change in ventricular volume) was obtained in 312 subjects (92 CN, 149 aMCI, 71 AD).
RESULTS: There was no significant average annual change in either CSF biomarker in any clinical group except t-tau in CN; moreover, the annual change did not differ by clinical group in pairwise comparisons. In contrast, annual increase in ventricular volume increased in the following order, AD > aMCI > CN, and differences were significant between all clinical groups in pairwise comparisons. Ventricular volume increase correlated with concurrent worsening on cognitive/functional indices in aMCI and AD whereas evidence of a similar correlation with change in CSF measures was unclear. The annual changes in MRI differed by APOE epsilon4 status overall and among aMCI while annual changes in CSF biomarkers did not. Estimated sample sizes for clinical trials are notably less for MRI than the CSF or clinical measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the CSF biomarkers evaluated, changes in serial structural MRI are correlated with concurrent change on general cognitive and functional indices in impaired subjects, track with clinical disease stage, and are influenced by APOE genotype.",Neurology,2010

Pneumoniae, Other Suspect Pathogens, and the Immune System.","Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes, APP and gamma-secretase, are involved in the herpes simplex life cycle, and that of other suspect pathogens (C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, C. neoformans, B. burgdorferri, P. gingivalis) or immune defence. Such pathogens promote beta-amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation and may thus be causative agents, whose effects are conditioned by genes. The antimicrobial effects of beta-amyloid, the localisation of APP/gamma-secretase in immunocompetent dendritic cells, and gamma secretase cleavage of numerous pathogen receptors suggest that this network is concerned with pathogen disposal, effects which may be abrogated by the presence of beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the elderly. These autoantibodies, as well as those to nerve growth factor and tau, also observed in Alzheimer's disease, may well be antibodies to pathogens, due to homology between human autoantigens and pathogen proteins. NGF or tau antibodies promote beta-amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, or cholinergic neuronal loss, and, with other autoantibodies, such as anti-ATPase, are potential agents of destruction, whose formation is dictated by sequence homology between pathogen and human proteins, and thus by pathogen strain and human genes. Pathogen elimination in the ageing population and removal of culpable autoantibodies might reduce the incidence and offer hope for a cure in this affliction.",Int J Alzheimers Dis,2011
21685912,Identification of common variants influencing risk of the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy.,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a movement disorder with prominent tau neuropathology. Brain diseases with abnormal tau deposits are called tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease. Environmental causes of tauopathies include repetitive head trauma associated with some sports. To identify common genetic variation contributing to risk for tauopathies, we carried out a genome-wide association study of 1,114 individuals with PSP (cases) and 3,247 controls (stage 1) followed by a second stage in which we genotyped 1,051 cases and 3,560 controls for the stage 1 SNPs that yielded P ≤ 10(-3). We found significant previously unidentified signals (P < 5 × 10(-8)) associated with PSP risk at STX6, EIF2AK3 and MOBP. We confirmed two independent variants in MAPT affecting risk for PSP, one of which influences MAPT brain expression. The genes implicated encode proteins for vesicle-membrane fusion at the Golgi-endosomal interface, for the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response and for a myelin structural component.",Nat Genet,2011
22189451,MRI cortical thickness biomarker predicts AD-like CSF and cognitive decline in normal adults.,"OBJECTIVE: New preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnostic criteria have been developed using biomarkers in cognitively normal (CN) adults. We implemented these criteria using an MRI biomarker previously associated with AD dementia, testing the hypothesis that individuals at high risk for preclinical AD would be at elevated risk for cognitive decline.
METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database was interrogated for CN individuals. MRI data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a single measure known as the AD signature (ADsig). Each individual was classified as ADsig-low (≥ 1 SD below the mean: high risk for preclinical AD), ADsig-average (within 1 SD of mean), or ADsig-high (≥ 1 SD above mean). A 3-year cognitive decline outcome was defined a priori using change in Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes and selected neuropsychological measures.
RESULTS: Individuals at high risk for preclinical AD were more likely to experience cognitive decline, which developed in 21% compared with 7% of ADsig-average and 0% of ADsig-high groups (p = 0.03). Logistic regression demonstrated that every 1 SD of cortical thinning was associated with a nearly tripled risk of cognitive decline (p = 0.02). Of those for whom baseline CSF data were available, 60% of the high risk for preclinical AD group had CSF characteristics consistent with AD while 36% of the ADsig-average and 19% of the ADsig-high groups had such CSF characteristics (p = 0.1).
CONCLUSIONS: This approach to the detection of individuals at high risk for preclinical AD-identified in single CN individuals using this quantitative ADsig MRI biomarker-may provide investigators with a population enriched for AD pathobiology and with a relatively high likelihood of imminent cognitive decline consistent with prodromal AD.",Neurology,2011
23124365,TDP-43 skeins show properties of amyloid in a subset of ALS cases.,"Aggregation of TDP-43 proteins to form intracellular inclusions is the primary pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP). Histologically, in the cerebral cortex and limbic regions of affected ALS and FTLD-TDP patients, these pathologies occur as a variety of cytoplasmic, neuritic and intranuclear TDP-43 inclusions. In the spinal cord and lower brainstem of ALS patients, the lesions form cytoplasmic dashes or complex filamentous and spherical profiles in addition to skein-like inclusions (SLI). Ultrastructurally, the morphology of TDP-43 inclusions is heterogeneous but mainly composed of loose bundles of 10- to 20-nm-diameter straight filaments associated with electron-dense granular material. All of these TDP-43 inclusions are generally described as disordered amorphous aggregations unlike the amyloid fibrils that characterize protein accumulations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We here report that Thioflavin-S positive SLI are present in a subset of ALS cases, while TDP-43 inclusions outside the spinal cord lack the chemical properties of amyloid. Further, we examine the differential enrichment of fibrillar profiles in SLI of ALS cases by TDP-43 immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM). The demonstration that pathological TDP-43 can be amyloidogenic in situ suggests the following conclusions: (1) the conformational changes associated with TDP-43 aggregation are more complex than previously thought; (2) Thioflavin-S positive SLI may be composed primarily of filamentous ultrastructures.",Acta Neuropathol,2012
22566505,Increased cerebral metabolism after 1 year of deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer disease.,"BACKGROUND: The importance of developing unique, neural circuitry-based treatments for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) was the impetus for a phase I study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with AD that targeted the fornix.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that DBS would increase cerebral glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal circuits and that increased metabolism would be correlated with better clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: Open-label trial.
SETTING: Academic medical center.
PATIENTS: A total of 5 patients with mild, probable AD (1 woman and 4 men, with a mean [SD] age of 62.6 [4.2] years).
INTERVENTION: Deep brain stimulation of the fornix.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients underwent clinical follow-up and high-resolution positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism after 1 year of DBS.
RESULTS: Functional connectivity analyses revealed that 1 year of DBS increased cerebral glucose metabolism in 2 orthogonal networks: a frontal-temporal-parietal-striatal-thalamic network and a frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital-hippocampal network. In similar cortical regions, higher baseline metabolism prior to DBS and increased metabolism after 1 year of DBS were correlated with better outcomes in global cognition, memory, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased connectivity after 1 year of DBS is observed, which is in contrast to the decreased connectivity observed over the course of AD. The persistent cortical metabolic increases after 1 year of DBS were associated with better clinical outcomes in this patient sample and are greater in magnitude and more extensive in the effects on cortical circuitry compared with the effects reported for pharmacotherapy over 1 year in AD.",Arch Neurol,2012
22710357,Distinct patterns of antiamyloid-β antibodies in typical and atypical Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare serum antiamyloid-β (Aβ) antibodies in typical and atypical Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN: Preliminary observations.
SUBJECTS: Thirteen patients with AD, 8 patients with posterior cortical atrophy with evidence of AD (PCA-AD) pathophysiological process by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and amyloid imaging, and 12 age-matched control individuals.
INTERVENTIONS: The class and subclass levels of serum anti-Aβ antibodies were measured using an oligomer-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This method allowed measuring both free antibodies and, after acidic treatment, the total fraction that includes all antibodies complexed with circulating Aβ40/42 and any cross-reacting antigen.
RESULTS: Anti-Aβ IgG were restricted to the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. Their total levels were strikingly lower and more homogeneous in patients with PCA compared with both typical AD and controls, while biomarkers of amyloid deposition (CSF Aβ42 and positron emission tomography amyloid imaging) were similar in patients with AD and patients with PCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-Aβ IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies differ between distinct forms of AD. Its significance is discussed for possible implications as immune effectors in the specific pathophysiology of AD variants.",Arch Neurol,2012
23247107,Lysine acetylation in the lumen of the ER: a novel and essential function under the control of the UPR.,"The N(ε)-amino group of lysine residues can be transiently modified by the addition of an acetyl group. Recognized functions of N(ε)-lysine acetylation include regulation of activity, molecular stabilization and conformational assembly of a protein. For more than forty years lysine acetylation was thought to occur only in the cytosol and nucleus. Targets included cytoskeletal-associated proteins as well as transcription factors, histone proteins and proteins involved in DNA recombination and repair. However, in 2007 we reported that a type I membrane protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease was transiently acetylated on the ε amino group of seven lysine residues while transiting along the secretory pathway. Surprisingly, the acetylation occurred in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forcing us to reconsider old paradigms. Indeed, if lysine acetylation can occur in the lumen of the ER, then all the essential biochemical elements of the reaction must be available in the lumen of the organelle. Follow-up studies revealed the existence of ER-based acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferases as well as a membrane transporter that translocates acetyl-CoA from the cytosol into the ER lumen. Large-scale proteomics showed that the list of substrates of the ER-based acetylation machinery includes both transiting and resident proteins. Finally, genetic studies revealed that this machinery is tightly linked to human diseases. Here, we describe these exciting findings as well as recent biochemical and cellular advances, and discuss possible impact on both human physiology and pathology.",Biochim Biophys Acta,2012
22865056,"Genome-wide pathway analysis of memory impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort implicates gene candidates, canonical pathways, and networks.","Memory deficits are prominent features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The genetic architecture underlying these memory deficits likely involves the combined effects of multiple genetic variants operative within numerous biological pathways. In order to identify functional pathways associated with memory impairment, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis on genome-wide association data from 742 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. A composite measure of memory was generated as the phenotype for this analysis by applying modern psychometric theory to item-level data from the ADNI neuropsychological test battery. Using the GSA-SNP software tool, we identified 27 canonical, expertly-curated pathways with enrichment (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05) against this composite memory score. Processes classically understood to be involved in memory consolidation, such as neurotransmitter receptor-mediated calcium signaling and long-term potentiation, were highly represented among the enriched pathways. In addition, pathways related to cell adhesion, neuronal differentiation and guided outgrowth, and glucose- and inflammation-related signaling were also enriched. Among genes that were highly-represented in these enriched pathways, we found indications of coordinated relationships, including one large gene set that is subject to regulation by the SP1 transcription factor, and another set that displays co-localized expression in normal brain tissue along with known AD risk genes. These results 1) demonstrate that psychometrically-derived composite memory scores are an effective phenotype for genetic investigations of memory impairment and 2) highlight the promise of pathway analysis in elucidating key mechanistic targets for future studies and for therapeutic interventions.",Brain Imaging Behav,2012
22963265,Biomarker positive and negative subjects in the ADNI cohort: clinical characterization.,"BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was created to develop standards for brain imaging and biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment trials. Using the ADNI dataset, experts have found that low cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 (CSF Aβ1-42) concentration and high total-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio are highly predictive of progression in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and recommended these biomarkers to support the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease and select patients for clinical trials. However, biomarker selection criteria may introduce systematic bias that undermines their utility.
METHODS: We tested for systematic biases among individuals undergoing lumbar puncture in the ADNI dataset who fulfilled the following entry criteria: (1) aMCI with CSF Aβ1-42 ≤ 192 pG/mL, compared to aMCI with Aβ1-42 > 192 pG/mL, and (2) aMCI with total-tau/Aβ1-42 > 0.39, compared to aMCI with total-tau/Aβ1-42 ≤ 0.39, as well as comparisons between participants with aMCI with and without lumbar puncture.
FINDINGS: Individuals with low CSF Aβ1-42 scored significantly poorer than individuals with high Aβ1-42 on several baseline measures of disease severity, including Logical Memory II (3.24 vs 4.73; p < 0.001), Functional Activities Questionnaire (4.30 vs 2.37; p < 0.001), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (12.23 vs 10.09; p=0.002). Similar results were found using high total-tau/Aβ1-42. No differences were found for individuals with and without lumbar puncture except for marital status.
INTERPRETATIONS: Individuals with aMCI with low Aβ1-42 in the ADNI dataset appear to have more advanced disease than those with high Aβ1-42. Selection criteria based on ADNI, as well as design of future studies, must account for potential confounds between biomarker status and disease severity to ensure that the former, and not the latter, is the true determinant of predictive accuracy.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2012
22492996,"Mitochondria-targeted catalase reduces abnormal APP processing, amyloid β production and BACE1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: implications for neuroprotection and lifespan extension.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant catalase (MCAT) and lifespan extension in mice that express amyloid beta (Aβ). Using immunoblotting and immunostaining analyses, we measured the production of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP), soluble APPα, C-terminal fragments CTF99 and CTF83, monomeric and oligomeric Aβ, Aβ deposits and beta site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), in different stages of disease progression in MCAT/AβPP and AβPP mice. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining analyses, we studied the expression of catalase, BACE1, the Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers, synaptophysin, APP, neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme and transthyretin in MCAT, AβPP, MCAT/AβPP and wild-type (WT) mice. Using the high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, we measured oxidative DNA damage in the cerebral cortical tissues from MCAT, AβPP, MCAT/AβPP and WT mice. We found that the AβPP transgenic mice that carried the human MCAT gene lived 5 months longer than did the AβPP mice. We also found that the overexpression of MCAT in the brain sections from the MCAT/AβPP transgenic mice significantly correlated with a reduction in the levels of full-length APP, CTF99, BACE1, Aβ levels (40 and 42), Aβ deposits and oxidative DNA damage relative to the brain sections from the AβPP mice. Interestingly, we found significantly increased levels of soluble APPα and CTF83 in the MCAT/AβPP mice, relative to the AβPP mice. These data provide direct evidence that oxidative stress plays a primary role in AD etiopathology and that in MCAT mice express Aβ, MCAT prevents abnormal APP processing, reduces Aβ levels and enhances Aβ-degrading enzymes in mice at different ages, corresponding to different stages of disease progression. These findings indicate that mitochondria-targeted molecules may be an effective therapeutic approach to treat patients with AD.",Hum Mol Genet,2012
22865875,Alzheimer's disease in a dish: promises and challenges of human stem cell models.,"Human pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into disease-relevant cell types, which capture the unique genome of an individual patient and provide insight into pathological mechanisms of human disease. Recently, human stem cell models for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative dementia, have been described. Stem cell-derived neurons from patients with familial and sporadic AD and Down's syndrome recapitulate human disease phenotypes such as amyloid β peptide production, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and endosomal abnormalities. Treatment of human neurons with small molecules can modulate these phenotypes, demonstrating the utility of this system for drug development and screening. This review will highlight the current AD stem cell models and discuss the remaining challenges and potential future directions of this field.",Hum Mol Genet,2012
23257288,Dual effects of increased glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity on adult neurogenesis.,"Adult neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons during the adulthood, is a process controlled by several kinases and phosphatases among which GSK3β exerts important functions. This protein is particularly abundant in the central nervous system, and its activity deregulation is believed to play a key role in chronic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported that in vivo overexpression of GSK3β (Tet/GSK3β mice) causes alterations in adult neurogenesis, leading to a depletion of the neurogenic niches. Here, we have further characterized those alterations, finding a delay in the switching-off of doublecortin marker as well as changes in the survival and death rates of immature precursors and a decrease in the total number of mature neurons. Besides, we have highlighted the importance of the inflammatory environment, identifying eotaxin as a possible modulator of the detrimental effects on adult neurogenesis. Taking advantage of the conditional system, we have also explored whether these negative consequences of increasing GSK3 activity are susceptible to revert after doxycycline treatment. We show that transgene shutdown in symptomatic mice reverts microgliosis, abnormal eotaxin levels as well as the aforementioned alterations concerning immature neurons. Unexpectedly, the decrease in the number of mature neurons and neuronal precursor cells of the subgranular zone of Tet/GSK3β mice could not be reverted. Thus, alterations in adult neurogenesis and likely in neurodegenerative disorders can be restored in part, although neurogenic niche depletion represents a non-reversible damage persisting during lifetime with a remarkable impact in adult mature neurons.",Hum Mol Genet,2012
22504421,Common variants at 12q14 and 12q24 are associated with hippocampal volume.,"Aging is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume that are accelerated by Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of <4.0 × 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 × 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 × 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 × 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 × 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.",Nat Genet,2012
22801501,A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.,"The prevalence of dementia in the Western world in people over the age of 60 has been estimated to be greater than 5%, about two-thirds of which are due to Alzheimer's disease. The age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer's disease nearly doubles every 5 years after age 65, leading to a prevalence of greater than 25% in those over the age of 90 (ref. 3). Here, to search for low-frequency variants in the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) gene with a significant effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease, we studied coding variants in APP in a set of whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. We found a coding mutation (A673T) in the APP gene that protects against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease. This substitution is adjacent to the aspartyl protease β-site in APP, and results in an approximately 40% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides in vitro. The strong protective effect of the A673T substitution against Alzheimer's disease provides proof of principle for the hypothesis that reducing the β-cleavage of APP may protect against the disease. Furthermore, as the A673T allele also protects against cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease, the two may be mediated through the same or similar mechanisms.",Nature,2012
23273599,Cortical atrophy and hypoperfusion in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed distinct patterns of cortical atrophy and hypoperfusion in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between these in vivo imaging measures and the corresponding underlying pathophysiological changes, however, remains elusive. Recently, attention has turned to neuroimaging of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in which imaging-pathological correlations can be readily performed. In this study, anatomical and arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging scans of amyloid precursor protein transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice were acquired at 3, 12, and 18 months of age. Fully-automated image processing methods were used to derive quantitative measures of cortical thickness and perfusion. These studies revealed increased regional cortical thickness in young transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-type mice. However, the transgenic mice generally demonstrated a greater rate of cortical thinning over 15 months. Cortical perfusion was significantly reduced in young transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type mice across most brain regions. Previously unreported regional genotype differences and age-related changes in cortical thickness and cerebral perfusion were identified in amyloid precursor protein transgenic and wild-type mice.",Neurobiol Aging,2012
23266749,KIBRA gene variants are associated with synchronization within the default-mode and executive control networks.,"Genetic variation at the KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism has been linked to episodic memory, executive function, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are related to the structural and functional integrity of the default-mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). We hypothesize that the KIBRA polymorphism could modulate the structure and function of the DMN and ECN in healthy young subjects, which might underlie the association between this gene and cognitive function. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the resting-state synchronization in the DMN and ECN in 288 young, healthy Chinese Han subjects. We found that carriers of the KIBRA C-allele demonstrated an increased synchronization in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of the DMN and in the right anterior insula, bilateral caudate nuclei, and bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortices (dACC) of the ECN compared to individuals with a TT genotype. Moreover, KIBRA C-allele carriers also showed a smaller gray matter volume (GMV) in the MPFC and bilateral dACCs than TT individuals. In contrast, there were no significant genotype differences in the synchronization of either the visual network or the sensorimotor network. These findings suggest that the polymorphism in the KIBRA gene affects GMV and the function of the DMN and ECN. This increased synchronization is likely a reflection of compensation for the regional gray matter deficits in these networks in young healthy subjects. The association between KIBRA polymorphisms and the DMN and ECN should be further explored in a healthy older population and in patients with AD.",Neuroimage,2012
23255825,Naturally occurring α-synuclein autoantibody levels are lower in patients with Parkinson disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers are required for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in Parkinson disease (PD). To date, most studies have concentrated on α-synuclein (α-Syn), a protein involved in Parkinson disease pathogenesis, as a potential biomarker, with inconsistent outcomes. Recently, naturally occurring autoantibodies against α-Syn (α-Syn-nAbs) have been detected in the serum of patients with PD. They represent a putative diagnostic marker for PD.
METHODS: We established and validated an ELISA to quantify α-Syn-nAbs in serum samples. We analyzed serum samples from 62 patients with PD, 46 healthy controls (HC), and 42 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) using this newly established ELISA. Additionally, serum levels of endogenous α-Syn were measured.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in α-Syn-nAbs levels between the investigated groups (p = 0.005; Kruskal-Wallis test). Levels of α-Syn-nAbs were significantly lower in patients with PD compared to HC (p < 0.05; Dunn multiple comparison post hoc test) or patients with AD (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we detected no difference between patients with AD and HC. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for patients with PD vs. HC were 85% and 25%, respectively. The α-Syn-nAbs levels did not correlate with age, Hoehn & Yahr status, or duration of disease. Endogenous α-Syn had no influence on α-Syn-nAbs levels in sera.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a well-validated assay, we detected reduced α-Syn-nAbs levels in patients with PD compared to patients with AD and HC. The assay did not achieve criteria for use as a diagnostic tool to reliably distinguish PD from HC. Further studies are needed to assess α-Syn-nAbs as a biomarker in PD.",Neurology,2012
23233682,Effects of early-life adversity on cognitive decline in older African Americans and whites.,"OBJECTIVES: Early-life adversity is related to adult health in old age but little is known about its relation with cognitive decline.
METHODS: Participants included more than 6,100 older residents (mean age = 74.9 [7.1] years; 61.8% African American) enrolled in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a geographically defined, population-based study of risk factors for Alzheimer disease. Participants were interviewed at approximately 3-year intervals for up to 16 years. The interview included a baseline evaluation of early-life adversity, and administration of 4 brief cognitive function tests to assess change in cognitive function. We estimated the relation of early-life adversity to rate of cognitive decline in a series of mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: In models stratified by race, and adjusted for age and sex, early-life adversity was differentially related to decline in African Americans and whites. Whereas no measure of early-life adversity related to cognitive decline in whites, both food deprivation and being thinner than average in early life were associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in African Americans. The relations were not mediated by years of education and persisted after adjustment for cardiovascular factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Markers of early-life adversity had an unexpected protective effect on cognitive decline in African Americans.",Neurology,2012
23255822,Differential effect of APOE genotype on amyloid load and glucose metabolism in AD dementia.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 dose and in vivo distributions of both fibrillary amyloid burden and glucose metabolism in the same Alzheimer disease dementia patients, selected for abnormal amyloid imaging.
METHODS: Twenty-two APOE ε4 negative, 40 heterozygous, and 22 homozygous Alzheimer disease dementia patients underwent dynamic (90 minutes) [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and static [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans. Parametric nondisplaceable binding potential images of [(11)C]PIB and standardized uptake value ratio images of [(18)F]FDG were generated using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue. Frontal, parietal, temporal, posterior cingulate, and occipital cortices were selected as regions of interest.
RESULTS: Multivariate general linear models with adjustment for age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination showed main effects of APOE ε4 dose on distributions of both [(11)C]PIB (p for trend <0.05) and [(18)F]FDG (p for trend <0.01). More specifically, a univariate general linear model of individual regions showed increased [(11)C]PIB binding in frontal cortex of APOE ε4 noncarriers compared with APOE ε4 carriers (p < 0.05). In contrast, APOE ε4 carriers had reduced [(18)F]FDG uptake in occipital cortex (p < 0.05) and a borderline significant effect in posterior cingulate (p = 0.07) in a dose-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: We found a reversed APOE ε4 dose effect for amyloid deposition in the frontal lobe, whereas APOE ε4 carriership was associated with more profound metabolic impairment in posterior parts of the cortex. These findings suggest that APOE genotype has a differential effect on the distribution of amyloid plaques and glucose metabolism. This may have important implications for emerging therapies that aim to directly intervene in the disease process.",Neurology,2012
23236292,Integrative analysis of a cross-loci regulation network identifies App as a gene regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic islets.,"Complex diseases result from molecular changes induced by multiple genetic factors and the environment. To derive a systems view of how genetic loci interact in the context of tissue-specific molecular networks, we constructed an F2 intercross comprised of >500 mice from diabetes-resistant (B6) and diabetes-susceptible (BTBR) mouse strains made genetically obese by the Leptin(ob/ob) mutation (Lep(ob)). High-density genotypes, diabetes-related clinical traits, and whole-transcriptome expression profiling in five tissues (white adipose, liver, pancreatic islets, hypothalamus, and gastrocnemius muscle) were determined for all mice. We performed an integrative analysis to investigate the inter-relationship among genetic factors, expression traits, and plasma insulin, a hallmark diabetes trait. Among five tissues under study, there are extensive protein-protein interactions between genes responding to different loci in adipose and pancreatic islets that potentially jointly participated in the regulation of plasma insulin. We developed a novel ranking scheme based on cross-loci protein-protein network topology and gene expression to assess each gene's potential to regulate plasma insulin. Unique candidate genes were identified in adipose tissue and islets. In islets, the Alzheimer's gene App was identified as a top candidate regulator. Islets from 17-week-old, but not 10-week-old, App knockout mice showed increased insulin secretion in response to glucose or a membrane-permeant cAMP analog, in agreement with the predictions of the network model. Our result provides a novel hypothesis on the mechanism for the connection between two aging-related diseases: Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes.",PLoS Genet,2012
23272070,Sequence variants of toll like receptor 4 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been related to inflammation and beta-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. No study has explored the association between haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) of TLR4 and AD risk previously and ApoE e4 status alone showed low sensitivity in identifying late-onset AD (LOAD) patients.
METHODS: A total of 269 LOAD patients were recruited from three hospitals in northern Taiwan (2007-2010). Controls (n = 449) were recruited from elderly health checkup and volunteers of the hospital during the same period of time. Five common (frequency≥5%) TLR4 htSNPs were selected to assess the association between TLR4 polymorphisms and the risk of LOAD in the Chinese ethnic population.
RESULTS: Homozygosity of TLR4 rs1927907 was significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD [TT vs. CC: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-4.64]. After stratification, the association increased further in ApoE e4 non-carriers (AOR = 3.07) and in hypertensive patients (AOR = 3.60). Haplotype GACGG was associated with a decreased risk of LOAD (1 vs. 0 copies: AOR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.36-0.96; 2 vs. 0 copies: AOR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14-0.67) in ApoE e4 non-carriers. ApoE e4 status significantly modified this association (p(interaction) = 0.01). These associations remained significant after correction for multiple tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequence variants of TLR4 were associated with an increased risk of LOAD, especially in ApoE e4 non-carriers and in hypertensive patients. The combination of TLR4 rs1927907 and ApoE e4 significantly increased the screening sensitivity in identifying LOAD patients from 0.4 to 0.7.",PLoS One,2012
23300797,Different patterns of white matter degeneration using multiple diffusion indices and volumetric data in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer patients.,"Alzheimeŕs disease (AD) represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline in old age. In its early stages, AD is associated with microstructural abnormalities in white matter (WM). In the current study, multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and brain volumetric measurements were employed to comprehensively investigate the landscape of AD pathology. The sample comprised 58 individuals including cognitively normal subjects (controls), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients. Relative to controls, both MCI and AD subjects showed widespread changes of anisotropic fraction (FA) in the corpus callosum, cingulate and uncinate fasciculus. Mean diffusivity and radial changes were also observed in AD patients in comparison with controls. After controlling for the gray matter atrophy the number of regions of significantly lower FA in AD patients relative to controls was decreased; nonetheless, unique areas of microstructural damage remained, e.g., the corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculus. Despite sample size limitations, the current results suggest that a combination of secondary and primary degeneration occurrs in MCI and AD, although the secondary degeneration appears to have a more critical role during the stages of disease involving dementia.",PLoS One,2012
23251365,Genetic variants in the Fat and Obesity Associated (FTO) gene and risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed that polymorphisms in the Fat and Obesity-Associated (FTO) gene have robust effects on obesity, obesity-related traits and endophenotypes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We used 1,877 Caucasian cases and controls from the NIA-LOAD study and 1,093 Caribbean Hispanics to further explore the association of FTO with AD. Using logistic regression, we assessed 42 SNPs in introns 1 and 2, the region previously reported to be associated with AD endophenotypes, which had been derived by genome-wide screenings. In addition, we performed gene expression analyses of neuropathologically confirmed AD cases and controls of two independent datasets (19 AD cases, 10 controls; 176 AD cases, 188 controls) using within- and between-group factors ANOVA of log(10) transformed rank invariant normalized expression data.
RESULTS: In the NIALOAD study, one SNP was significantly associated with AD and three additional markers were close to significance (rs6499640, rs10852521, rs16945088, rs8044769, FDR p-value: 0.05<p<0.09). Two of the SNPs are in strong LD (D'>0.9) with the previously reported SNPs. In the Caribbean Hispanic dataset, we identified three SNPs (rs17219084, rs11075996, rs11075997, FDR p-value: 0.009<p<0.01) that were associated with AD. These results were confirmed by haplotype analyses and in a metaanalysis in which we included the ADNI dataset. FTO had a significantly lower expresssion in AD cases compared to controls in two independent datasets derived from human cortex and amygdala tissue, respectively (p = 2.18 × 10-5 and p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the notion that genetic variation in Introns 1 and 2 of the FTO gene may contribute to AD risk.",PLoS One,2012
24269268,Impact of harmonization of collection tubes on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze differences in biomarker outcomes before and after harmonization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection tubes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.
METHODS: We analyzed data from French memory centers that switched from different CSF collection tubes to a common one. A total of 1966 patients were included in the study. CSF concentrations of β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) were measured in each center using the same commercial enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The diagnostic value of CSF biomarkers according to the type of tube used was then assessed using different cutoffs.
RESULTS: The predictive value of Aβ42 was highly affected by the type of collection tube used. The optimal cutoff value for p-tau181 appeared not to be affected by the type of collection tube whereas that of total tau was slightly changed. New optimal cutoff values were then computed.
CONCLUSIONS: In a routine clinical environment, the selection of the collection tube and biomarker cutoff value makes a major difference in AD biological diagnosis. The use of a common collection tube among different centers will reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and incorrect patient stratification.",Alzheimers Dement,2013
24406251,Memantine for Lewy body disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether memantine is more efficacious in several outcomes and safer than placebo in patients with Lewy body disorders, we performed a meta-analysis of memantine in patients with Lewy body disorders.
METHODS: The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials of memantine for Lewy body disorders in all patients with Lewy body disorders. Motor function, activities of daily living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini-Mental State Exam, discontinuation rate, and individual side effects were evaluated.
RESULTS: No significant effects of memantine on motor function scores, Mini-Mental State Exam scores, Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, and activity of daily living scores were found. However, memantine was superior to placebo in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change scores (standardized mean difference: -0.26; 95% confidence interval: -0.51 to -0.02; z = 2.08; p = 0.04; two studies; N = 258). Dropout due to all causes, inefficacy, or adverse events were similar in both groups. Moreover, no significant differences in serious adverse events, somnolence/tiredness, stroke, dizziness/vertigo, and confusion were found between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that memantine did not have a benefit for the treatment of Lewy body disorders in cognition and motor function. However, memantine may be superior to placebo for the overall impression of the disorders. Further, memantine is well tolerated.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,2013
24319000,Chemical structure informing statistical hypothesis testing in metabolomics.,"MOTIVATION: Metabolomics has been shown as an effective tool to study various biological and biomedical phenotypes, whereas interrogating the inherently noisy metabolite concentration data with limited sample size remains a major challenge. Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolites' structures are relevant to their bioactivities.
RESULTS: We present a new strategy to boost the statistical power of hypothesis testing in metabolomics by incorporating quantitative molecular descriptors for each metabolite. The strategy selects potentially informative summary molecular descriptors and outputs chemical structure-informed false discovery rates. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by both simulation studies and a real application. In a metabolomic study on Alzheimer's disease, the posterior inclusion probability for summary molecular descriptors reaches 0.97. By incorporating the structure data, our approach uniquely identifies multiple Alzheimer's disease signatures, which are consistent with existing evidence. These results evidently suggest the value of the proposed approach for metabolomic hypothesis-testing problems.

In a landmark shift, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration now proposes to approve prophylaxis that alters the trajectory of what is now believed to be typical AD biomarker evolution. The first prevention trials are now beginning in patients with genetic guarantees for or high genetic risks for AD. The expectation is that clues to their outcomes will begin to emerge from these trials in approximately 2018. In the meantime, new strategies point to nonneuronal cells and to system pathology.

23690254,Posterior cortical atrophy and Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analytic review of neuropsychological and brain morphometry studies.,"This paper presents the first systematic review and meta-analysis of neuropsychological and brain morphometry studies comparing posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) to typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD). Literature searches were conducted for brain morphometry and neuropsychological studies including a PCA and a tAD group. Compared to healthy controls (HC), PCA patients exhibited significant decreases in temporal, occipital and parietal gray matter (GM) volumes, whereas tAD patients showed extensive left temporal atrophy. Compared to tAD patients, participants with PCA showed greater GM volume reduction in the right occipital gyrus extending to the posterior lobule. In addition, PCA patients showed less GM volume loss in the left parahippocampal gyrus and left hippocampus than tAD patients. PCA patients exhibit significantly greater impairment in Immediate Visuospatial Memory as well as Visuoperceptual and Visuospatial Abilities than patients with tAD. However, tAD patients showed greater impairment in Delayed Auditory/Verbal Memory than patients with PCA. PCA is characterized by significant atrophy of the occipital and parietal regions and severe impairments in visuospatial functioning.",Brain Imaging Behav,2013

23978990,Evidence of recessive Alzheimer disease loci in a Caribbean Hispanic data set: genome-wide survey of runs of homozygosity.,"IMPORTANCE The search for novel Alzheimer disease (AD) genes or pathologic mutations within known AD loci is ongoing. The development of array technologies has helped to identify rare recessive mutations among long runs of homozygosity (ROHs), in which both parental alleles are identical. Caribbean Hispanics are known to have an elevated risk for AD and tend to have large families with evidence of inbreeding. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the late-onset AD in a Caribbean Hispanic population might be explained in part by the homozygosity of unknown loci that could harbor recessive AD risk haplotypes or pathologic mutations. DESIGN We used genome-wide array data to identify ROHs (&gt;1 megabase) and conducted global burden and locus-specific ROH analyses. SETTING A whole-genome case-control ROH study. PARTICIPANTS A Caribbean Hispanic data set of 547 unrelated cases (48.8% with familial AD) and 542 controls collected from a population known to have a 3-fold higher risk of AD vs non-Hispanics in the same community. Based on a Structure program analysis, our data set consisted of African Hispanic (207 cases and 192 controls) and European Hispanic (329 cases and 326 controls) participants. EXPOSURE Alzheimer disease risk genes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the total and mean lengths of the ROHs per sample. Global burden measurements among autosomal chromosomes were investigated in cases vs controls. Pools of overlapping ROH segments (consensus regions) were identified, and the case to control ratio was calculated for each consensus region. We formulated the tested hypothesis before data collection. RESULTS In total, we identified 17 137 autosomal regions with ROHs. The mean length of the ROH per person was significantly greater in cases vs controls (P = .0039), and this association was stronger with familial AD (P = .0005). Among the European Hispanics, a consensus region at the EXOC4 locus was significantly associated with AD even after correction for multiple testing (empirical P value 1 [EMP1], .0001; EMP2, .002; 21 AD cases vs 2 controls). Among the African Hispanic subset, the most significant but nominal association was observed for CTNNA3, a well-known AD gene candidate (EMP1, .002; 10 AD cases vs 0 controls). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that ROHs could significantly contribute to the etiology of AD. Future studies would require the analysis of larger, relatively inbred data sets that might reveal novel recessive AD genes. The next step is to conduct sequencing of top significant loci in a subset of samples with overlapping ROHs.",JAMA Neurol,2013
25383391,PARP1 gene variation and microglial activity on [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 PET in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation is one pathophysio-logical mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have identifiedan association between the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene and AD. This gene encodes a protein that is involved in many biological functions, including DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, and is a mediator of inflammation. Therefore, we performed a targeted genetic association analysis to investigate the relationship between the PARP1 polymorphisms and brain micro-glial activity as indexed by [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET). Participants were 26 non-Hispanic Caucasians in the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS). PET data were intensity-normalized by injected dose/total body weight. Average PBR standardized uptake values (SUV) from 6 bilateral regions of interest (thalamus, frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices, and whole brain gray matter) were used as endophenotypes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 20% minor allele frequency that were within +/- 20 kb of the PARP1 gene were included in the analyses. Gene-level association analyses were performed using a dominant genetic model with translocator protein (18-kDa) (TSPO) genotype, age at PET scan, and gender as covariates. Analyses were performed with and without APOE ε4 status as a covariate. Associations with PBR SUVs from thalamus and cingulate were significant at corrected p&lt;0.014 and &lt;0.065, respectively. Subsequent multi-marker analysis with cingulate PBR SUV showed that individuals with the ""C"" allele at rs6677172 and ""A"" allele at rs61835377 had higher PBR SUV than individuals without these alleles (corrected P&lt;0.03), and individuals with the ""G"" allele at rs6677172 and ""G"" allele at rs61835377 displayed the opposite trend (corrected P&lt;0.065). A previous study with the same cohort showed an inverse relationship between PBR SUV and brain atrophy at a follow-up visit, suggesting possible protective effect of microglial activity against cortical atrophy. Interestingly, all 6 AD and 2 of 3 LMCI participants in the current analysis had one or more copies of the ""GG"" allele combination, associated with lower cingulate PBR SUV, suggesting that this gene variant warrants further investigation.",Multimodal Brain Image Anal (2013),2013

24368087,Role of synaptic activity in the regulation of amyloid beta levels in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides is regarded as the critical component associated with AD pathogenesis, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Recent studies suggest that synaptic activity is one of the most important factors that regulate Aβ levels. It has been found that synaptic activity facilitates APP internalization and influences APP cleavage. Glutamatergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, leptin, adrenergic, orexin, and gamma-amino butyric acid receptors, as well as the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) are all involved in these processes. The present review summarizes the evidence for synaptic activity-modulated Aβ levels and the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Interestingly, the immediate early gene product Arc may also be the downstream signaling molecule of several receptors in the synaptic activity-modulated Aβ levels. Elucidating how Aβ levels are regulated by synaptic activity may provide new insights in both the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and in the development of therapies to slow down the progression of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2013
24411290,Age-related decline in white matter integrity in a mouse model of tauopathy: an in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging study.,"Elevated expression of human hyperphosphorylated tau is associated with neuronal loss and white matter (WM) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. Using in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) at 11.1 Tesla we measured age-related alterations in WM diffusion anisotropy indices in a mouse model of human tauopathy (rTg4510) and nontransgenic (nonTg) control mice at the age of 2.5, 4.5, and 8 months. Similar to previous DT-MRI studies in AD subjects, 8-month-old rTg4510 mice showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in WM structures than nonTg. The low WM FA in rTg4510 mice was observed in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, fimbria, and internal capsule and was associated with a higher radial diffusivity than nonTg. Interestingly, rTg4510 mice showed lower estimates for the mode of anisotropy than controls at 2.5 months suggesting that changes in this diffusivity metric are detectable at an early stage preceding severe tauopathy. Immunogold electron microscopy partly supports our diffusion tensor imaging findings. At the age of 4 months, rTg4510 mice show axonal tau inclusions and unmyelinated processes. At later ages (12 months and 14 months) we observed inclusions in myelin sheath, axons, and unmyelinated processes, and a ""disorganized"" pattern of myelinated fiber arrangement with enlarged inter-axonal spaces in rTg4510 but not in nonTg mice. Our data support a role for the progression of tau pathology in reduced WM integrity measured by DT-MRI. Further in vivo DT-MRI studies in the rTg4510 mouse should help better discern the detailed mechanisms of reduced FA and anisotropy mode, and the specific role of tau during neurodegeneration.",Neurobiol Aging,2013
24439478,H63D mutation in hemochromatosis alters cholesterol metabolism and induces memory impairment.,"The H63D variant of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, when expressed in carriers of the apolipoprotein E4 allele, is implicated as a risk factor for earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the hypothesis that like expression of apolipoprotein E4, expression of H63D-HFE disrupts cholesterol metabolism contributing to an increase in neurodegeneration and memory deficits. Analysis of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to stably express either wild type- (WT) or H63D-HFE indicated about a 50% reduction in cholesterol content in cells expressing H63D-HFE. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, and a significant increase in expression of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. Consistent with these studies, H67D-HFE (orthologous to human H63D-HFE) knock-in mice, showed a greater age dependent decline in brain cholesterol than WT-HFE animals and changes in expression of proteins regulating cholesterol metabolism. Brains of aged H67D-HFE mice also exhibited a significant decrease in expression of synapse proteins and a significant increase in caspase-3 expression relative to WT-HFE controls. H67D-HFE mice also had a greater reduction in brain volume and poorer recognition and spatial memory than WT-HFE mice, symptoms associated with AD. These results indicate that the alterations in cholesterol metabolism associated with expression of H63D-HFE may contribute to the development of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2013
24378088,Right hemisphere role in cognitive reserve.,"High levels of education, occupational complexity, and/or premorbid intelligence are associated with lower levels of cognitive impairment than would be expected from a given brain pathology. This has been observed across a range of conditions including Alzheimer's disease (Roe et al., 2010), stroke (Ojala-Oksala et al., 2012), traumatic brain injury (Kesler et al., 2003), and penetrating brain injury (Grafman, 1986). This cluster of factors, which seemingly protect the brain from expressing symptoms of damage, has been termed ""cognitive reserve"" (Stern, 2012). The current review considers one possible neural network, which may contribute to cognitive reserve. Based on the evidence that the neurotransmitter, noradrenaline mediates cognitive reserve's protective effects (Robertson, 2013) this review identifies the neurocognitive correlates of noradrenergic (NA) activity. These involve a set of inter-related cognitive processes (arousal, sustained attention, response to novelty, and awareness) with a strongly right hemisphere, fronto-parietal localization, along with working memory, which is also strongly modulated by NA. It is proposed that this set of processes is one plausible candidate for partially mediating the protective effects of cognitive reserve. In addition to its biological effects on brain structure and function, NA function may also facilitate networks for arousal, novelty, attention, awareness, and working memory, which collectively provide for a set of additional, cognitive, mechanisms that help the brain adapt to age-related changes and disease. It is hypothesized that to the extent that the lateral surface of the right prefrontal lobe and/or the right inferior parietal lobe maintain structural (white and gray matter) and functional integrity and connectivity, cognitive reserve should benefit and behavioral expression of pathologic damage should thus be mitigated.",Neurobiol Aging,2013
24368089,Golgin-84-associated Golgi fragmentation triggers tau hyperphosphorylation by activation of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase.,"Tau hyperphosphorylation is a critical event in Alzheimer's disease, in which the neuronal Golgi fragmentation occurs earlier than tau hyperphosphorylation. However, the intrinsic link between Golgi impairment and tau pathology is missing. By electron microscopy and western blotting, we observed in the present study that the neuronal Golgi fragmentation was increased age-dependently with a correlated tau hyperphosphorylation in the brains of C57BL/6 mice aged from 4 to 16 months. Simultaneously, golgin-84 and Golgi reassembly stacking protein 65, 2 important Golgi matrix proteins, were decreased in the brains of elder mice. Further studies in HEK293/tau cells showed that Golgi-disturbing agents, brefeldin A and nocodazole induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Knockdown of golgin-84, not Golgi reassembly stacking protein 65, by small interfering RNA was sufficient to induce tau hyperphosphorylation, while over-expressing golgin-84 arrested the brefeldin A-induced Golgi fragmentation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were activated after golgin-84 knockdown, and simultaneous inhibition of these kinases abolished the golgin-84 deficit-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest Golgi fragmentation could be an upstream event triggering tau hyperphosphorylation through golgin-84 deficit-induced activation of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase.",Neurobiol Aging,2013
24267647,The pathobiology of vascular dementia.,"Vascular cognitive impairment defines alterations in cognition, ranging from subtle deficits to full-blown dementia, attributable to cerebrovascular causes. Often coexisting with Alzheimer's disease, mixed vascular and neurodegenerative dementia has emerged as the leading cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Central to the disease mechanism is the crucial role that cerebral blood vessels play in brain health, not only for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, but also for the trophic signaling that inextricably links the well-being of neurons and glia to that of cerebrovascular cells. This review will examine how vascular damage disrupts these vital homeostatic interactions, focusing on the hemispheric white matter, a region at heightened risk for vascular damage, and on the interplay between vascular factors and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, preventative and therapeutic prospects will be examined, highlighting the importance of midlife vascular risk factor control in the prevention of late-life dementia.",Neuron,2013
23341039,CREB regulates the expression of neuronal glucose transporter 3: a possible mechanism related to impaired brain glucose uptake in Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired brain glucose uptake and metabolism precede the appearance of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD). Neuronal glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) is decreased in AD brain and correlates with tau pathology. However, what leads to the decreased GLUT3 is yet unknown. In this study, we found that the promoter of human GLUT3 contains three potential cAMP response element (CRE)-like elements, CRE1, CRE2 and CRE3. Overexpression of CRE-binding protein (CREB) or activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase significantly increased GLUT3 expression. CREB bound to the CREs and promoted luciferase expression driven by human GLUT3-promoter. Among the CREs, CRE2 and CRE3 were required for the promotion of GLUT3 expression. Full-length CREB was decreased and truncation of CREB was increased in AD brain. This truncation was correlated with calpain I activation in human brain. Further study demonstrated that calpain I proteolysed CREB at Gln28-Ala29 and generated a 41-kDa truncated CREB, which had less activity to promote GLUT3 expression. Importantly, human brain GLUT3 was correlated with full-length CREB positively and with activation of calpain I negatively. These findings suggest that overactivation of calpain I caused by calcium overload proteolyses CREB, resulting in a reduction of GLUT3 expression and consequently impairing glucose uptake and metabolism in AD brain.",Nucleic Acids Res,2013
24339941,Electrophysiological correlates of amnestic mild cognitive impairment in a simon task.,"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents a prodromal stage of Alzheimer`s disease (AD), especially when additional cognitive domains are affected (Petersen et al., 2009). Thus, single-domain amnestic MCI (sdaMCI) and multiple-domain-amnestic MCI (mdaMCI) biomarkers are important for enabling early interventions to help slow down progression of the disease. Recording event-related potentials (ERPs) is a non-invasive and inexpensive measure of brain activity associated with cognitive processes, and it is of interest from a clinical point of view. The ERP technique may also be useful for obtaining early sdaMCI and mdaMCI biomarkers because ERPs are sensitive to impairment in processes that are not manifested at behavioral or clinical levels. In the present study, EEG activity was recorded in 25 healthy participants and 30 amnestic MCI patients (17 sdaMCI and 13 mdaMCI) while they performed a Simon task. The ERPs associated with visuospatial (N2 posterior-contralateral - N2pc -) and motor (lateralized readiness potential - LRP -) processes were examined. The N2pc amplitude was smaller in participants with mdaMCI than in healthy participants, which indicated a decline in the correlates of allocation of attentional resources to the target stimulus. In addition, N2pc amplitude proved to be a moderately good biomarker of mdaMCI subtype (0.77 sensitivity, 0.76 specificity). However, the LRP amplitude was smaller in the two MCI groups (sdaMCI and mdaMCI) than in healthy participants, revealing a reduction in the motor resources available to execute the response in sdaMCI and mdaMCI patients. Furthermore, the LRP amplitude proved to be a valid biomarker (0.80 sensitivity, 0.92 specificity) of both amnestic MCI subtypes.",PLoS One,2013
24260488,Epistatic genetic effects among Alzheimer's candidate genes.,"BACKGROUND: Novel risk variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified and replicated in genome-wide association studies. Recent work has begun to address the relationship between these risk variants and biomarkers of AD, though results have been mixed. The aim of the current study was to characterize single marker and epistatic genetic effects between the top candidate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to amyloid deposition.
METHODS: We used a combined dataset across ADNI-1 and ADNI-2, and looked within each dataset separately to validate identified genetic effects. Amyloid was quantified using data acquired by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with (18)F-AV-45.
RESULTS: Two SNP-SNP interactions reached significance when correcting for multiple comparisons, BIN1 (rs7561528, rs744373) x PICALM (rs7851179). Carrying the minor allele in BIN1 was related to higher levels of amyloid deposition, however only in non-carriers of the protective PICALM minor allele.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous research suggesting these candidate SNPs do not show single marker associations with amyloid pathology. However, we provide evidence for a novel interaction between PICALM and BIN1 in relation to amyloid deposition. Risk related to the BIN1 minor allele appears to be mitigated in the presence of the PICALM protective variant. In that way, variance in amyloid plaque burden can be better classified within the context of a complex genetic background. Efforts to model cumulative risk for AD should explicitly account for this epistatic effect, and future studies should explicitly test for such effects whenever statistically feasible.",PLoS One,2013
24278327,Tau causes synapse loss without disrupting calcium homeostasis in the rTg4510 model of tauopathy.,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of tau are one of the defining hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are closely associated with neuronal degeneration. Although it has been suggested that calcium dysregulation is important to AD pathogenesis, few studies have probed the link between calcium homeostasis, synapse loss and pathological changes in tau. Here we test the hypothesis that pathological changes in tau are associated with changes in calcium by utilizing in vivo calcium imaging in adult rTg4510 mice that exhibit severe tau pathology due to over-expression of human mutant P301L tau. We observe prominent dendritic spine loss without disruptions in calcium homeostasis, indicating that tangles do not disrupt this fundamental feature of neuronal health, and that tau likely induces spine loss in a calcium-independent manner.",PLoS One,2013
24386372,Investigating the association of ApoE genotypes with blood-brain barrier dysfunction measured by cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio in a cohort of patients with different types of dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Since more than a decade ApoE is known to be a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, molecular pathways mediating this risk are still unclear. In recent years it has been hypothesized that ApoE might play a role in the disintegration of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the present study we addressed the question if ApoE genotypes might be associated with BBB function measured by albumin ratio (QAlb) in a large cohort of patients with different types of dementia.
METHODS: Five hundred twenty (520) patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD, n = 350), Alzheimer's disease (n = 71) and cerebral small vessel disease (n = 99) were assessed for their ApoE genotype. BBB function was measured in all patients using QAlb and was compared between ApoE genotypes. Dominant and additive genetic models were assumed in order to investigate the potential effect of ApoE on BBB function.
RESULTS: We observed no systematic differences in QAlb between ApoE genotypes within the present study. Increased QAlb levels were shown for those without E3 allele in the subgroup of CJD patients when assuming a dominant genetic model (p = 0.035). This could not be confirmed for patients with other forms of dementia (p = 0.234).
DISCUSSION: Although there was some evidence for a protective effect of E3 alleles in CJD patients, this study does not support the hypothesis of a systematic role of ApoE genotypes in BBB function in individuals with a diagnosis of dementia. Thus, changes in BBB function do not seem to contribute to the increased risk of cognitive decline associated with certain ApoE genotypes. The interpretation of the results of this study must take into account that BBB function was only assessed by measuring QAlb which has been shown to be a good marker for overall BBB integrity but might not reflect all qualities of the barrier.",PLoS One,2013
24376644,Turnover of C99 is controlled by a crosstalk between ERAD and ubiquitin-independent lysosomal degradation in human neuroglioma cells.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the buildup of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) aggregates derived from proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Amyloidogenic cleavage of APP by β-secretase/BACE1 generates the C-terminal fragment C99/CTFβ that can be subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to produce Aβ. Growing evidence indicates that high levels of C99/CTFβ are determinant for AD. Although it has been postulated that γ-secretase-independent pathways must control C99/CTFβ levels, the contribution of organelles with degradative functions, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or lysosomes, is unclear. In this report, we investigated the turnover and amyloidogenic processing of C99/CTFβ in human H4 neuroglioma cells, and found that C99/CTFβ is localized at the Golgi apparatus in contrast to APP, which is mostly found in endosomes. Conditions that localized C99/CTFβ to the ER resulted in its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner that first required polyubiquitination, consistent with an active role of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) in this process. Furthermore, when proteasomal activity was inhibited C99/CTFβ was degraded in a chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive compartment, implicating lysosomes as alternative sites for its degradation. Our results highlight a crosstalk between degradation pathways within the ER and lysosomes to avoid protein accumulation and toxicity.",PLoS One,2013
24348898,Identification of unstable network modules reveals disease modules associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is associated with aging, and it leads to neuron death. Deposits of amyloid β and aberrantly phosphorylated tau protein are known as pathological hallmarks of AD, but the underlying mechanisms have not yet been revealed. A high-throughput gene expression analysis previously showed that differentially expressed genes accompanying the progression of AD were more down-regulated than up-regulated in the later stages of AD. This suggested that the molecular networks and their constituent modules collapsed along with AD progression. In this study, by using gene expression profiles and protein interaction networks (PINs), we identified the PINs expressed in three brain regions: the entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HIP) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Dividing the expressed PINs into modules, we examined the stability of the modules with AD progression and with normal aging. We found that in the AD modules, the constituent proteins, interactions and cellular functions were not maintained between consecutive stages through all brain regions. Interestingly, the modules were collapsed with AD progression, specifically in the EC region. By identifying the modules that were affected by AD pathology, we found the transcriptional regulation-associated modules that interact with the proteasome-associated module via UCHL5 hub protein, which is a deubiquitinating enzyme. Considering PINs as a system made of network modules, we found that the modules relevant to the transcriptional regulation are disrupted in the EC region, which affects the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",PLoS One,2013
24386081,Is the cerebellum the optimal reference region for intensity normalization of perfusion MR studies in early Alzheimer's disease?,"The cerebellum is the region most commonly used as a reference when normalizing the intensity of perfusion images acquired using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. In addition, the cerebellum provides unbiased estimations with nuclear medicine techniques. However, no reports confirm the cerebellum as an optimal reference region in MRI studies or evaluate the consequences of using different normalization regions. In this study, we address the effect of using the cerebellum, whole-brain white matter, and whole-brain cortical gray matter in the normalization of cerebral blood flow (CBF) parametric maps by comparing patients with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), patients with AD and healthy controls. According to our results, normalization by whole-brain cortical gray matter enables more sensitive detection of perfusion abnormalities in AD patients and reveals a larger number of affected regions than data normalized by the cerebellum or whole-brain white matter. Therefore, the cerebellum is not the most valid reference region in MRI studies for early stages of AD. After normalization by whole-brain cortical gray matter, we found a significant decrease in CBF in both parietal lobes and an increase in CBF in the right medial temporal lobe. We found no differences in perfusion between patients with stable MCI and healthy controls either before or after normalization.",PLoS One,2013
24324753,Bayesian network analysis reveals alterations to default mode network connectivity in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with abnormal functioning of the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity (FC) changes to the DMN have been found in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which is the prodromal stage of AD. However, whether or not aMCI also alters the effective connectivity (EC) of the DMN remains unknown. We employed a combined group independent component analysis (ICA) and Bayesian network (BN) learning approach to resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from 17 aMCI patients and 17 controls, in order to establish the EC pattern of DMN, and to evaluate changes occurring in aMCI. BN analysis demonstrated heterogeneous regional convergence degree across DMN regions, which were organized into two closely interacting subsystems. Compared to controls, the aMCI group showed altered directed connectivity weights between DMN regions in the fronto-parietal, temporo-frontal, and temporo-parietal pathways. The aMCI group also exhibited altered regional convergence degree in the right inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, we found EC changes in DMN regions in aMCI were correlated with regional FC levels, and the connectivity metrics were associated with patients' cognitive performance. This study provides novel sights into our understanding of the functional architecture of the DMN and adds to a growing body of work demonstrating the importance of the DMN as a mechanism of aMCI.",PLoS One,2013
23982627,Peripheral and central nervous system inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in man by the novel inhibitor ABT-384.,"ABT-384 is a potent, selective inhibitor of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD-1). One milligram of ABT-384 daily fully inhibited hepatic HSD-1. Establishing the dose that fully inhibits central nervous system (CNS) HSD-1 would enable definitive clinical studies in potential CNS indications. [9,11,12,12-(2)H4] cortisol (D4 cortisol), a stable labeled tracer, was used to characterize HSD-1 inhibition by ABT-384. D4 cortisol and its products were measured in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy male volunteers during D4 cortisol infusions, for up to 40 h after five daily doses of 1-50 mg ABT-384. Similar procedures were conducted in control subjects who received no ABT-384. Peripheral HSD-1 inhibition was calculated from plasma levels of D4 cortisol and its products. CNS HSD-1 inhibition was characterized from plasma and CSF levels of D4 cortisol and its products. ABT-384 regimens ≥2 mg daily maintained peripheral HSD-1 inhibition ≥88%. ABT-384 1 mg daily maintained peripheral HSD-1 inhibition ≥81%. No CNS formation of D3 cortisol (the mass-labeled product of HSD-1) was detected following ABT-384 ≥2 mg daily, indicating full CNS HSD-1 inhibition by these regimens. Partial CNS HSD-1 inhibition was associated with 1 mg ABT-384 daily. CNS HSD-1 inhibition was characterized by strong hysteresis and increased with maximum post-dose plasma concentration of ABT-384 and its active metabolites. ABT-384 has a wide potential therapeutic window for potential indications including Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder.

25534025,Neuropathology and biochemistry of Aβ and its aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid plaques and intraneuronal τ aggregation usually associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Both β-amyloid plaques and CAA deposits contain fibrillar aggregates of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Aβ plaques and CAA develop first in neocortical areas of preclinical AD patients and, then, expand in a characteristic sequence into further brain regions with end-stage pathology in symptomatic AD patients. Aβ aggregates are not restricted to amyloid plaques and CAA. Soluble and several types of insoluble non-plaque- and non-CAA-associated Aβ aggregates have been described. Amyloid fibrils are products of a complex self-assembly process that involves different types of transient intermediates. Amongst these intermediate species are protofibrils and oligomers. Different variants of Aβ peptides may result from alternative processing or from mutations that lead to rare forms of familial AD. These variants can exhibit different self-assembly and aggregation properties. In addition, several post-translational modifications of Aβ have been described that result, for example, in the production of N-terminal truncated Aβ with pyroglutamate modification at position 3 (AβN3pE) or of Aβ phosphorylated at serine 8 (pSer8Aβ). Both AβN3pE and pSer8Aβ show enhanced aggregation into oligomers and fibrils. However, the earliest detectable soluble and insoluble Aβ aggregates in the human brain exhibit non-modified Aβ, whereas AβN3pE and pSer8Aβ are detected in later stages. This finding indicates the existence of different biochemical stages of Aβ aggregate maturation with pSer8Aβ being related mainly to cases with symptomatic AD. The conversion from preclinical to symptomatic AD could thereby be related to combined effects of increased Aβ concentration, maturation of aggregates and spread of deposits into additional brain regions. Thus, the inhibition of Aβ aggregation and maturation before entering the symptomatic stage of the disease as indicated by the accumulation of pSer8Aβ may represent an attractive treatment strategy for preventing disease progression.",Acta Neuropathol,2014
25499535,The transitional association between β-amyloid pathology and regional brain atrophy.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. The functional form to model the association between Aβ and regional brain atrophy has not been well defined. To determine the relationship between Aβ and atrophy, we compared the performance of the usual dichotomization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ to identify subjects as Aβ+ and Aβ- with a trilinear spline model of CSF Aβ.
METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 108 cognitively normal controls with baseline CSF Aβ and up to 4 years of longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed using mixed-effects regression. Piecewise-linear splines were used to evaluate the nonlinear nature of the association between CSF Aβ and regional atrophy and to identify points of acceleration of atrophy with respect to Aβ. Several parameterizations of CSF Aβ were compared using likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion. Periods of acceleration of atrophy in which subjects transition from CSF Aβ negativity to CSF Aβ positivity were estimated from the spline models and tested for significance.
RESULTS: Spline models resulted in better fits for many temporal and parietal regions compared with the dichotomous models. The trilinear model showed that periods of acceleration of atrophy varied greatly by region with early changes seen in the insula, amygdala, precuneus, hippocampus, and other temporal regions, occurring before the clinical threshold for CSF Aβ positivity.
DISCUSSION: The use of piecewise-linear splines provides an improved model of the nonlinear association between CSF Aβ and regional atrophy in regions implicated in the progression of AD. The important biological finding of this work is that some brain regions show periods of accelerated volume loss well before the CSF Aβ42 threshold. This implies that signs of brain atrophy develop before the current conventional definition of ""preclinical AD"".",Alzheimers Dement,2014
25457431,The influence of biological and technical factors on quantitative analysis of amyloid PET: Points to consider and recommendations for controlling variability in longitudinal data.,"In vivo imaging of amyloid burden with positron emission tomography (PET) provides a means for studying the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's and related diseases. Measurement of subtle changes in amyloid burden requires quantitative analysis of image data. Reliable quantitative analysis of amyloid PET scans acquired at multiple sites and over time requires rigorous standardization of acquisition protocols, subject management, tracer administration, image quality control, and image processing and analysis methods. We review critical points in the acquisition and analysis of amyloid PET, identify ways in which technical factors can contribute to measurement variability, and suggest methods for mitigating these sources of noise. Improved quantitative accuracy could reduce the sample size necessary to detect intervention effects when amyloid PET is used as a treatment end point and allow more reliable interpretation of change in amyloid burden and its relationship to clinical course.",Alzheimers Dement,2014
25510384,Carotid plaque as a predictor of dementia in older adults: the Three-City Study.,"BACKGROUND: The contribution of carotid atherosclerosis to incident dementia remains unclear. We examined the association between carotid plaques (CP) and common carotid intima media thickness (CCA-IMT) with incident dementia and its subtypes, and their added value for dementia risk prediction.
METHODS: At baseline, 6025 dementia-free subjects aged 65-86 years underwent bilateral carotid ultrasonography measures of CP and plaque-free CCA-IMT. Subjects were followed-up over 7 years for the detection of dementia.
RESULTS: After a mean 5.4 years of follow-up, 421 subjects developed dementia including 272 Alzheimer's disease and 83 vascular/mixed dementia (VaD). Only CP were independently related to VaD (HR(≥2 sites with plaques) = 1.92; 95% confidence interval or CI = 1.13-3.22) and improved VaD risk prediction (continuous Net Reclassification Index = 30.1%; 95% CI = 8.4-51.7) beyond known dementia risk factors. Accounting for stroke or competing risk by death marginally modified the results.
CONCLUSION: In older adults, CP are independent predictors of incident VaD and may improve VaD risk prediction.",Alzheimers Dement,2014
25443857,The Centiloid Project: standardizing quantitative amyloid plaque estimation by PET.,"Although amyloid imaging with PiB-PET ([C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography), and now with F-18-labeled tracers, has produced remarkably consistent qualitative findings across a large number of centers, there has been considerable variability in the exact numbers reported as quantitative outcome measures of tracer retention. In some cases this is as trivial as the choice of units, in some cases it is scanner dependent, and of course, different tracers yield different numbers. Our working group was formed to standardize quantitative amyloid imaging measures by scaling the outcome of each particular analysis method or tracer to a 0 to 100 scale, anchored by young controls (≤ 45 years) and typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The units of this scale have been named ""Centiloids."" Basically, we describe a ""standard"" method of analyzing PiB PET data and then a method for scaling any ""nonstandard"" method of PiB PET analysis (or any other tracer) to the Centiloid scale.",Alzheimers Dement,2014
25449530,Transcranial direct current stimulation in mild cognitive impairment: Behavioral effects and neural mechanisms.,"INTRODUCTION: The long preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease provides opportunities for potential disease-modifying interventions in prodromal stages such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (anodal-tDCS), with its potential to enhance neuroplasticity, may allow improving cognition in MCI.
METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, sham-controlled study, anodal-tDCS was administered to the left inferior frontal cortex during task-related and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess its impact on cognition and brain functions in MCI.
RESULTS: During sham stimulation, MCI patients produced fewer correct semantic-word-retrieval responses than matched healthy controls, which was associated with hyperactivity in bilateral prefrontal regions. Anodal-tDCS significantly improved performance to the level of controls, reduced task-related prefrontal hyperactivity and resulted in ""normalization"" of abnormal network configuration during resting-state fMRI.
DISCUSSION: Anodal-tDCS exerts beneficial effects on cognition and brain functions in MCI, thereby providing a framework to test whether repeated stimulation sessions may yield sustained reversal of cognitive deficits.",Alzheimers Dement,2014
25458308,Independent comparison of CogState computerized testing and a standard cognitive battery with neuroimaging.,"BACKGROUND: Inexpensive, non-invasive tools for assessing Alzheimer-type pathophysiologies are needed. Computerized cognitive assessments are prime candidates.
METHODS: Cognitively normal participants, aged 51-71, with magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), amyloid PET, CogState computerized cognitive assessment, and standard neuropsychological tests were included. We first examined the association between the CogState battery and neuroimaging measures. We then compared that association to the one between standard neuropsychological z-scores and neuroimaging.
RESULTS: Slower reaction times for CogState Identification and One Back, and lower memory and attention z-scores, were associated (P < .05) with FDG-PET hypometabolism. Slower time on the Groton Maze Learning Task and worse One Card Learning accuracy were associated (P < .05) with smaller hippocampal volumes. There were no associations with amyloid PET. Associations of CogState and neuropsychological Z-scores with neuroimaging were small and of a similar magnitude.
CONCLUSIONS: CogState subtests were cross-sectionally comparable to standard neuropsychological tests in their relatively weak associations with neurodegeneration imaging markers.",Alzheimers Dement,2014
25621016,"Expression of one important chaperone protein, heat shock protein 27, in neurodegenerative diseases.","INTRODUCTION: Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by accumulations of misfolded proteins that can colocalise with chaperone proteins (for example, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)), which might act as modulators of protein aggregation.
METHODS: The role of HSP27 in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and motor neuron disease (MND) was investigated. We used immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis to determine the distribution and amount of this protein in the frontal and temporal cortices of diseased and control subjects.
RESULTS: HSP27 immunostaining presented as accumulations of granules within neuronal and glial cell perikarya. Patients with AD and FTLD were affected more often, and showed greater immunostaining for HSP27, than patients with MND and controls. In FTLD, there was no association between HSP27 and histological type. The neuropathological changes of FTLD, AD and MND were not immunoreactive to HSP27. Western blot analysis revealed higher HSP27 expression in FTLD than in controls, but without qualitative differences in banding patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of HSP27 immunostaining observed may reflect the extent of ongoing neurodegeneration in affected brain areas and is not specific to FTLD, AD or MND. It may represent an accumulation of misfolded, damaged or unwanted proteins, awaiting or undergoing degradation.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2014
24933580,Frontoparietal cognitive control of verbal memory recall in Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Episodic memory retrieval is reliant upon cognitive control systems, of which 2 have been identified with functional neuroimaging: a cingulo-opercular salience network (SN) and a frontoparietal executive network (EN). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathology is distributed throughout higher-order cortices. The hypotheses were that this frontoparietal pathology would impair activity associated with verbal memory recall; and that central cholinesterase inhibition (ChI) would modulate this, improving memory recall.
METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study normal participants and 2 patient groups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Activity within the EN and SN was observed during free recall of previously heard sentences, and related to measures of recall accuracy.
RESULTS: In normal subjects, trials with reduced recall were associated with greater activity in both the SN and EN. Better recall was associated with greater activity in medial regions of the default mode network. By comparison, AD patients showed attenuated responses in both the SN and EN compared with either controls or MCI patients, even after recall performance was matched between groups. Following ChI, AD patients showed no modulation of activity within the SN, but increased activity within the EN. There was also enhanced activity within regions associated with episodic and semantic memory during less successful recall, requiring greater cognitive control.
INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that in AD, impaired responses of cognitive control networks during verbal memory recall are partly responsible for reduced recall performance. One action of symptom-modifying treatment is partially to reverse the abnormal function of frontoparietal cognitive control and temporal lobe memory networks.",Ann Neurol,2014
24462919,New perspectives on the role of tau in Alzheimer's disease. Implications for therapy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias constitute a major public health issue due to an increasingly aged population as a consequence of generally improved medical care and demographic changes. Current drug treatment of AD, the most prevalent dementia, with cholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA antagonists have demonstrated very modest, symptomatic efficacy, leaving an unmet medical need for new, more effective therapies. While drug development efforts in the last two decades have primarily focused on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, so far with disappointing results, tau-based strategies have received little attention until recently despite that the presence of extensive tau pathology is central to the disease. The discovery of mutations within the tau gene that cause fronto-temporal dementia demonstrated that tau dysfunction, in the absence of amyloid pathology, was sufficient to cause neuronal loss and clinical dementia. Abnormal levels and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein have been reported to be the underlying cause of a group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as 'tauopathies'. The detrimental consequence is the loss of affinity between this protein and the microtubules, increased production of fibrillary aggregates and the accumulation of insoluble intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. However, it has become clear in recent years that tau is not only a microtubule interacting protein, but rather has additional roles in cellular processes. This review focuses on emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at treating the underlying causes of the tau pathology in tauopathies and AD, including some novel approaches on the verge of providing new treatment paradigms within the coming years.",Biochem Pharmacol,2014
25452431,α-Synuclein modifies mutant huntingtin aggregation and neurotoxicity in Drosophila.,"Protein misfolding and aggregation is a major hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Until recently, the consensus was that each aggregation-prone protein was characteristic of each disorder [α-synuclein (α-syn)/PD, mutant huntingtin (Htt)/HD, Tau and amyloid beta peptide/AD]. However, growing evidence indicates that aggregation-prone proteins can actually co-aggregate and modify each other's behavior and toxicity, suggesting that this process may also contribute to the overlap in clinical symptoms across different diseases. Here, we show that α-syn and mutant Htt co-aggregate in vivo when co-expressed in Drosophila and produce a synergistic age-dependent increase in neurotoxicity associated to a decline in motor function and life span. Altogether, our results suggest that the co-existence of α-syn and Htt in the same neuronal cells worsens aggregation-related neuropathologies and accelerates disease progression.",Hum Mol Genet,2014

25329012,Quantifying the eating abnormalities in frontotemporal dementia.,"IMPORTANCE: Presence of eating abnormalities is one of the core criteria for the diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), yet their occurrence in other subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and effect on metabolic health is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To define and quantify patterns of eating behavior and energy, sugar, carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake, as well as indices of metabolic health in patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia (SD) compared with patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and healthy control participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective case-controlled study involving patient and caregiver completion of surveys. Seventy-five participants with dementia (21 with bvFTD, 26 with SD, and 28 with AD) and 18 age- and education-matched healthy controls were recruited from FRONTIER, the FTD research clinic at Neuroscience Research Australia in Sydney.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Caregivers of patients with FTD and AD completed validated questionnaires on appetite, eating behaviors, energy consumption, and dietary macronutrient composition. All participants completed surveys on hunger and satiety. Body mass index and weight measurements were prospectively collected.
RESULTS: The bvFTD group had significant abnormalities in the domains of appetite (U = 111.0, z = 2.7, P = .007), eating habits (U = 69.5, z = 3.8, P = .001), food preferences (U = 57.0, z = 4.1, P = .001), swallowing (U = 109.0, z = 3.0, P = .003), and other oral behaviors (U = 141.0, z = 2.6, P = .009) compared with the AD group. The bvFTD and SD groups tended to have increased energy consumption. Compared with controls, the bvFTD group had significantly increased carbohydrate intake (251 vs 170 g/d; P = .05) and the SD group had significantly increased sugar intake (114 vs 76 g/d; P = .049). No significant differences in total fat or protein intake between the groups were found. Despite similar energy intake, the SD group had lower hunger and satiety scores compared with the bvFTD group. In contrast, hunger and satiety scores did not differ between the bvFTD group and controls. The abnormal eating behavior was found in the 2 groups (bvFTD and SD) with the highest body mass index (F = 4.2, P = .008) and waist circumference (F = 6.4, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Abnormal eating behaviors are prominent in patients with bvFTD and those with SD and are not limited to increased appetite. The observed higher intake of sugar and carbohydrates was found in patients with the FTD subtypes and those with higher body mass index and waist circumference and was not explained simply by increased hunger or lower satiety.",JAMA Neurol,2014
24794346,The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: a versatile model for the study of proteotoxicity and aging.,"Toxicity arising from protein misfolding and aggregation (proteotoxicity) is tightly mechanistically linked to the emergence of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Why these maladies manifest in late stages of life and what mechanisms protect the young organism from disease are key enigmas. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers key advantages that enable systematic exploration of many cell biological and functional aspects of neurodegeneration-linked proteotoxicity. Here we review the abundantly used nematode-based proteotoxicity models and delineate common techniques for the measurement of protein aggregation and rate of proteotoxicity. We also discuss the advantages offered by the worm for genetic screening, drug development and for the exploration of the links between proteotoxicity and the aging process.",Methods,2014
25326800,Cleavage of tau by asparagine endopeptidase mediates the neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of truncated and hyperphosphorylated tau, are a common feature of numerous aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms mediating tau truncation and aggregation during aging remain elusive. Here we show that asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, is activated during aging and proteolytically degrades tau, abolishes its microtubule assembly function, induces tau aggregation and triggers neurodegeneration. AEP is upregulated and active during aging and is activated in human AD brain and tau P301S-transgenic mice with synaptic pathology and behavioral impairments, leading to tau truncation in NFTs. Tau P301S-transgenic mice with deletion of the gene encoding AEP show substantially reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, less synapse loss and rescue of impaired hippocampal synaptic function and cognitive deficits. Mice infected with adeno-associated virus encoding an uncleavable tau mutant showed attenuated pathological and behavioral defects compared to mice injected with adeno-associated virus encoding tau P301S. Together, these observations indicate that AEP acts as a crucial mediator of tau-related clinical and neuropathological changes. Inhibition of AEP may be therapeutically useful for treating tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.",Nat Med,2014
25616912,Isolation and characterization of antibody fragments selective for toxic oligomeric tau.,"Oligomeric tau species are important in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as they are neurotoxic and can propagate tau-tangle pathology. Therefore, reagents that selectively recognize different key morphologies of tau are needed to help define the role of tau in AD and related diseases. We utilized a biopanning protocol that combines the binding diversity of phage-displayed antibody libraries with the powerful imaging capability of atomic force microscopy to isolate single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that selectively bind toxic oligomeric tau. We isolated 3 different antibody fragments that bind oligomeric but not monomeric or fibrillar tau. The scFvs differentiate brain tissue homogenates of both 3×TG and tau-AD mice from wild-type mice, detecting oligomeric tau at much earlier ages than when neurofibrillary tangles are typically detected. The scFvs also distinguish human postmortem AD brain tissue from cognitively normal postmortem human brain tissue, demonstrating the potential of this approach for developing biomarkers for early detection and progression of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2014
25559335,APOE ε4 moderates amyloid-related memory decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele and high levels of beta-amyloid (Aβ) are associated with episodic memory decline and risk for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is debate about independent or interactive effects of ɛ4 on Aβ-related memory decline in healthy older adults. Healthy older adults with high Aβ burden (n = 84) enrolled in Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study were included in this study. Cognition was measured using the computerized Cogstate Brief Battery at baseline, 18-, 36-, and 54-month follow-ups. Mini Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating scales were also administered at baseline and each follow-up timepoint. Relative to Aβ+ ɛ4 noncarriers (n = 36), Aβ+ ɛ4 carriers (n = 48) showed significantly faster decline on memory tasks, which was by convention, moderate in magnitude (d = 0.40-0.47). Aβ positivity coupled with APOE ɛ4 was associated with moderately increased decline in memory over a 54-month assessment period, suggesting that, in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, the manifestation of memory decline in older adults with high Aβ is exacerbated by the presence of APOE ɛ4.",Neurobiol Aging,2014
25554493,CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta/miR135a/thrombospondin 1 axis mediates PGE2-induced angiogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), large populations of endothelial cells undergo angiogenesis due to brain hypoxia and inflammation. Substantial evidence from epidemiologic, pathologic, and clinical reports suggests that vascular factors are critical for the pathogenesis of AD. However, the precise mechanistic correlation between inflammation and angiogenesis in AD has not been well elucidated. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key factor of the inflammatory response, has been known to promote angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that PGE2 acts through EP4 receptor and protein kinase A to modulate CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD) abundance in astrocytes. Attenuated vessel formation was observed in the brains of AppTg/Cebpd(-/-) mice. We showed that miR135a was responsive to the induction of CEBPD and further negatively regulated thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) transcription by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) in astrocytes. Furthermore, conditioned media from astrocytes expressing miR135a promoted Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) tube-like formation, which correlated with the effects of PGE2 on angiogenesis. Our results indicated that CEBPD contributes to the repression of THBS1 transcription by activating the expression of miR135a in astrocytes following PGE2 treatment. We provided new evidence that astrocytic CEBPD increases angiogenesis during AD pathogenesis. This discovery supports the negative influence of CEBPD activation in astrocytes with respect to AD pathogenesis and implies that the CEBPD/miR135a/THBS1 axis could be a therapeutic target of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2014
25659857,Influence of genetic variants in SORL1 gene on the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.,"We studied the association of SORL1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes with measures of pathology in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an endophenotype approach. We included (1) 133 patients from the German Dementia Competence Network (71 ± 8 years; 50% females; Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], 24 ± 3); (2) 83 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (75 ± 8 years; 45% females; MMSE, 24 ± 2); and (3) 452 patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort 66 ± 8 years; 47% females; MMSE, 20 ± 5). As endophenotype markers we used cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-beta, total tau (tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and hippocampal atrophy. We measured 19 SORL1 SNP alleles. Genotype-endophenotype associations were determined by linear regression analyses. There was an association between rs2070045-G allele and increased CSF-tau and more hippocampal atrophy. Additionally, haplotype-based analyses revealed an association between haplotype rs11218340-A/rs3824966-G/rs3824968-A and higher CSF-tau and CSF-tau phosphorylated at threonine 181. In conclusion, we found that SORL1 SNP rs2070045-G allele was related to CSF-tau and hippocampal atrophy, 2 endophenotype markers of AD, suggesting that SORL1 may be implicated in the downstream pathology in AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2014
25533426,Commentary: is Alzheimer's disease uniquely human?,"That Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be a human-specific disease was hypothesized by Rapoport in 1989. Apes and humans share an identical amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide amino acid sequence and accumulate considerable Aβ deposits after age 40 years, an age when amyloid plaques are uncommon in humans. Despite their early Aβ buildup, ape brains have not shown evidence dystrophic neurites near plaques. Aging great ape brains also have few neurofibrillary tangles, with one exception of 1 obese chimpanzee euthanized after a stroke who displayed abundant neurofibrillary tangles, but without the typical AD distribution. We discuss the need for more exacting evaluation of neuron density with age, and note husbandry issues that may allow great apes to live to greater ages. We remain reserved about expectations for fully developed AD-like pathology in the great apes of advanced ages and cautiously support Rapoport's hypothesis.",Neurobiol Aging,2014
25376662,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and essential tremor.,"BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be inversely related to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, both of which may share common mechanisms with essential tremor (ET). Use of these medications has not been studied in ET cases vs. controls.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between NSAID (esp. ibuprofen) and aspirin use and ET.
METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in a case-control study of the environmental epidemiology of ET at the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC; 2009-2014). We compared 92 ET cases to 107 controls (∼1:1 matching) in terms of self-reported NSAID (esp. ibuprofen) and aspirin use.
RESULTS: The proportion of NSAID or aspirin users (current or past) was similar in ET cases and controls (for current user, p = 0.66; for past user, p = 0.90). Among users, however, the total dosage of ibuprofen (frequency in past year × number of tablets taken at a time × typical average strength of tablets) was higher in controls than ET cases (p = 0.04). ET cases and controls did not differ with respect to aspirin use in the past year.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of NSAID or aspirin users did not differ in ET cases or controls; yet interestingly, ibuprofen use was less in ET cases than in controls. The latter raises the possibility that ibuprofen use could have a potential protective role in ET.",Neuroepidemiology,2014
25474638,Tetraspanin (TSP-17) protects dopaminergic neurons against 6-OHDA-induced neurodegeneration in C. elegans.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, is linked to the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Disease loci causing hereditary forms of PD are known, but most cases are attributable to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Increased incidence of PD is associated with rural living and pesticide exposure, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration can be triggered by neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In C. elegans, this drug is taken up by the presynaptic dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT-1) and causes selective death of the eight dopaminergic neurons of the adult hermaphrodite. Using a forward genetic approach to find genes that protect against 6-OHDA-mediated neurodegeneration, we identified tsp-17, which encodes a member of the tetraspanin family of membrane proteins. We show that TSP-17 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and provide genetic, pharmacological and biochemical evidence that it inhibits DAT-1, thus leading to increased 6-OHDA uptake in tsp-17 loss-of-function mutants. TSP-17 also protects against toxicity conferred by excessive intracellular dopamine. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that TSP-17 acts partly via the DOP-2 dopamine receptor to negatively regulate DAT-1. tsp-17 mutants also have subtle behavioral phenotypes, some of which are conferred by aberrant dopamine signaling. Incubating mutant worms in liquid medium leads to swimming-induced paralysis. In the L1 larval stage, this phenotype is linked to lethality and cannot be rescued by a dop-3 null mutant. In contrast, mild paralysis occurring in the L4 larval stage is suppressed by dop-3, suggesting defects in dopaminergic signaling. In summary, we show that TSP-17 protects against neurodegeneration and has a role in modulating behaviors linked to dopamine signaling.",PLoS Genet,2014
24586201,Molecular evidence for the inverse comorbidity between central nervous system disorders and cancers detected by transcriptomic meta-analyses.,"There is epidemiological evidence that patients with certain Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders have a lower than expected probability of developing some types of Cancer. We tested here the hypothesis that this inverse comorbidity is driven by molecular processes common to CNS disorders and Cancers, and that are deregulated in opposite directions. We conducted transcriptomic meta-analyses of three CNS disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia) and three Cancer types (Lung, Prostate, Colorectal) previously described with inverse comorbidities. A significant overlap was observed between the genes upregulated in CNS disorders and downregulated in Cancers, as well as between the genes downregulated in CNS disorders and upregulated in Cancers. We also observed expression deregulations in opposite directions at the level of pathways. Our analysis points to specific genes and pathways, the upregulation of which could increase the incidence of CNS disorders and simultaneously lower the risk of developing Cancer, while the downregulation of another set of genes and pathways could contribute to a decrease in the incidence of CNS disorders while increasing the Cancer risk. These results reinforce the previously proposed involvement of the PIN1 gene, Wnt and P53 pathways, and reveal potential new candidates, in particular related with protein degradation processes.",PLoS Genet,2014

We set out to evaluate the novel compound, [125I]WYE-230949, as a potential radionuclide imaging agent for the histamine H3 receptor in brain. [125I]WYE-230949 had a high in vitro affinity for the rat histamine H3 receptor (Kd of 6.9 nM). The regional distribution of [125I]WYE-230949 binding sites in rat brain, demonstrated by in vitro autoradiography, was consistent with the known distribution of the histamine H3 receptor. Rat brain uptake of intravenously injected [125I]WYE-230949 was low (0.11 %ID/g) and the ratio of specific: non-specific binding was less than 1.4, as determined by ex vivo autoradiography. In plasma, metabolism of [125I]WYE-230949 into a less lipophilic species occurred, such that less than 38% of the parent compound remained 30 minutes after injection. Brain uptake and metabolism of [125I]WYE-230949 were increased and specific binding was reduced in anaesthetised compared to conscious rats. [125I]WYE230949 is not a potential radiotracer for imaging rat histamine H3 receptors in vivo due to low brain uptake, in vivo metabolism of the parent compound and low specific binding.",PLoS One,2014
25247594,Are APOE ɛ genotype and TOMM40 poly-T repeat length associations with cognitive ageing mediated by brain white matter tract integrity?,"Genetic polymorphisms in the APOE ɛ and TOMM40 '523' poly-T repeat gene loci have been associated with significantly increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. This study investigated the independent effects of these polymorphisms on human cognitive ageing, and the extent to which nominally significant associations with cognitive ageing were mediated by previously reported genetic associations with brain white matter tract integrity in this sample. Most participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 completed a reasoning-type intelligence test at age 11 years, and detailed cognitive/physical assessments and structural diffusion tensor brain magnetic resonance imaging at a mean age of 72.70 years (s.d.=0.74). Participants were genotyped for APOE ɛ2/ɛ3/ɛ4 status and TOMM40 523 poly-T repeat length. Data were available from 758-814 subjects for cognitive analysis, and 522-543 for mediation analysis with brain imaging data. APOE genotype was significantly associated with performance on several different tests of cognitive ability, including general factors of intelligence, information processing speed and memory (raw P-values all<0.05), independently of childhood IQ and vascular disease history. Formal tests of mediation showed that several significant APOE-cognitive ageing associations--particularly those related to tests of information processing speed--were partially mediated by white matter tract integrity. TOMM40 523 genotype was not associated with cognitive ageing. A range of brain phenotypes are likely to form the anatomical basis for significant associations between APOE genotype and cognitive ageing, including white matter tract microstructural integrity.",Transl Psychiatry,2014

Progress to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies rests on valid and rigorous analytic approaches, but the research literature reflects little consensus on ""best practices."" We present findings from a large scientific working group on research methods for clinical and population studies of dementia, which identified five categories of methodological challenges as follows: (1) attrition/sample selection, including selective survival; (2) measurement, including uncertainty in diagnostic criteria, measurement error in neuropsychological assessments, and practice or retest effects; (3) specification of longitudinal models when participants are followed for months, years, or even decades; (4) time-varying measurements; and (5) high-dimensional data. We explain why each challenge is important in dementia research and how it could compromise the translation of research findings into effective prevention or care strategies.

26362597,Trajectories of decline in cognition and daily functioning in preclinical dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Although preclinical dementia is characterized by decline in cognition and daily functioning, little is known on their temporal sequence. We investigated trajectories of cognition and daily functioning in preclinical dementia, during 18 years of follow-up.
METHODS: In 856 dementia cases and 1712 controls, we repetitively assessed cognition and daily functioning with memory complaints, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and basic activities of daily living (BADL).
RESULTS: Dementia cases first reported memory complaints 16 years before diagnosis, followed by decline in MMSE, IADL, and finally BADL. Vascular dementia related to earlier decline in daily functioning but later in cognition, compared with Alzheimer's disease. Higher education related to larger preclinical cognitive decline, whereas apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers declined less in daily functioning.
DISCUSSION: These results emphasize the long hierarchical preclinical trajectory of functional decline in dementia. Furthermore, they show that various pathologic, environmental, and genetic factors may influence these trajectories of decline.",Alzheimers Dement,2015
26610898,Surgery is associated with ventricular enlargement as well as cognitive and functional decline.,"INTRODUCTION: In preclinical studies, surgery/anesthesia contribute to cognitive decline and enhance neuropathologic changes underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the link between surgery, anesthesia, apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4), and AD remains unclear.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of two prospective longitudinal aging studies. Mixed-effects statistical models were used to assess the relationship between surgical/anesthetic exposure, the APOE genotype, and rate of change in measures of cognition, function, and brain volumes.
RESULTS: The surgical group (n = 182) experienced a more rapid rate of deterioration compared with the nonsurgical group (n = 345) in several cognitive, functional, and brain magnetic resonance imaging measures. Furthermore, there was a significant synergistic effect of anesthesia/surgery exposure and presence of the APOE ε4 allele in the decline of multiple cognitive and functional measures.
DISCUSSION: These data provide insight into the role of surgical exposure as a risk factor for cognitive and functional decline in older adults.",Alzheimers Dement,2015
26602086,Assessing Alzheimer's disease patients' quality of life: Discrepancies between patient and caregiver perspectives.,"INTRODUCTION: Quality of life (QOL) is an important dimension to consider in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but few large-scale studies have analyzed self and caregiver reports of patient QOL.
METHODS: Patient QOL was evaluated in a cohort of 574 AD patients with the QOL-AD scale over 2 years.
RESULTS: Caregiver reports of patient QOL were lower at baseline than self reports. Older patient age was associated with overestimation of QOL by caregivers, whereas neuropsychiatric inventory score and caregiver burden were associated with underestimation. Activities of daily living limitation, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden were systematically associated with poorer QOL, whereas caregiver relationship and apathy were associated with poorer QOL only for self reports or caregiver reports, respectively. Cognitive function and professional care were not associated with QOL. Self-rated patient QOL did not change over time, whereas disease severity markers and caregiver-rated patient QOL declined.
DISCUSSION: It is important to assess both self and caregiver ratings when assessing patient QOL.",Alzheimers Dement,2015
26505992,Melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss in Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are photoreceptors driving circadian photoentrainment, and circadian dysfunction characterizes Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated mRGCs in AD, hypothesizing that they contribute to circadian dysfunction.
METHODS: We assessed retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 21 mild-moderate AD patients, and in a subgroup of 16 we evaluated rest-activity circadian rhythm by actigraphy. We studied postmortem mRGCs by immunohistochemistry in retinas, and axons in optic nerve cross-sections of 14 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients. We coimmunostained for retinal amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and melanopsin to locate mRGCs. All AD cohorts were compared with age-matched controls.
RESULTS: We demonstrated an age-related optic neuropathy in AD by OCT, with a significant reduction of RNFL thickness (p = 0.038), more evident in the superior quadrant (p = 0.006). Axonal loss was confirmed in postmortem AD optic nerves. Abnormal circadian function characterized only a subgroup of AD patients. Sleep efficiency was significantly reduced in AD patients (p = 0.001). We also found a significant loss of mRGCs in postmortem AD retinal specimens (p = 0.003) across all ages and abnormal mRGC dendritic morphology and size (p = 0.003). In flat-mounted AD retinas, Aβ accumulation was remarkably evident inside and around mRGCs.
INTERPRETATION: We show variable degrees of rest-activity circadian dysfunction in AD patients. We also demonstrate age-related loss of optic nerve axons and specifically mRGC loss and pathology in postmortem AD retinal specimens, associated with Aβ deposition. These results all support the concept that mRGC degeneration is a contributor to circadian rhythm dysfunction in AD.",Ann Neurol,2015
26338766,Learning directed acyclic graphical structures with genetical genomics data.,"MOTIVATION: Large amount of research efforts have been focused on estimating gene networks based on gene expression data to understand the functional basis of a living organism. Such networks are often obtained by considering pairwise correlations between genes, thus may not reflect the true connectivity between genes. By treating gene expressions as quantitative traits while considering genetic markers, genetical genomics analysis has shown its power in enhancing the understanding of gene regulations. Previous works have shown the improved performance on estimating the undirected network graphical structure by incorporating genetic markers as covariates. Knowing that gene expressions are often due to directed regulations, it is more meaningful to estimate the directed graphical network.
RESULTS: In this article, we introduce a covariate-adjusted Gaussian graphical model to estimate the Markov equivalence class of the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a genetical genomics analysis framework. We develop a two-stage estimation procedure to first estimate the regression coefficient matrix by [Formula: see text] penalization. The estimated coefficient matrix is then used to estimate the mean values in our multi-response Gaussian model to estimate the regulatory networks of gene expressions using PC-algorithm. The estimation consistency for high dimensional sparse DAGs is established. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical results. The method is applied to a human Alzheimer's disease dataset in which differential DAGs are identified between cases and controls. R code for implementing the method can be downloaded at http://www.stt.msu.edu/∼cui.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R code for implementing the method is freely available at http://www.stt.msu.edu/∼cui/software.html.",Bioinformatics,2015
26667277,Neuroeconomic dissociation of semantic dementia and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.,"Many neuropsychiatric disorders are marked by abnormal behaviour and decision-making, but prevailing diagnostic criteria for such behaviours are typically qualitative and often ambiguous. Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (also called semantic dementia) are two clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia with overlapping but distinct anatomical substrates known to cause profound changes in decision-making. We investigated whether abnormal decision-making in these syndromes could be more precisely characterized in terms of dissociable abnormalities in patients' subjective evaluations of valence (positive versus negative outcome) and of time (present versus future outcome). We presented 28 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 14 patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease (as disease controls), and 61 healthy older control subjects with experimental tasks assaying loss aversion and delay discounting. In general linear models controlling for age, gender, education and Mini-Mental State Examination score, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were less averse to losses than control subjects (P < 0.001), while patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia discounted delayed rewards more steeply than controls (P = 0.019). There was no relationship between loss aversion and delay discounting across the sample, nor in any of the subgroups. These findings suggest that abnormal behaviours in neurodegenerative disease may result from the disruption of either of two dissociable neural processes for evaluating the outcomes of action. More broadly, these findings suggest a role for computational methods to supplement traditional qualitative characterizations in the differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Brain,2015
25700178,Low cardiac index is associated with incident dementia and Alzheimer disease: the Framingham Heart Study.,"BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional epidemiological and clinical research suggests that lower cardiac index is associated with abnormal brain aging, including smaller brain volumes, increased white matter hyperintensities, and worse cognitive performances. Lower systemic blood flow may have implications for dementia among older adults.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1039 Framingham Offspring Cohort participants free of clinical stroke, transient ischemic attack, and dementia formed our sample (age, 69±6 years; 53% women). Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazard models adjusting for Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, cardiovascular disease history, atrial fibrillation), education, and apolipoprotein E4 status related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-assessed cardiac index (cardiac output divided by body surface area) to incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD). Over the median 7.7-year follow-up period, 32 participants developed dementia, including 26 cases of AD. Each 1-SD unit decrease in cardiac index increased the relative risk of both dementia (hazard ratio [HR]=1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.47; P=0.013) and AD (HR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.07-2.54; P=0.022). Compared with individuals with normal cardiac index, individuals with clinically low cardiac index had a higher relative risk of dementia (HR=2.07; 95% CI, 1.02-4.19; P=0.044). If participants with clinically prevalent cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation were excluded (n=184), individuals with clinically low cardiac index had a higher relative risk of both dementia (HR=2.92; 95% CI, 1.34-6.36; P=0.007) and AD (HR=2.87; 95% CI, 1.21-6.80; P=0.016) compared with individuals with normal cardiac index.
CONCLUSION: Lower cardiac index is associated with an increased risk for the development of dementia and AD.",Circulation,2015
26433932,APP overexpression in the absence of NPC1 exacerbates metabolism of amyloidogenic proteins of Alzheimer's disease.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides originating from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cellular cholesterol levels/distribution can regulate production and clearance of Aβ peptides, albeit with contradictory outcomes. To better understand the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and APP/Aβ metabolism, we have recently generated a bigenic ANPC mouse line overexpressing mutant human APP in the absence of Niemann-Pick type C-1 protein required for intracellular cholesterol transport. Using this unique bigenic ANPC mice and complementary stable N2a cells, we have examined the functional consequences of cellular cholesterol sequestration in the endosomal-lysosomal system, a major site of Aβ production, on APP/Aβ metabolism and its relation to neuronal viability. Levels of APP C-terminal fragments (α-CTF/β-CTF) and Aβ peptides, but not APP mRNA/protein or soluble APPα/APPβ, were increased in ANPC mouse brains and N2a-ANPC cells. These changes were accompanied by reduced clearance of peptides and an increased level/activity of γ-secretase, suggesting that accumulation of APP-CTFs is due to decreased turnover, whereas increased Aβ levels may result from a combination of increased production and decreased turnover. APP-CTFs and Aβ peptides were localized primarily in early-/late-endosomes and to some extent in lysosomes/autophagosomes. Cholesterol sequestration impaired endocytic-autophagic-lysosomal, but not proteasomal, clearance of APP-CTFs/Aβ peptides. Moreover, markers of oxidative stress were increased in vulnerable brain regions of ANPC mice and enhanced β-CTF/Aβ levels increased susceptibility of N2a-ANPC cells to H2O2-induced toxicity. Collectively, our results show that cellular cholesterol sequestration plays a key role in APP/Aβ metabolism and increasing neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress in AD-related pathology.",Hum Mol Genet,2015
26083568,Cerebrospinal Fluid Particles in Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease.,"Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains diverse lipid particles, including lipoproteins that are distinct from their plasma counterparts and contain apolipoprotein (apo) E isoforms, apoJ, and apoAI, and extracellular vesicles, which can be detected by annexin V binding. The aim of this study was to develop a method to quantify CSF particles and evaluate their relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We used a flow cytometric assay to detect annexin V-, apoE-, apoAI-, apoJ-, and amyloid (A) β42-positive particles in CSF from 131 research volunteers who were neurologically normal or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, or Parkinson disease. APOE ε4/ε4 participants had CSF apoE-positive particles that were more frequently larger but at an 88% lower level versus those in APOE ε3/ε3 or APOE ε3/ε4 patients; this finding was reproduced in conditioned medium from mouse primary glial cell cultures with targeted replacement of apoE. Cerebrospinal fluid apoE-positive and β-amyloid (Aβ42)-positive particle concentrations were persistently reduced one-third to one-half in middle and older age subjects; apoAI-positive particle concentration progressively increased approximately 2-fold with age. Both apoAI-positive and annexin V-positive CSF particle levels were reduced one-third to one-half in CSF of MCI and/or AD dementia patients versus age-matched controls. Our approach provides new methods to investigate CNS lipid biology in relation to neurodegeneration and perhaps develop new biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment monitoring.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2015

26389654,Association Between Atrial Fibrillation and Dementia in the General Population.,"IMPORTANCE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been suggested as a risk factor for dementia since it may lead to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and stroke. However, longitudinal studies assessing the association between AF and dementia have shown inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of AF on the risk of developing dementia during 20 years of follow-up.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The association of prevalent and incident AF with incident dementia was assessed from July 6, 1989, to February 4, 2010, in 6514 dementia-free participants in the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. Data analysis was conducted from September 18, 2014, to April 17, 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors; censored for stroke; and stratified by median age were used. In addition, we investigated whether the association between incident AF and dementia varied according to the duration of exposure, categorized in 6-year time bands.
EXPOSURES: Prevalent and incident AF.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident dementia, determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.
RESULTS: At baseline, 318 of 6514 participants (4.9%) had prevalent AF, and during 81 483 person-years of follow-up, 994 participants (15.3%) developed incident dementia. With findings presented as adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI), prevalent AF was related to an increased risk of dementia (1.33; 1.02-1.73). Among 6196 participants without prevalent AF during 79 003 person-years of follow-up, 723 participants (11.7%) developed incident AF and 932 individuals (15.0%) developed incident dementia. Incident AF was associated with an increased risk of dementia in younger participants (<67 years: 1.81; 1.11-2.94 vs ≥67 years: 1.12; 0.85-1.46; P = .02 for interaction). The risk of dementia was strongly associated with duration of exposure to AF in the younger participants (in the highest stratum: 3.30; 1.16-9.38; P = .003 for trend) but not in the elder participants (0.25; 0.04-1.86; P = .94 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of dementia, independent of clinical stroke. This association was strongest for younger participants with the longest duration of AF. Future studies should investigate whether optimal treatment of AF can prevent or postpone dementia.",JAMA Neurol,2015
26302439,Nerve Growth Factor Gene Therapy: Activation of Neuronal Responses in Alzheimer Disease.,"IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and lacks effective disease-modifying therapies. In 2001, we initiated a clinical trial of nerve growth factor (NGF) gene therapy in AD, the first effort at gene delivery in an adult neurodegenerative disorder. This program aimed to determine whether a nervous system growth factor prevents or reduces cholinergic neuronal degeneration in patients with AD. We present postmortem findings in 10 patients with survival times ranging from 1 to 10 years after treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether degenerating neurons in AD retain an ability to respond to a nervous system growth factor delivered after disease onset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients in this anatomicopathological study were enrolled in clinical trials from March 2001 to October 2012 at the University of California, San Diego, Medical Center in La Jolla. Ten patients with early AD underwent NGF gene therapy using ex vivo or in vivo gene transfer. The brains of all 8 patients in the first phase 1 ex vivo trial and of 2 patients in a subsequent phase 1 in vivo trial were examined.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brains were immunolabeled to evaluate in vivo gene expression, cholinergic neuronal responses to NGF, and activation of NGF-related cell signaling. In 2 patients, NGF protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Among 10 patients, degenerating neurons in the AD brain responded to NGF. All patients exhibited a trophic response to NGF in the form of axonal sprouting toward the NGF source. Comparing treated and nontreated sides of the brain in 3 patients who underwent unilateral gene transfer, cholinergic neuronal hypertrophy occurred on the NGF-treated side (P < .05). Activation of cellular signaling and functional markers was present in 2 patients who underwent adeno-associated viral vectors (serotype 2)-mediated NGF gene transfer. Neurons exhibiting tau pathology and neurons free of tau expressed NGF, indicating that degenerating cells can be infected with therapeutic genes, with resultant activation of cell signaling. No adverse pathological effects related to NGF were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings indicate that neurons of the degenerating brain retain the ability to respond to growth factors with axonal sprouting, cell hypertrophy, and activation of functional markers. Sprouting induced by NGF persists for 10 years after gene transfer. Growth factor therapy appears safe over extended periods and merits continued testing as a means of treating neurodegenerative disorders.",JAMA Neurol,2015

26552589,Molecular systems evaluation of oligomerogenic APP(E693Q) and fibrillogenic APP(KM670/671NL)/PSEN1(Δexon9) mouse models identifies shared features with human Alzheimer's brain molecular pathology.,"Identification and characterization of molecular mechanisms that connect genetic risk factors to initiation and evolution of disease pathophysiology represent major goals and opportunities for improving therapeutic and diagnostic outcomes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Integrative genomic analysis of the human AD brain transcriptome holds potential for revealing novel mechanisms of dysfunction that underlie the onset and/or progression of the disease. We performed an integrative genomic analysis of brain tissue-derived transcriptomes measured from two lines of mice expressing distinct mutant AD-related proteins. The first line expresses oligomerogenic mutant APP(E693Q) inside neurons, leading to the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers and behavioral impairment, but never develops parenchymal fibrillar amyloid deposits. The second line expresses APP(KM670/671NL)/PSEN1(Δexon9) in neurons and accumulates fibrillar Aβ amyloid and amyloid plaques accompanied by neuritic dystrophy and behavioral impairment. We performed RNA sequencing analyses of the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex from each line and from wild-type mice. We then performed an integrative genomic analysis to identify dysregulated molecules and pathways, comparing transgenic mice with wild-type controls as well as to each other. We also compared these results with datasets derived from human AD brain. Differential gene and exon expression analysis revealed pervasive alterations in APP/Aβ metabolism, epigenetic control of neurogenesis, cytoskeletal organization and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation. Comparative molecular analysis converged on FMR1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation 1), an important negative regulator of APP translation and oligomerogenesis in the post-synaptic space. Integration of these transcriptomic results with human postmortem AD gene networks, differential expression and differential splicing signatures identified significant similarities in pathway dysregulation, including ECM regulation and neurogenesis, as well as strong overlap with AD-associated co-expression network structures. The strong overlap in molecular systems features supports the relevance of these findings from the AD mouse models to human AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2015

27066559,Alzheimer risk genes modulate the relationship between plasma apoE and cortical PiB binding.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between apoE protein plasma levels and brain amyloidosis and the effect of the top 10 Alzheimer disease (AD) risk genes on this association.
METHODS: Our dataset consisted of 18 AD, 52 mild cognitive impairment, and 3 cognitively normal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI1) participants with available [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and peripheral blood protein data. We used cortical pattern matching to study associations between plasma apoE and cortical PiB binding and the effect of carrier status for the top 10 AD risk genes.
RESULTS: Low plasma apoE was significantly associated with high PiB SUVR, except in the sensorimotor and entorhinal cortex. For BIN1 rs744373, the association was observed only in minor allele carriers. For CD2AP rs9349407 and CR1 rs3818361, the association was preserved only in minor allele noncarriers. We did not find evidence for modulation by CLU, PICALM, ABCA7, BIN1, and MS4A6A.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that BIN1 rs744373, CD2AP rs9349407, and CR1 rs3818361 genotypes modulate the association between apoE protein plasma levels and brain amyloidosis, implying a potential epigenetic/downstream interaction.",Neurol Genet,2015
26537053,Raloxifene for women with Alzheimer disease: A randomized controlled pilot trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, improves cognitive function compared with placebo in women with Alzheimer disease (AD) and to provide an estimate of cognitive effect.
METHODS: This pilot study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with a planned treatment of 12 months. Women with late-onset AD of mild to moderate severity were randomly allocated to high-dose (120 mg) oral raloxifene or identical placebo provided once daily. The primary outcome compared between treatment groups at 12 months was change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog).
RESULTS: Forty-two women randomized to raloxifene or placebo were included in intent-to-treat analyses (mean age 76 years, range 68-84), and 39 women contributed 12-month outcomes. ADAS-cog change scores at 12 months did not differ significantly between treatment groups (standardized difference 0.03, 95% confidence interval -0.39 to 0.44, 2-tailed p = 0.89). Raloxifene and placebo groups did not differ significantly on secondary analyses of dementia rating, activities of daily living, behavior, or a global cognition composite score. Caregiver burden and caregiver distress were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Results on the primary outcome showed no cognitive benefits in the raloxifene-treated group.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that for women with AD, raloxifene does not have a significant cognitive effect. The study lacked the precision to exclude a small effect.",Neurology,2015
26173052,HHEX_23 AA Genotype Exacerbates Effect of Diabetes on Dementia and Alzheimer Disease: A Population-Based Longitudinal Study.,"BACKGROUND: Research has suggested that variations within the IDE/HHEX gene region may underlie the association of type 2 diabetes with Alzheimer disease (AD). We sought to explore whether IDE genes play a role in the association of diabetes with dementia, AD, and structural brain changes using data from two community-based cohorts of older adults and a subsample with structural MRI.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The first cohort, which included dementia-free adults aged ≥75 y (n = 970) at baseline, was followed for 9 y to detect incident dementia (n = 358) and AD (n = 271) cases. The second cohort (for replication), which included 2,060 dementia-free participants aged ≥60 y at baseline, was followed for 6 y to identify incident dementia (n = 166) and AD (n = 121) cases. A subsample (n = 338) of dementia-free participants from the second cohort underwent MRI. HHEX_23 and IDE_9 were genotyped, and diabetes (here including type 2 diabetes and prediabetes) was assessed. In the first cohort, diabetes led to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.32) and 1.66 (95% CI 1.06-2.40) for dementia and AD, respectively, among all participants. Compared to people carrying the GG genotype without diabetes, AA genotype carriers with diabetes had an adjusted HR of 5.54 (95% CI 2.40-7.18) and 4.81 (95% CI 1.88-8.50) for dementia and AD, respectively. There was a significant interaction between HHEX_23-AA and diabetes on dementia (HR 4.79, 95% CI 1.63-8.90, p = 0.013) and AD (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.45-9.91, p = 0.025) compared to the GG genotype without diabetes. In the second cohort, the HRs were 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.99) and 1.64 (1.02-2.33) for the diabetes-AD and dementia-AD associations, respectively, and 4.06 (95% CI 1.06-7.58, p = 0.039) and 3.29 (95% CI 1.02-8.33, p = 0.044) for the interactions, respectively. MRI data showed that HHEX_23-AA carriers with diabetes had significant structural brain changes compared to HHEX_23-GG carriers without diabetes. No joint effects of IDE_9 and diabetes on dementia were shown. As a limitation, the sample sizes were small for certain subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: A variant in the HHEX_23 gene interacts with diabetes to be associated with a substantially increased risk of dementia and AD, and with structural brain changes among dementia-free elderly people.",PLoS Med,2015
26683657,Multi-Shell Hybrid Diffusion Imaging (HYDI) at 7 Tesla in TgF344-AD Transgenic Alzheimer Rats.,"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is widely used to study microstructural characteristics of the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high-angular resolution imaging (HARDI) are frequently used in radiology and neuroscience research but can be limited in describing the signal behavior in composite nerve fiber structures. Here, we developed and assessed the benefit of a comprehensive diffusion encoding scheme, known as hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI), composed of 300 DWI volumes acquired at 7-Tesla with diffusion weightings at b = 1000, 3000, 4000, 8000 and 12000 s/mm2 and applied it in transgenic Alzheimer rats (line TgF344-AD) that model the full clinico-pathological spectrum of the human disease. We studied and visualized the effects of the multiple concentric ""shells"" when computing three distinct anisotropy maps-fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) and normalized quantitative anisotropy (NQA). We tested the added value of the multi-shell q-space sampling scheme, when reconstructing neural pathways using mathematical frameworks from DTI and q-ball imaging (QBI). We show a range of properties of HYDI, including lower apparent anisotropy when using high b-value shells in DTI-based reconstructions, and increases in apparent anisotropy in QBI-based reconstructions. Regardless of the reconstruction scheme, HYDI improves FA-, GFA- and NQA-aided tractography. HYDI may be valuable in human connectome projects and clinical research, as well as magnetic resonance research in experimental animals.",PLoS One,2015
27543298,What we know about TMEM106B in neurodegeneration.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 50,000 people in the United States alone. The most common pathological subtype of FTLD is the presence of ubiquitinated TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulations in frontal and temporal brain regions at autopsy. While some cases of FTLD-TDP can be attributed to the inheritance of disease-causing mutations, the majority of cases arise with no known genetic cause. In 2010, the first genome-wide association study was conducted in patients with FTLD-TDP to determine potential genetic risk factors for this homogenous subgroup of dementia patients, leading to the identification of the TMEM106B locus on chromosome 7. In this manuscript, we review the initial discovery and replication studies describing TMEM106B variants as disease risk factors and modifiers in TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as FTLD-TDP caused by progranulin (GRN) or chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutations, as well as Alzheimer's disease and hippocampal sclerosis. We further summarize what is currently known about the previously uncharacterized TMEM106B protein and its role as a potential regulator of lysosomal function, and we discuss how modifying TMEM106B levels might uncover promising therapeutic strategies for individuals suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathy.",Acta Neuropathol,2016
27752775,eEF2K inhibition blocks Aβ42 neurotoxicity by promoting an NRF2 antioxidant response.,"Soluble oligomers of amyloid-β (Aβ) impair synaptic plasticity, perturb neuronal energy homeostasis, and are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Therefore, significant efforts in AD drug discovery research aim to prevent the formation of Aβ oligomers or block their neurotoxicity. The eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, and couples neurotransmission to local dendritic mRNA translation. Recent evidence indicates that Aβ oligomers activate neuronal eEF2K, suggesting a potential link to Aβ induced synaptic dysfunction. However, a detailed understanding of the role of eEF2K in AD pathogenesis, and therapeutic potential of eEF2K inhibition in AD, remain to be determined. Here, we show that eEF2K activity is increased in postmortem AD patient cortex and hippocampus, and in the hippocampus of aged transgenic AD mice. Furthermore, eEF2K inhibition using pharmacological or genetic approaches prevented the toxic effects of Aβ42 oligomers on neuronal viability and dendrite formation in vitro. We also report that eEF2K inhibition promotes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) antioxidant response in neuronal cells, which was crucial for the beneficial effects of eEF2K inhibition in neurons exposed to Aβ42 oligomers. Accordingly, NRF2 knockdown or overexpression of the NRF2 inhibitor, Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein-1 (Keap1), significantly attenuated the neuroprotection associated with eEF2K inhibition. Finally, genetic deletion of the eEF2K ortholog efk-1 reduced oxidative stress, and improved chemotaxis and serotonin sensitivity in C. elegans expressing human Aβ42 in neurons. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential utility of eEF2K inhibition to reduce Aβ-mediated oxidative stress in AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2016
27638701,Risk factor SORL1: from genetic association to functional validation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most dramatic threats to healthy aging and devising effective treatments for this devastating condition remains a major challenge in biomedical research. Much has been learned about the molecular concepts that govern proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein to amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), and how accelerated accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ peptides underlies neuronal cell death in rare familial but also common sporadic forms of this disease. Out of a plethora of proposed modulators of amyloidogenic processing, one protein emerged as a key factor in AD pathology, a neuronal sorting receptor termed SORLA. Independent approaches using human genetics, clinical pathology, or exploratory studies in animal models all converge on this receptor that is now considered a central player in AD-related processes by many. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence implicating SORLA-mediated protein sorting in neurodegenerative processes, and how receptor gene variants in the human population impair functional receptor expression in sporadic but possibly also in autosomal-dominant forms of AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2016
26908276,Reversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Normal Cognition: A Meta-Analysis.,"The initiation of Alzheimer disease (AD) prevention studies has placed greater emphasis on the need to accurately detect individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) given their increased risk for developing AD. Several studies reporting on the incidence and prevalence of aMCI have also found that a substantial number of aMCI cases at baseline assessments revert to normal cognition at subsequent assessments. This instability presents a major challenge to intervention studies aimed at preventing the onset of clinical symptoms associated with aMCI. Reversion rates from 25 studies were used for this meta-analysis which found an overall reversion rate of approximately 24%. When the studies were separated by their setting (community vs. clinic), substantial differences in reversion rates were noted with clinic-based studies having a much lower reversion rate (14%) than community-based studies (31%). North American and European studies had high heterogeneity of reversion rates, whereas Asian studies had moderate levels of heterogeneity and significantly lower rates of reversion. Continued improvement in diagnostic and classification methodologies may help in more accurately identifying aMCI cases which are less likely to revert to normal cognition.",Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,2016

The recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary working group based on the available evidence and consensus from focused discussions for (i) identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the cause of dementia, (ii) prediction of rate of decline, (iii) cost-effectiveness, and (iv) interpretation of results. The working group found sufficient evidence to support a recommendation to use CSF AD biomarkers as a supplement to clinical evaluation, particularly in uncertain and atypical cases, to identify or exclude AD as the cause of dementia. Because of insufficient evidence, it was uncertain whether CSF AD biomarkers outperform imaging biomarkers. Operational recommendations for the interpretation of ambiguous CSF biomarker results were also provided.",Alzheimers Dement,2016
28017827,Risk of incident clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease-type dementia attributable to pathology-confirmed vascular disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The presence of cerebrovascular pathology may increase the risk of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We examined excess risk of incident clinical diagnosis of AD (probable and possible AD) posed by the presence of lacunes and large infarcts beyond AD pathology using data from the Statistical Modeling of Aging and Risk of Transition study, a consortium of longitudinal cohort studies with more than 2000 autopsies. We created six mutually exclusive pathology patterns combining three levels of AD pathology (low, moderate, or high AD pathology) and two levels of vascular pathology (without lacunes and large infarcts or with lacunes and/or large infarcts).
RESULTS: The coexistence of lacunes and large infarcts results in higher likelihood of clinical diagnosis of AD only when AD pathology burden is low.
DISCUSSION: Our results reinforce the diagnostic importance of AD pathology in clinical AD. Further harmonization of assessment approaches for vascular pathologies is required.",Alzheimers Dement,2016

METHODS: With data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, we used the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes classifications to conduct a cross-sectional analysis assessing the relationship between cognitive state and various direct and indirect costs and health care utilization patterns.
RESULTS: Patients with aMCI had less medical expenditures than patients with moderate and severe AD dementia (P < .001) and were also significantly less likely to have been hospitalized (P = .04) and admitted to nursing home (P < .001). Compared to individuals with normal cognition, patients with aMCI had significantly less household income (P = .018).
DISCUSSION: Patients with aMCI had lower medical expenditures than patients with AD dementia. Poor cognitive status was linearly associated with lower household income, higher medical expenditures, higher likelihood of nursing and home care services, and lower likelihood of outpatient visits.",Alzheimers Dement,2016
27693183,Association of blood lipids with Alzheimer's disease: A comprehensive lipidomics analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to (1) replicate previous associations between six blood lipids and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Proitsi et al 2015) and (2) identify novel associations between lipids, clinical AD diagnosis, disease progression and brain atrophy (left/right hippocampus/entorhinal cortex).
METHODS: We performed untargeted lipidomic analysis on 148 AD and 152 elderly control plasma samples and used univariate and multivariate analysis methods.
RESULTS: We replicated our previous lipids associations and reported novel associations between lipids molecules and all phenotypes. A combination of 24 molecules classified AD patients with &gt;70% accuracy in a test and a validation data set, and we identified lipid signatures that predicted disease progression (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10, test data set) and brain atrophy (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.14, all test data sets except left entorhinal cortex). We putatively identified a number of metabolic features including cholesteryl esters/triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines.
DISCUSSION: Blood lipids are promising AD biomarkers that may lead to new treatment strategies.",Alzheimers Dement,2016
27693187,Subjective cognitive decline in cognitively normal elders from the community or from a memory clinic: Differential affective and imaging correlates.,"INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) could indicate preclinical Alzheimer's disease, but the existing literature is confounded by heterogeneous approaches to studying SCD. We assessed the differential cognitive, affective, and neuroimaging correlates of two aspects of SCD: reporting high cognitive difficulties on a self-rated questionnaire versus consulting at a memory clinic.
METHODS: We compared 28 patients from a memory clinic with isolated SCD, 35 community-recruited elders with similarly high levels of self-reported cognitive difficulties, and 35 community-recruited controls with low self-reported cognitive difficulties.
RESULTS: Increased anxiety and amyloid β deposition were observed in both groups with high self-reported difficulties, whereas subclinical depression and (hippocampal) atrophy were specifically associated with medical help seeking. Cognitive tests showed no group differences.
DISCUSSION: These results further validate the concept of SCD in both community- and clinic-based groups. Yet, recruitment methods influence associated biomarkers and affective symptomatology, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of SCD depending on study characteristics.",Alzheimers Dement,2016
27133892,Hyperphosphorylation determines both the spread and the morphology of tau pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurofibrillary pathology of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Tau pathology can be experimentally induced and propagated. However, what induces the prion-like transmission character to tau and produces morphologically distinct tau lesions remains elusive.
METHODS: We investigated the role of hyperphosphorylation in the spread of tau pathology in hTau transgenic mice.
RESULTS: We found that intrahippocampal injection with AD P-tau, but not nonphosphorylated tau, produced numerous P-tau tangles and neuropil threads locally and in neocortex lateral to injection and upstream to the hippocampus. Dephosphorylation of AD P-tau with protein phosphatase-2A dramatically reduced and switched tau pathology from neurofibrillary tangles to argyrophilic grain-like morphology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau determines the spread and morphology of tau lesions and that the propagation of tau pathology takes place both locally and in axonally connected areas and highlight tau hyperphosphorylation as a potential drug target.",Alzheimers Dement,2016
27547773,Alzheimer's disease: are blood and brain markers related? A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Peripheral protein biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may help identify novel treatment avenues by allowing early diagnosis, recruitment to clinical trials, and treatment initiation. The purpose of this review was to determine which proteins have been found to be differentially expressed in the AD brain and whether these proteins are also found within the blood of AD patients.
METHODS: A two-stage approach was conducted. The first stage involved conducting a systematic search to identify discovery-based brain proteomic studies of AD. The second stage involved comparing whether proteins found to be differentially expressed in AD brain were also differentially expressed in the blood.
RESULTS: Across 11 discovery based brain proteomic studies 371 proteins were at different levels in the AD brain. Nine proteins were frequently found, defined as appearing in at least three separate studies. Of these proteins heat-shock cognate 71 kDa, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase alone were found to share a consistent direction of change, being consistently upregulated in studies they appeared in. Eighteen proteins seen as being differentially expressed within the AD brain were present in blood proteomic studies of AD. Only complement C4a was seen multiple times within both the blood and brain proteomic studies.
INTERPRETATION: We report a number of proteins appearing in both the blood and brain of AD patients. Of these proteins, C4a may be a good candidate for further follow-up in large-scale replication efforts.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2016
28097205,Impact of tau and amyloid burden on glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.,"In a multimodal PET imaging approach, we determined the differential contribution of neurofibrillary tangles (measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451) and beta-amyloid burden (measured with [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB) on degree of neurodegeneration (i.e., glucose metabolism measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Across brain regions, we observed an interactive effect of beta-amyloid burden and tau deposition on glucose metabolism which was most pronounced in the parietal lobe. Elevated beta-amyloid burden was associated with a stronger influence of tau accumulation on glucose metabolism. Our data provide the first in vivo insights into the differential contribution of Aβ and tau to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2016
27231710,Plasma neuronal exosomal levels of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in normal aging.,"Plasma neuronal exosomal levels of pathogenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteins, cellular survival factors, and lysosomal proteins distinguish AD patients from control subjects, but changes in these exosomal proteins associated with normal aging have not been described for cognitively intact subjects. Plasma neuronal exosomal levels of P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau, Aβ 1-42, cathepsin D, repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor, and neurogranin were quantified longitudinally in cognitively intact older adults using two samples collected at 3- to 11-year intervals. Except for P-S396-tau, exosomal protein levels changed significantly with aging, but were largely outside the range observed in AD patients.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2016

28185568,Identification of expression patterns in the progression of disease stages by integration of transcriptomic data.,"BACKGROUND: In the study of complex diseases using genome-wide expression data from clinical samples, a difficult case is the identification and mapping of the gene signatures associated to the stages that occur in the progression of a disease. The stages usually correspond to different subtypes or classes of the disease, and the difficulty to identify them often comes from patient heterogeneity and sample variability that can hide the biomedical relevant changes that characterize each stage, making standard differential analysis inadequate or inefficient.
RESULTS: We propose a methodology to study diseases or disease stages ordered in a sequential manner (e.g. from early stages with good prognosis to more acute or serious stages associated to poor prognosis). The methodology is applied to diseases that have been studied obtaining genome-wide expression profiling of cohorts of patients at different stages. The approach allows searching for consistent expression patterns along the progression of the disease through two major steps: (i) identifying genes with increasing or decreasing trends in the progression of the disease; (ii) clustering the increasing/decreasing gene expression patterns using an unsupervised approach to reveal whether there are consistent patterns and find genes altered at specific disease stages. The first step is carried out using Gamma rank correlation to identify genes whose expression correlates with a categorical variable that represents the stages of the disease. The second step is done using a Self Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster the genes according to their progressive profiles and identify specific patterns. Both steps are done after normalization of the genomic data to allow the integration of multiple independent datasets. In order to validate the results and evaluate their consistency and biological relevance, the methodology is applied to datasets of three different diseases: myelodysplastic syndrome, colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. A software script written in R, named genediseasePatterns, is provided to allow the use and application of the methodology.
CONCLUSION: The method presented allows the analysis of the progression of complex and heterogeneous diseases that can be divided in pathological stages. It identifies gene groups whose expression patterns change along the advance of the disease, and it can be applied to different types of genomic data studying cohorts of patients in different states.",BMC Bioinformatics,2016
27724902,Identification and differential regulation of microRNAs in response to methyl jasmonate treatment in Lycoris aurea by deep sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Lycoris aurea is a medicine-valuable and ornamental herb widely distributed in China. Former studied have showed that methyl jasmonate (MJ) treatment could increase the content of glanthamine-a worldwide medicine for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease in genus Lycoris plants. To explore the possible role of miRNAs in the regulation of jasmonic acid signaling pathway and uncover their potential correlations, we investigated the expression profiles of small RNAs (sRNAs) and their targets in Lycoris aurea, with MJ treatment by using next-generation deep sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 365 miRNAs were identified, comprising 342 known miRNAs (representing 60 miRNA families) and 23 novel miRNAs. Among them, 143 known and 11 novel miRNAs were expressed differently under MJ treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR of eight selected miRNAs validated the expression pattern of these loci in response to MJ treatment. In addition, degradome sequencing analysis showed that 32 target genes were validated to be targeted by the 49 miRNAs, respectively. Gene function and pathway analyses showed that these targets such as auxin response factors (ARFs), squamosa promoter-binding like (SPL) proteins, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 are involved in different plant processes, indicating miRNAs mediated regulation might play important roles in L. aurea response to MJ treatment. Furthermore, several L. aurea miRNAs associated with their target genes that might be involved in Amaryllidaceae alkloids biosynthehsis were also analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of miRNAs with diverse expression patterns, and complex relationships between expression of miRNAs and targets were identified. This study represents the first transcriptome-based analysis of miRNAs in Lycoris and will contribute to understanding the potential roles of miRNAs involved in regulation of MJ response.",BMC Genomics,2016
27556418,Reconstructing directed gene regulatory network by only gene expression data.,"BACKGROUND: Accurately identifying gene regulatory network is an important task in understanding in vivo biological activities. The inference of such networks is often accomplished through the use of gene expression data. Many methods have been developed to evaluate gene expression dependencies between transcription factor and its target genes, and some methods also eliminate transitive interactions. The regulatory (or edge) direction is undetermined if the target gene is also a transcription factor. Some methods predict the regulatory directions in the gene regulatory networks by locating the eQTL single nucleotide polymorphism, or by observing the gene expression changes when knocking out/down the candidate transcript factors; regrettably, these additional data are usually unavailable, especially for the samples deriving from human tissues.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose the Context Based Dependency Network (CBDN), a method that is able to infer gene regulatory networks with the regulatory directions from gene expression data only. To determine the regulatory direction, CBDN computes the influence of source to target by evaluating the magnitude changes of expression dependencies between the target gene and the others with conditioning on the source gene. CBDN extends the data processing inequality by involving the dependency direction to distinguish between direct and transitive relationship between genes. We also define two types of important regulators which can influence a majority of the genes in the network directly or indirectly. CBDN can detect both of these two types of important regulators by averaging the influence functions of candidate regulator to the other genes. In our experiments with simulated and real data, even with the regulatory direction taken into account, CBDN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for inferring gene regulatory network. CBDN identifies the important regulators in the predicted network: 1. TYROBP influences a batch of genes that are related to Alzheimer's disease; 2. ZNF329 and RB1 significantly regulate those 'mesenchymal' gene expression signature genes for brain tumors.
CONCLUSION: By merely leveraging gene expression data, CBDN can efficiently infer the existence of gene-gene interactions as well as their regulatory directions. The constructed networks are helpful in the identification of important regulators for complex diseases.",BMC Genomics,2016
27039371,GWAS and transcriptional analysis prioritize ITPR1 and CNTN4 for a serum uric acid 3p26 QTL in Mexican Americans.,"BACKGROUND: The variation in serum uric acid concentrations is under significant genetic influence. Elevated SUA concentrations have been linked to increased risk for gout, kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease whereas reduced serum uric acid concentrations have been linked to multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we identified a novel locus on chromosome 3p26 affecting serum uric acid concentrations in Mexican Americans from San Antonio Family Heart Study. As a follow up, we examined genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data in an extended cohort of 1281 Mexican Americans from multigenerational families of the San Antonio Family Heart Study and the San Antonio Family Diabetes/Gallbladder Study. We used a linear regression-based joint linkage/association test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for non-independence among family members via a kinship variance component.
RESULTS: Univariate genetic analysis indicated serum uric acid concentrations to be significant heritable (h (2) = 0.50 ± 0.05, p < 4 × 10(-35)), and linkage analysis of serum uric acid concentrations confirmed our previous finding of a novel locus on 3p26 (LOD = 4.9, p < 1 × 10(-5)) in the extended sample. Additionally, we observed strong association of serum uric acid concentrations with variants in following candidate genes in the 3p26 region; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1 (ITPR1), contactin 4 (CNTN4), decapping mRNA 1A (DCP1A); transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 26 (ARHGEF26) [p < 3 × 10(-7); minor allele frequencies ranged between 0.003 and 0.42] and evidence of cis-regulation for ITPR1 transcripts.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the importance of the chromosome 3p26 locus and genetic variants in this region in the regulation of serum uric acid concentrations.",BMC Genomics,2016
27030133,An evolutionary roadmap to the microtubule-associated protein MAP Tau.,"BACKGROUND: The microtubule associated protein Tau (MAPT) promotes assembly and interaction of microtubules with the cytoskeleton, impinging on axonal transport and synaptic plasticity. Its neuronal expression and intrinsic disorder implicate it in some 30 tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. These pathophysiological studies have yet to be complemented by computational analyses of its molecular evolution and structural models of all its functional domains to explain the molecular basis for its conservation profile, its site-specific interactions and the propensity to conformational disorder and aggregate formation.
RESULTS: We systematically annotated public sequence data to reconstruct unspliced MAPT, MAP2 and MAP4 transcripts spanning all represented genomes. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses, genetic linkage maps and domain architectures distinguished a nonvertebrate outgroup from the emergence of MAP4 and its subsequent ancestral duplication to MAP2 and MAPT. These events were coupled to other linked genes such as KANSL1L and KANSL and may thus be consequent to large-scale chromosomal duplications originating in the extant vertebrate genomes of hagfish and lamprey. Profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs), clustered subalignments and 3D structural predictions defined potential interaction motifs and specificity determining sites to reveal distinct signatures between the four homologous microtubule binding domains and independent divergence of the amino terminus.
CONCLUSION: These analyses clarified ambiguities of MAPT nomenclature, defined the order, timing and pattern of its molecular evolution and identified key residues and motifs relevant to its protein interaction properties and pathogenic role. Additional unexpected findings included the expansion of cysteine-containing, microtubule binding domains of MAPT in cold adapted Antarctic icefish and the emergence of a novel multiexonic saitohin (STH) gene from repetitive elements in MAPT intron 11 of certain primate genomes.",BMC Genomics,2016
27358062,A loss of function variant in CASP7 protects against Alzheimer's disease in homozygous APOE ε4 allele carriers.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common form of dementia in elder populations with approximately 30 million cases worldwide. Genome wide genotyping and sequencing studies have identified many genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). While most of these variants are associated with increased risk of developing LOAD, only limited number of reports focused on variants that are protective against the disease.
METHODS: Here we applied a novel approach to uncover protective alleles against AD by analyzing genetic and phenotypic data in Mount Sinai Biobank and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) databases.
RESULTS: We discovered a likely loss-of-function small deletion variant in the caspase 7 (CASP7) gene associated with significantly reduced incidence of LOAD in carriers of the high-risk APOE ε4 allele. Further investigation of four independent cohorts of European ancestry revealed the protective effect of the CASP7 variant against AD is most significant in homozygous APOE ε4 allele carriers. Meta analysis of multiple datasets shows overall odds ratio = 0.45 (p = 0.004). Analysis of RNA sequencing derived gene expression data indicated the variant correlates with reduced caspase 7 expression in multiple brain tissues we examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that caspase 7 plays a key role in microglial activation driving neuro-degeneration during AD pathogenesis, and may explain the underlying genetic mechanisms that anti-inflammatory interventions in AD show greater benefit in APOE ε4 carriers than non-carriers. Our findings inform potential novel therapeutic opportunities for AD and warrant further investigations.",BMC Genomics,2016
27875990,"Inverse relationship between Alzheimer's disease and cancer, and other factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: The AD etiology is yet not properly known. Interactions among environmental factors, multiple susceptibility genes and aging, contribute to AD. This study investigates the factors that play role in causing AD and how changes in cellular pathways contribute to AD.
METHODS: PUBMED database, MEDLINE database and Google Scholar were searched with no date restrictions for published articles involving cellular pathways with roles in cancers, cell survival, growth, proliferation, development, aging, and also contributing to Alzheimer's disease. This research explores inverse relationship between AD and cancer, also investigates other factors behind AD using several already published research literature to find the etiology of AD.
RESULTS: Cancer and Alzheimer's disease have inverse relationship in many aspects such as P53, estrogen, neurotrophins and growth factors, growth and proliferation, cAMP, EGFR, Bcl-2, apoptosis pathways, IGF-1, HSV, TDP-43, APOE variants, notch signals and presenilins, NCAM, TNF alpha, PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway, telomerase, ROS, ACE levels. AD occurs when brain neurons have weakened growth, cell survival responses, maintenance mechanisms, weakened anti-stress responses such as Vimentin, Carbonic anhydrases, HSPs, SAPK. In cancer, these responses are upregulated and maintained. Evolutionarily conserved responses and maintenance mechanisms such as FOXO are impaired in AD. Countermeasures or compensatory mechanisms by AD affected neurons such as Tau, Beta Amyloid, S100, are last attempts for survival which may be protective for certain time, or can speed up AD in Alzheimer's microenvironment via C-ABL activation, GSK3, neuro-inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease and Cancer have inverse relationship; many factors that are upregulated in any cancer to sustain growth and survival are downregulated in Alzheimer's disease contributing to neuro-degeneration. When aged neurons or genetically susceptible neurons have weakened growth, cell survival and anti-stress responses, age related gene expression changes, altered regulation of cell death and maintenance mechanisms, they contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Countermeasures by AD neurons such as Beta Amyloid Plaques, NFTs, S100, are last attempts for survival and this provides neuroprotection for certain time and ultimately may become pathological and speed up AD. This study may contribute in developing new potential diagnostic tests, interventions and treatments.",BMC Neurol,2016
26612516,G Protein-Gated K<sup>+</sup> Channel Ablation in Forebrain Pyramidal Neurons Selectively Impairs Fear Learning.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction occurs in many debilitating conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. The dorsal hippocampus is a critical locus of cognitive processes linked to spatial and contextual learning. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium ion (GIRK/Kir3) channels, which mediate the postsynaptic inhibitory effect of many neurotransmitters, have been implicated in hippocampal-dependent cognition. Available evidence, however, derives primarily from constitutive gain-of-function models that lack cellular specificity.
METHODS: We used constitutive and neuron-specific gene ablation models targeting an integral subunit of neuronal GIRK channels (GIRK2) to probe the impact of GIRK channels on associative learning and memory.
RESULTS: Constitutive Girk2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a striking deficit in hippocampal-dependent (contextual) and hippocampal-independent (cue) fear conditioning. Mice lacking GIRK2 in gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons (GAD-Cre:Girk2<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice) exhibited a clear deficit in GIRK-dependent signaling in dorsal hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons but no evident behavioral phenotype. Mice lacking GIRK2 in forebrain pyramidal neurons (CaMKII-Cre(+):Girk2<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice) exhibited diminished GIRK-dependent signaling in dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal pyramidal neurons. CaMKII-Cre(+):Girk2<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice also displayed a selective impairment in contextual fear conditioning, as both cue fear and spatial learning were intact in these mice. Finally, loss of GIRK2 in forebrain pyramidal neurons correlated with enhanced long-term depression and blunted depotentiation of long-term potentiation at the Schaffer collateral/cornu ammonis 1 synapse in the dorsal hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that GIRK channels in dorsal hippocampal pyramidal neurons are necessary for normal learning involving aversive stimuli and support the contention that dysregulation of GIRK-dependent signaling may underlie cognitive dysfunction in some disorders.",Biol Psychiatry,2016
27799057,Integrative network analysis of nineteen brain regions identifies molecular signatures and networks underlying selective regional vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. However, despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the molecular basis of AD development and progression remains elusive.
METHODS: To elucidate molecular systems associated with AD, we developed a large scale gene expression dataset from 1053 postmortem brain samples across 19 cortical regions of 125 individuals with a severity spectrum of dementia and neuropathology of AD. We excluded brain specimens that evidenced neuropathology other than that characteristic of AD. For the first time, we performed a pan-cortical brain region genomic analysis, characterizing the gene expression changes associated with a measure of dementia severity and multiple measures of the severity of neuropathological lesions associated with AD (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and constructing region-specific co-expression networks. We rank-ordered 44,692 gene probesets, 1558 co-expressed gene modules and 19 brain regions based upon their association with the disease traits.
RESULTS: The neurobiological pathways identified through these analyses included actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and nervous system development. Using public human brain single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we computed brain cell type-specific marker genes for human and determined that many of the abnormally expressed gene signatures and network modules were specific to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Analysis based on disease severity suggested that: many of the gene expression changes, including those of oligodendrocytes, occurred early in the progression of disease, making them potential translational/treatment development targets and unlikely to be mere bystander result of degeneration; several modules were closely linked to cognitive compromise with lesser association with traditional measures of neuropathology. The brain regional analyses identified temporal lobe gyri as sites associated with the greatest and earliest gene expression abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: This transcriptomic network analysis of 19 brain regions provides a comprehensive assessment of the critical molecular pathways associated with AD pathology and offers new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying selective regional vulnerability to AD at different stages of the progression of cognitive compromise and development of the canonical neuropathological lesions of AD.",Genome Med,2016
27636841,Perlecan Domain V Inhibits Amyloid-β Induced Activation of the α2β1 Integrin-Mediated Neurotoxic Signaling Cascade.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal death, neurofibrillary tangles, and senile plaques. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) is the major component of plaques and consists of two prominent isoforms, Aβ40 and Aβ42. As many risk factors for AD are vascular in origin and blood vessel defects in clearing Aβ from the brain are a potential key component of AD pathology, we have focused on the neuron-blood vessel interface, and in particular, the vascular basement membrane, which coats blood vessels and physically separates them from neurons. A prominent component of the vascular basement membrane is the extracellular matrix proteoglycan perlecan. Domain V (DV) is the C-terminal domain and is generated by perlecan proteolysis. DV interacts with the α2 integrin and Aβ is a ligand for both α2β1 and αvβ1. Due to the known interaction of DV with α2β1 and α2β1's requirement for Aβ deposition and neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that DV and/or its C-terminal domain, LG3, might alter neurotoxic signaling pathways by directly blocking or otherwise interfering with α2β1 binding by Aβ. Our study suggests that α2β1 mediates Aβ-induced activation of c-Jun and caspase-3, key components of the neurotoxic pathway, in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrate that DV and/or LG3 may therapeutically modulate these α2β1 mediated neurotoxic effects suggesting that they or other α2β1 integrin modulators could represent a novel approach to treat AD. Finally, our results suggest different neurotoxicity susceptibilities between cortical and hippocampal neurons to Aβ40 and Aβ42 as further underscored by differing neuroprotective potencies of LG3 in each cell type.",J Alzheimers Dis,2016
28103200,Depressive symptoms influence global cognitive impairment indirectly by reducing memory and executive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms negatively influence global cognition in the elderly; however, the mechanism of this effect remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether depressive symptoms influence global cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) by impeding specific neuropsychological abilities and under what conditions this effect might occur.
METHOD: A sample of 259 participants (104 cognitively normal elderly controls, 66 patients with MCI and 89 patients with mild AD) underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Global cognitive impairment was indexed by the composite of Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores and severity of depressive symptoms was measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
RESULTS: Among patients with MCI, greater severity of depressive symptoms was associated with greater global cognitive impairment, with a moderate effect size. A mediation analysis revealed that patients with MCI experiencing depressive symptoms may exhibit global cognitive impairment because their depressive symptoms were reducing their capacity for working memory, episodic memory and non-speed-based executive functions. A moderation analysis indicated that this effect was consistent across age, gender, years of education and APOE-e4 status for working memory and episodic memory, and was observed in patients with MCI older than 65 years for executive functions. In cognitively normal elderly adults and patients with AD, depressive symptoms were not associated with global cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms influence global cognitive function in patients with MCI indirectly by reducing mental space, mental flexibility and their capacity for consolidating and retrieving memories. These findings may guide clinicians to better diagnose and manage cognitive impairment in the context of concomitant depressive symptoms.",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,2016
27548756,Longitudinal β-Amyloid Deposition and Hippocampal Volume in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease and Suspected Non-Alzheimer Disease Pathophysiology.,"IMPORTANCE: Preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) can be staged using a 2-factor model denoting the presence or absence of β-amyloid (Aβ+/-) and neurodegeneration (ND+/-). The association of these stages with longitudinal biomarker outcomes is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether longitudinal Aβ accumulation and hippocampal atrophy differ based on initial preclinical staging.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal population-based cohort study used data collected at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, from December 1, 2006, to June 31, 2015. Cognitively normal older adults (n = 174) were recruited from the longitudinal Adult Children Study and Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia Study at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. At baseline, all participants had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), and cerebrospinal fluid assays of tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau) acquired within 12 months. Using the baseline biomarkers, individuals were classified into preclinical stage 0 (Aβ-/ND-), 1 (Aβ+/ND-), or 2+ (Aβ+/ND+) or suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP; Aβ-/ND+).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subsequent longitudinal accumulation of Aβ assessed with PiB PET and loss of hippocampal volume assessed with MRI in each group.
RESULTS: Among the 174 participants (81 men [46.6%]; 93 women [53.4%]; mean [SD] age, 65.7 [8.9] years), a proportion (14%-17%) of individuals with neurodegeneration alone (SNAP) later demonstrated Aβ+. The rates of Aβ accumulation and loss of hippocampal volume in individuals with SNAP were indistinguishable from those without any pathologic features at baseline (for Aβ accumulation: when hippocampal volume was used to define ND, t = 0.00 [P > .99]; when tau and ptau were used to define ND, t = -0.02 [P = .98]; for loss of hippocampal volume: when hippocampal volume was used to define ND, t = -1.34 [P = .18]; when tau and ptau were used to define ND, t = 0.84 [P = .40]). Later preclinical stages (stages 1 and 2+) had elevated Aβ accumulation. Using hippocampal volume to define ND, individuals with stage 1 had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 11.06; P < .001), stage 2+ (t = 2.10; P = .04), and SNAP (t = 9.32; P < .001), and those with stage 2+ had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 4.38; P < .001) and SNAP (t = 4.08; P < .001). When ND was defined using tau and ptau, individuals with stage 2+ had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 4.96) and SNAP (t = 4.06), and those with stage 1 had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 8.44) and SNAP (t = 6.61) (P < .001 for all comparisons). When ND was defined using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, individuals with stage 2+ had accelerated hippocampal atrophy relative to stage 0 (t = -3.41; P < .001), stage 1 (t = -2.48; P = .03), and SNAP (t = -2.26; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: More advanced preclinical stages of AD have greater longitudinal Aβ accumulation. SNAP appears most likely to capture inherent individual variability in brain structure or to represent comorbid pathologic features rather than early emerging AD. Low hippocampal volumes or elevated levels of tau or ptau in isolation may not accurately represent ongoing neurodegenerative processes.",JAMA Neurol,2016
27183206,Neuropathologic Associations of Learning and Memory in Primary Progressive Aphasia.,"IMPORTANCE: The dementia syndrome of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) can be caused by 1 of several neuropathologic entities, including forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer disease (AD). Although episodic memory is initially spared in this syndrome, the subtle learning and memory features of PPA and their neuropathologic associations have not been characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To detect subtle memory differences on the basis of autopsy-confirmed neuropathologic diagnoses in PPA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis was conducted at the Northwestern Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center in August 2015 using clinical and postmortem autopsy data that had been collected between August 1983 and June 2012. Thirteen patients who had the primary clinical diagnosis of PPA and an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of either AD (PPA-AD) or a tau variant of FTLD (PPA-FTLD) and 6 patients who had the clinical diagnosis of amnestic dementia and autopsy-confirmed AD (AMN-AD) were included.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Scores on the effortless learning, delayed retrieval, and retention conditions of the Three Words Three Shapes test, a specialized measure of verbal and nonverbal episodic memory.
RESULTS: The PPA-FTLD (n = 6), PPA-AD (n = 7), and AMN-AD (n = 6) groups did not differ by demographic composition (all P > .05). The sample mean (SD) age was 64.1 (10.3) years at symptom onset and 67.9 (9.9) years at Three Words Three Shapes test administration. The PPA-FTLD group had normal (ie, near-ceiling) scores on all verbal and nonverbal test conditions. Both the PPA-AD and AMN-AD groups had deficits in verbal effortless learning (mean [SD] number of errors, 9.9 [4.6] and 14.2 [2.0], respectively) and verbal delayed retrieval (mean [SD] number of errors, 6.1 [5.9] and 12.0 [4.4], respectively). The AMN-AD group had additional deficits in nonverbal effortless learning (mean [SD] number of errors, 10.3 [4.0]) and verbal retention (mean [SD] number of errors, 8.33 [5.2]), which were not observed in the PPA-FTLD or PPA-AD groups (all P < .005).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified neuropathologic associations of learning and memory in autopsy-confirmed cases of PPA. Among patients with clinical PPA syndrome, AD neuropathology appeared to interfere with effortless learning and delayed retrieval of verbal information, whereas FTLD-tau pathology did not. The results provide directions for future research on the interactions between limbic and language networks.",JAMA Neurol,2016
27533593,The Role of Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Stroke in Familial Alzheimer Disease.,"IMPORTANCE: The contribution of cardiovascular disease (CV) and cerebrovascular disease to the risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) has been long debated. Investigations have shown that antecedent CV risk factors increase the risk for LOAD, although other investigations have failed to validate this association.
OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of CV risk factors (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) and the history of stroke to LOAD in a data set of large families multiply affected by LOAD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease family study (hereinafter referred to as NIA-LOAD study) is a longitudinal study of families with multiple members affected with LOAD. A multiethnic community-based longitudinal study (Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project [WHICAP]) was used to replicate findings. The 6553 participants in the NIA-LOAD study were recruited from 23 US Alzheimer disease centers with ongoing data collection since 2003; the 5972 WHICAP participants were recruited at Columbia University with ongoing data collection since 1992. Data analysis was performed from 2003 to 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized mixed logistic regression models tested the association of CV risk factors (primary association) with LOAD. History of stroke was used for the secondary association. A secondary model adjusted for the presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A genetic risk score, based on common variants associated with LOAD, was used to account for LOAD genetic risk beyond the APOE ε4 effect. Mediation analyses evaluated stroke as a mediating factor between the primary association and LOAD.
RESULTS: A total of 6553 NIA-LOAD participants were included in the analyses (4044 women [61.7%]; 2509 men [38.3%]; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9] years), with 5972 individuals from the WHICAP study included in the replication sample (4072 women [68.2%]; 1900 men [31.8%]; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [7.0] years). Hypertension was associated with decreased LOAD risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72); type 2 diabetes and heart disease were not. History of stroke conferred greater than 2-fold increased risk for LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.75-2.83). Adjustment for APOE ε4 did not alter results. The genetic risk score was associated with LOAD (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05-3.97) but did not change the independent association of LOAD with hypertension or stroke. In the WHICAP sample, hypertension was not associated with LOAD (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11), whereas history of stroke increased the risk for LOAD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.56-2.46). The effect of hypertension on LOAD risk was also mediated by stroke in the NIA-LOAD and the WHICAP samples.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In familial and sporadic LOAD, a history of stroke was significantly associated with increased disease risk and mediated the association between selected CV risk factors and LOAD, which appears to be independent of the LOAD-related genetic background.",JAMA Neurol,2016
27878758,Gender-Specific Expression of Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 9 Modulates Tau Expression and Phosphorylation: Possible Implications for Tauopathies.,"Public transcriptomic studies have shown that several genes display pronounced gender differences in their expression in the human brain, which may influence the manifestations and risk for neuronal disorders. Here, we apply a transcriptome-wide analysis to discover genes with gender-specific expression and significant alterations in public postmortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared to controls. We identify the sex-linked ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 (USP9) as an outstanding candidate gene with highly significant expression differences between the genders and male-specific underexpression in AD. Since previous studies have shown that USP9 can modulate the phosphorylation of the AD-associated protein MAPT, we investigate functional associations between USP9 and MAPT in further detail. After observing a high positive correlation between the expression of USP9 and MAPT in the public transcriptomics data, we show that USP9 knockdown results in significantly decreased MAPT expression in a DU145 cell culture model and a concentration-dependent decrease for the MAPT orthologs mapta and maptb in a zebrafish model. From the analysis of microarray and qRT-PCR experiments for the knockdown in DU145 cells and prior knowledge from the literature, we derive a data-congruent model for a USP9-dependent regulatory mechanism modulating MAPT expression via BACH1 and SMAD4. Overall, the analyses suggest USP9 may contribute to molecular gender differences observed in tauopathies and provide a new target for intervention strategies to modulate MAPT expression.",Mol Neurobiol,2016
27956742,17q21.31 duplication causes prominent tau-related dementia with increased MAPT expression.,"To assess the role of rare copy number variations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted a case-control study using whole-exome sequencing data from 522 early-onset cases and 584 controls. The most recurrent rearrangement was a 17q21.31 microduplication, overlapping the CRHR1, MAPT, STH and KANSL1 genes that was found in four cases, including one de novo rearrangement, and was absent in controls. The increased MAPT gene dosage led to a 1.6-1.9-fold expression of the MAPT messenger RNA. Clinical signs, neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles were consistent with an AD diagnosis in MAPT duplication carriers. However, amyloid positon emission tomography (PET) imaging, performed in three patients, was negative. Analysis of an additional case with neuropathological examination confirmed that the MAPT duplication causes a complex tauopathy, including prominent neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the medial temporal lobe without amyloid-β deposits. 17q21.31 duplication is the genetic basis of a novel entity marked by prominent tauopathy, leading to early-onset dementia with an AD clinical phenotype. This entity could account for a proportion of probable AD cases with negative amyloid PET imaging recently identified in large clinical series.",Mol Psychiatry,2016
26642089,Visualizing APP and BACE-1 approximation in neurons yields insight into the amyloidogenic pathway.,"Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE-1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1) is the rate-limiting step in amyloid-β (Aβ) production and a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; thus, physical approximation of this substrate-enzyme pair is a crucial event with broad biological and therapeutic implications. Despite much research, neuronal locales of APP and BACE-1 convergence and APP cleavage remain unclear. Here we report an optical assay, based on fluorescence complementation, for visualizing in cellulo APP-BACE-1 interactions as a simple on/off signal. Combining this with other assays tracking the fate of internalized APP in hippocampal neurons, we found that APP and BACE-1 interacted in both biosynthetic and endocytic compartments, particularly along recycling microdomains such as dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons. In axons, APP and BACE-1 were cotransported, and they also interacted during transit. Finally, our assay revealed that the Alzheimer's disease-protective 'Icelandic' mutation greatly attenuates APP-BACE-1 interactions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for protection. Collectively, the data challenge canonical models and provide concrete insights into long-standing controversies in the field.",Nat Neurosci,2016
27836335,A novel presenilin 1 mutation (F388L) identified in a Chinese family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"A subset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurrence shows autosomal dominant, familial inheritance patterns. Such familial AD (FAD) are caused by mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, which encode amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2), respectively. Here, we report a novel PSEN1 mutation (c.1164C > G, p.F388L, mutation nomenclature according to National Center for Biotechnology Information Reference Sequence: NM_000021.3) occurring in a Chinese family with early-onset AD and cosegregating with affected family members. The average age at onset of this family was 43 years. The F388L mutation locates adjacent to the critical catalytic aspartate site (D385) of PS1. Overexpression of the F388L mutant significantly increased Aβ42 secretion and the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 when compared with wild type PS1, consisting with the notion that FAD-associated PS1 mutations induce disease pathogenesis by increasing Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Our results identify a novel pathogenic PS1 F388L mutation in a Chinese FAD family.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
27810638,Presenilin 1 mutations influence processing and trafficking of the ApoE receptor apoER2.,"Presenilin (PS)-1 is an intramembrane protease serving as the catalytic component of γ-secretase. Mutations in the PS1 gene are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). The low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor family member apoER2 is a γ-secretase substrate that has been associated with AD in several ways, including acting as a receptor for apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoER2 is processed by γ-secretase into a C-terminal fragment (γ-CTF) that appears to regulate gene expression. FAD PS1 mutations were tested for effects on apoER2. PS1 mutation R278I showed impaired γ-secretase activity for apoER2 in the basal state or after exposure to Reelin. PS1 M146V mutation permitted accumulation of apoER2 CTFs after Reelin treatment, whereas no difference was seen between wild-type (WT) and M146V in the basal state. PS1 L282V mutation, combined with the γ-secretase inhibitor N-(N-[3,5-Difluorophenacetyl]-L-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, greatly reduced the cell-surface levels of apoER2 without affecting total apoER2 levels, suggesting a defect in receptor trafficking. These findings indicate that impaired processing or localization of apoER2 may contribute to the pathogenic effects of FAD mutations in PS1.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
28027494,Ultrastructural evidence for impaired mitochondrial fission in the aged rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.,"Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mediates high-order cognitive functions that are impaired early in the aging process in monkeys and humans. Here, we report pronounced changes in mitochondrial morphology in dendrites of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurons from aged rhesus macaques. Electron microscopy paired with 3D reconstruction from serial sections revealed an age-related increase in mitochondria with thin segments that intermingled with enlarged ones, the 'mitochondria-on-a-string' phenotype, similar to those recently reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The thin mitochondrial segments were associated with endoplasmic reticulum cisterns, and the mitochondrial proteins Fis1 and Drp1, all of which initiate mitochondrial fission. These data suggest that the 'mitochondria-on-a-string' phenotype may reflect malfunction in mitochondrial dynamics, whereby fission is initiated, but the process is incomplete due to malfunction of subsequent step(s). Thus, aged rhesus monkeys may be particularly helpful in exploring the age-related changes that render higher cortical circuits so vulnerable to degeneration.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
28131015,Amyloid and intracellular accumulation of BRI<sub>2</sub>.,"Familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD) are caused by mutations in the BRI<sub>2</sub> gene. These diseases are characterized clinically by progressive dementia and ataxia and neuropathologically by amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Herein, we investigate BRI<sub>2</sub> protein accumulation in FBD, FDD, Alzheimer disease and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease. In FBD and FDD, we observed reduced processing of the mutant BRI<sub>2</sub> pro-protein, which was found accumulating intracellularly in the Golgi of neurons and glial cells. In addition, we observed an accumulation of a mature form of BRI<sub>2</sub> protein in dystrophic neurites, surrounding amyloid cores. Accumulation of BRI<sub>2</sub> was also observed in dystrophic neurites of Alzheimer disease and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease cases. Although it remains to be determined whether intracellular accumulation of BRI<sub>2</sub> may lead to cell damage in these degenerative diseases, our study provides new insights into the role of mutant BRI<sub>2</sub> in the pathogenesis of FBD and FDD and implicates BRI<sub>2</sub> as a potential indicator of neuritic damage in diseases characterized by cerebral amyloid deposition.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
28089352,Downregulation of miR-132/212 impairs S-nitrosylation balance and induces tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease.,"MicroRNA-132 is markedly downregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, and its levels are closely associated with tau pathology in AD. Whether and how miR-132 contributes to pathology in these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Here, we show that miR-132 and its paralogue miR-212 directly regulate the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) through the primate-specific binding site. Inhibition of miR-132 in primary human neurons and neural cells leads to increased NOS1 levels and triggers excessive production of nitric oxide, followed by aberrant S-nitrosylation (SNO) of specific proteins associated with neurodegeneration and tau pathology, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5, dynamin-related protein 1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This, in turn, increases tau phosphorylation at disease associated Ser396, Ser404, and Ser202 sites, and impairs neural viability. Our findings indicate that downregulation of miR-132/212 disturbs the balance of S-nitrosylation and induces tau phosphorylation in a NOS1-dependent way, and thereby may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
27837675,PGE<sub>2</sub>-EP3 signaling pathway impairs hippocampal presynaptic long-term plasticity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by early cognitive deficits linked to synaptic dysfunction and loss. Considerable evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to AD. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), a key neuroinflammatory molecule, modulates hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity. We investigated the effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> on synaptic transmission and presynaptic plasticity at synapses between mossy fibers from the dentate gyrus and CA3 pyramidal cells (Mf-CA3 synapse). These synapses are involved in mnemonic processes and consequently may be of relevance for AD. We provide evidence that although PGE<sub>2</sub> had no effect both on either basal transmission or short-term plasticity, it strongly impaired presynaptic Mf-CA3 long-term potentiation (LTP) by acting on PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor 3 (EP3) receptors. During aging, hippocampal levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> markedly increased in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and impaired specifically presynaptic LTP via a PGE<sub>2</sub>-EP3 signaling pathway. In summary, the building up of PGE<sub>2</sub> during the progression of AD leads to specific impairment of hippocampal presynaptic plasticity and highlights EP3 receptors as a potential target to alleviate cognitive deficits in AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
27940352,Gray matter network differences between behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.,"We set out to study whether single-subject gray matter (GM) networks show disturbances that are specific for Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 90) or behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD; n = 59), and whether such disturbances would be related to cognitive deficits measured with mini-mental state examination and a neuropsychological battery, using subjective cognitive decline subjects as reference. AD and bvFTD patients had a lower degree, connectivity density, clustering, path length, betweenness centrality, and small world values compared with subjective cognitive decline. AD patients had a lower connectivity density than bvFTD patients (F = 5.79, p = 0.02; mean ± standard deviation bvFTD 16.10 ± 1.19%; mean ± standard deviation AD 15.64 ± 1.02%). Lasso logistic regression showed that connectivity differences between bvFTD and AD were specific to 23 anatomical areas, in terms of local GM volume, degree, and clustering. Lower clustering values and lower degree values were specifically associated with worse mini-mental state examination scores and lower performance on the neuropsychological tests. GM showed disease-specific alterations, when comparing bvFTD with AD patients, and these alterations were associated with cognitive deficits.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
28068565,Retinal thinning is uniquely associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in neurologically normal older adults.,"Given the converging pathologic and epidemiologic data indicating a relationship between retinal integrity and neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), we aimed to determine if retinal structure correlates with medial temporal lobe (MTL) structure and function in neurologically normal older adults. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, verbal and visual memory testing, and 3T-magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were performed in 79 neurologically normal adults enrolled in a healthy aging cohort study. Retinal nerve fiber thinning and reduced total macular and macular ganglion cell volumes were each associated with smaller MTL volumes (ps < 0.04). Notably, these markers of retinal structure were not associated with primary motor cortex or basal ganglia volumes (regions relatively unaffected in AD) (ps > 0.70), or frontal, precuneus, or temporoparietal volumes (regions affected in later AD Braak staging ps > 0.20). Retinal structure was not significantly associated with verbal or visual memory consolidation performances (ps > 0.14). Retinal structure was associated with MTL volumes, but not memory performances, in otherwise neurologically normal older adults. Given that MTL atrophy is a neuropathological hallmark of AD, retinal integrity may be an early marker of ongoing AD-related brain health.",Neurobiol Aging,2016
27986873,Long-term cortisol measures predict Alzheimer disease risk.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether long-term measures of cortisol predict Alzheimer disease (AD) risk.
METHOD: We used a prospective longitudinal design to examine whether cortisol dysregulation was related to AD risk. Participants were from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and submitted multiple 24-hour urine samples over an average interval of 10.56 years. Urinary free cortisol (UFC) and creatinine (Cr) were measured, and a UFC/Cr ratio was calculated to standardize UFC. To measure cortisol regulation, we used within-person UFC/Cr level (i.e., within-person mean), change in UFC/Cr over time (i.e., within-person slope), and UFC/Cr variability (i.e., within-person coefficient of variation). Cox regression was used to assess whether UFC/Cr measures predicted AD risk.
RESULTS: UFC/Cr level and UFC/Cr variability, but not UFC/Cr slope, were significant predictors of AD risk an average of 2.9 years before AD onset. Elevated UFC/Cr level and elevated UFC/Cr variability were related to a 1.31- and 1.38-times increase in AD risk, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis, increased UFC/Cr level and increased UFC/Cr variability predicted increased AD risk an average of 6 years before AD onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Cortisol dysregulation as manifested by high UFC/Cr level and high UFC/Cr variability may modulate the downstream clinical expression of AD pathology or be a preclinical marker of AD.",Neurology,2016
27708128,Female advantage in verbal memory: Evidence of sex-specific cognitive reserve.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated sex differences in verbal memory across different levels of neural dysfunction, measured by temporal lobe glucose metabolic rates (TLGluMR).
METHODS: Three hundred ninety controls and 672 participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 254 with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using linear regression to examine the sex by TLGluMR interaction on RAVLT performance in the overall sample and within diagnostic groups adjusting for age, education, and APOE ε4 genotype.
RESULTS: Across groups, female sex and higher TLGluMR and their interaction were associated with better verbal memory (p values ≤ 0.005). The female advantage in verbal memory varied by TLGluMR such that the advantage was greatest among individuals with moderate to high TLGluMR and minimal or absent among individuals with lower TLGluMR. Diagnosis-stratified analyses revealed that this interaction was driven by the aMCI group (p values = 0.009). The interaction was not significant in control and AD dementia groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Women show better verbal memory than men in aMCI despite similar levels of brain hypometabolism. The lifelong advantage that females show over males in verbal memory might represent a form of cognitive reserve that delays verbal memory decline until more advanced pathology, as indexed by TLGluMR. This issue is clinically important because verbal memory scores are used in diagnosing aMCI and AD dementia.",Neurology,2016
27733562,Presymptomatic cortical thinning in familial Alzheimer disease: A longitudinal MRI study.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify a cortical signature pattern of cortical thinning in familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) and assess its utility in detecting and tracking presymptomatic neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We recruited 43 FAD mutation carriers-36 PSEN1, 7 APP (20 symptomatic, 23 presymptomatic)-and 42 healthy controls to a longitudinal clinical and MRI study. T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired at baseline in all participants; 55 individuals (33 mutation carriers; 22 controls) had multiple (mean 2.9) follow-up scans approximately annually. Cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer. A cortical thinning signature was identified from symptomatic FAD participants. We then examined cortical thickness changes in this signature region in presymptomatic carriers and assessed associations with cognitive performance.
RESULTS: The cortical signature included 6 regions: entorhinal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, precuneus, superior parietal cortex, superior frontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. There were significant differences in mean cortical signature thickness between mutation carriers and controls 3 years before predicted symptom onset. The earliest significant difference in a single region, detectable 4 years preonset, was in the precuneus. Rate of change in cortical thickness became significantly different in the cortical signature at 5 years before predicted onset, and in the precuneus at 8 years preonset. Baseline mean signature thickness predicted rate of subsequent thinning and correlated with presymptomatic cognitive change.
CONCLUSIONS: The FAD cortical signature appears to be similar to that described for sporadic AD. All component regions showed significant presymptomatic thinning. A composite signature may provide more robust results than a single region and have utility as an outcome measure in presymptomatic trials.",Neurology,2016
27940650,Autopsy validation of 123I-FP-CIT dopaminergic neuroimaging for the diagnosis of DLB.,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a validation study of <sup>123</sup>I-N-fluoropropyl-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (<sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT) SPECT dopaminergic imaging in the clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with autopsy as the gold standard.
METHODS: Patients &gt;60 years of age with dementia who had undergone <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT imaging in research studies and who had donated their brain tissue to the Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource were included. All had structured clinical research assessments, and clinical diagnoses were applied by consensus panels using international diagnostic criteria. All underwent <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT imaging at baseline, and scans were rated as normal or abnormal by blinded raters. Patients were reviewed in prospective studies and after death underwent detailed autopsy assessment, and neuropathologic diagnoses were applied with the use of standard international criteria.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (33 with DLB and 22 with Alzheimer disease) were included. Against autopsy diagnosis, <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT had a balanced diagnostic accuracy of 86% (sensitivity 80%, specificity 92%) compared with clinical diagnosis, which had an accuracy of 79% (sensitivity 87%, specificity 72%). Among patients with DLB, 10% (3 patients) met pathologic criteria for Lewy body disease but had normal <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: This large autopsy analysis of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT imaging in dementia demonstrates that it is a valid and accurate biomarker for DLB, and the high specificity compared with clinical diagnosis (20% higher) is clinically important. The results need to be replicated with patients recruited from a wider range of settings, including movement disorder clinics and general practice. While an abnormal <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT scan strongly supports Lewy body disease, a normal scan does not exclude DLB with minimal brainstem involvement.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT dopaminergic neuroimaging accurately identifies patients with DLB.",Neurology,2016
26975659,NetDecoder: a network biology platform that decodes context-specific biological networks and gene activities.,"The sequential chain of interactions altering the binary state of a biomolecule represents the 'information flow' within a cellular network that determines phenotypic properties. Given the lack of computational tools to dissect context-dependent networks and gene activities, we developed NetDecoder, a network biology platform that models context-dependent information flows using pairwise phenotypic comparative analyses of protein-protein interactions. Using breast cancer, dyslipidemia and Alzheimer's disease as case studies, we demonstrate NetDecoder dissects subnetworks to identify key players significantly impacting cell behaviour specific to a given disease context. We further show genes residing in disease-specific subnetworks are enriched in disease-related signalling pathways and information flow profiles, which drive the resulting disease phenotypes. We also devise a novel scoring scheme to quantify key genes-network routers, which influence many genes, key targets, which are influenced by many genes, and high impact genes, which experience a significant change in regulation. We show the robustness of our results against parameter changes. Our network biology platform includes freely available source code (http://www.NetDecoder.org) for researchers to explore genome-wide context-dependent information flow profiles and key genes, given a set of genes of particular interest and transcriptome data. More importantly, NetDecoder will enable researchers to uncover context-dependent drug targets.",Nucleic Acids Res,2016

28005987,Metabolic Characterization of Intact Cells Reveals Intracellular Amyloid Beta but Not Its Precursor Protein to Reduce Mitochondrial Respiration.,"One hallmark of Alzheimer´s disease are senile plaques consisting of amyloid beta (Aβ), which derives from the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer´s disease and both Aβ and APP have been reported to affect mitochondrial function in isolated systems. However, in intact cells, considering a physiological localization of APP and Aβ, it is pending what triggers the mitochondrial defect. Thus, the aim of this study was to dissect the impact of APP versus Aβ in inducing mitochondrial alterations with respect to their subcellular localization. We performed an overexpression of APP or beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), increasing APP and Aβ levels or Aβ alone, respectively. Conducting a comprehensive metabolic characterization we demonstrate that only APP overexpression reduced mitochondrial respiration, despite lower extracellular Aβ levels compared to BACE overexpression. Surprisingly, this could be rescued by a gamma secretase inhibitor, oppositionally indicating an Aβ-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. Analyzing Aβ localization revealed that intracellular levels of Aβ and an increased spatial association of APP/Aβ with mitochondria are associated with reduced mitochondrial respiration. Thus, our data provide marked evidence for a prominent role of intracellular Aβ accumulation in Alzheimer´s disease associated mitochondrial dysfunction. Thereby it highlights the importance of the localization of APP processing and intracellular transport as a decisive factor for mitochondrial function, linking two prominent hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases.",PLoS One,2016
28004737,Investigating the Neuroprotective Effects of Turmeric Extract: Structural Interactions of β-Amyloid Peptide with Single Curcuminoids.,"A broad biophysical analysis was performed to investigate the molecular basis of the neuroprotective action of Curcuma longa extracts in Alzheimer's disease. By combining circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments with molecular modeling calculations, the minor components of Curcuma longa extracts, such as demethoxycurcumin (2, DMC), bisdemethoxycurcumin (3, BDMC) and cyclocurcumin (4, CYC), were analyzed in a membrane environment mimicking the phospholipid bilayer. Our study provides the first evidence on the relative role of single curcuminoids interacting with Aβ-peptide. When the CYC and curcumin metabolite tetrahydrocurcumin (5, THC) were inserted into an anionic lipid solution, a significant modification of the Aβ CD curves was detected. These data were implemented by EPR experiments, demonstrating that CYC reaches the inner part of the bilayer, while the other curcuminoids are localized close to the membrane interface. Computational studies provided a model for the curcuminoid-Aβ interaction, highlighting the importance of a constrained ""semi-folded"" conformation to interact with Aβ analogously to the pattern observed in α-helical coiled-coil peptide structures. This combined approach led to a better understanding of the intriguing in vitro and in vivo activity of curcuminoids as anti-Alzheimer agents, paving a new path for the rational design of optimized druggable analogues.",Sci Rep,2016
27440727,Imaging synaptic density in the living human brain.,"Chemical synapses are the predominant neuron-to-neuron contact in the central nervous system. Presynaptic boutons of neurons contain hundreds of vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, the diffusible signaling chemicals. Changes in the number of synapses are associated with numerous brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. However, all current approaches for measuring synaptic density in humans require brain tissue from autopsy or surgical resection. We report the use of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [(11)C]UCB-J combined with positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify synaptic density in the living human brain. Validation studies in a baboon confirmed that SV2A is an alternative synaptic density marker to synaptophysin. First-in-human PET studies demonstrated that [(11)C]UCB-J had excellent imaging properties. Finally, we confirmed that PET imaging of SV2A was sensitive to synaptic loss in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, [(11)C]UCB-J PET imaging is a promising approach for in vivo quantification of synaptic density with several potential applications in diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Sci Transl Med,2016

Mutations and/or differential expression of microglial specific receptors such as TREM2, CD33, and CR3 have been associated with strong increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). DAP12 (DNAX-activating protein 12)/TYROBP, a molecule localized to microglia, is a direct partner/adapter for TREM2, CD33, and CR3. We and others have previously shown that TYROBP expression is increased in AD patients and in mouse models. Moreover, missense mutations in the coding region of TYROBP have recently been identified in some AD patients. These lines of evidence, along with computational analysis of LOAD brain gene expression, point to DAP12/TYROBP as a potential hub or driver protein in the pathogenesis of AD. Using a comprehensive panel of biochemical, physiological, behavioral, and transcriptomic assays, we evaluated in a mouse model the role of TYROBP in early stage AD. We crossed an Alzheimer's model mutant APP <sup>KM670/671NL</sup> /PSEN1 <sup>Δexon9</sup> (APP/PSEN1) mouse model with Tyrobp <sup>-/-</sup> mice to generate AD model mice deficient or null for TYROBP (APP/PSEN1; Tyrobp <sup>+/-</sup> or APP/PSEN1; Tyrobp <sup>-/-</sup>). While we observed relatively minor effects of TYROBP deficiency on steady-state levels of amyloid-β peptides, there was an effect of Tyrobp deficiency on the morphology of amyloid deposits resembling that reported by others for Trem2 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. We identified modulatory effects of TYROBP deficiency on the level of phosphorylation of TAU that was accompanied by a reduction in the severity of neuritic dystrophy. TYROBP deficiency also altered the expression of several AD related genes, including Cd33. Electrophysiological abnormalities and learning behavior deficits associated with APP/PSEN1 transgenes were greatly attenuated on a Tyrobp-null background. Some modulatory effects of TYROBP on Alzheimer's-related genes were only apparent on a background of mice with cerebral amyloidosis due to overexpression of mutant APP/PSEN1. These results suggest that reduction of TYROBP gene expression and/or protein levels could represent an immune-inflammatory therapeutic opportunity for modulating early stage LOAD, potentially leading to slowing or arresting the progression to full-blown clinical and pathological LOAD.",Acta Neuropathol,2017
28477083,Peritoneal dialysis reduces amyloid-beta plasma levels in humans and attenuates Alzheimer-associated phenotypes in an APP/PS1 mouse model.,"Clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) from the brain is an important therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current studies mainly focus on the central approach of Aβ clearance by introducing therapeutic agents into the brain. In a previous study, we found that peripheral tissues and organs play important roles in clearing brain-derived Aβ, suggesting that the peripheral approach of removing Aβ from the blood may also be effective for AD therapy. Here, we investigated whether peritoneal dialysis, a clinically available therapeutic method for chronic kidney disease (CKD), reduces brain Aβ burden and attenuates AD-type pathologies and cognitive impairments. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed CKD were enrolled. The plasma Aβ concentrations of the patients were measured before and after peritoneal dialysis. APP/PS1 mice were subjected to peritoneal dialysis once a day for 1 month from 6 months of age (prevention study) or 9 months of age (treatment study). The Aβ in the interstitial fluid (ISF) was collected using microdialysis. Behavioural performance, long-term potentiation (LTP), Aβ burden and other AD-type pathologies were measured after 1 month of peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis significantly reduced plasma Aβ levels in both CKD patients and APP/PS1 mice. Aβ levels in the brain ISF of APP/PS1 mice immediately decreased after reduction of Aβ in the blood during peritoneal dialysis. In both prevention and treatment studies, peritoneal dialysis substantially reduced Aβ deposition, attenuated other AD-type pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, glial activation, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunction, and rescued the behavioural deficits of APPswe/PS1 mice. Importantly, the Aβ phagocytosis function of microglia was enhanced in APP/PS1 mice after peritoneal dialysis. Our study suggests that peritoneal dialysis is a promising therapeutic method for AD, and Aβ clearance using a peripheral approach could be a desirable therapeutic strategy for AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2017
28488154,Impact of multiple pathologies on the threshold for clinically overt dementia.,"Longitudinal clinical-pathological studies have increasingly recognized the importance of mixed pathologies (the coexistence of one or more neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease pathologies) as important factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia. Older persons with AD pathology, often have concomitant cerebrovascular disease pathologies (macroinfarcts, microinfarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy) as well as other concomitant neurodegenerative disease pathologies (Lewy bodies, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis). These additional pathologies lower the threshold for clinical diagnosis of AD. Many of these findings from pathologic studies, especially for CVD, have been confirmed using sophisticated neuroimaging technologies. In vivo biomarker studies are necessary to provide an understanding of specific pathologic contributions and time course relationships along the spectrum of accumulating pathologies. In this review, we provide a clinical-pathological perspective on the role of multiple brain pathologies in dementia followed by a review of the available clinical and biomarker data on some of the mixed pathologies.",Acta Neuropathol,2017
28582280,Lorazepam Challenge for Individuals at Varying Genetic Risk for Alzheimer Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: This study set out to clarify the differential acute cognitive impact of lorazepam based on varying genetic risk for Alzheimer disease.
METHODS: Fifty-seven cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 51 to 88, genotyped according to apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane (40 homolog) poly-T lengths, completed cognitive testing before, 2.5 and 5 hours after receiving a 1 mg dose of lorazepam.
RESULTS: Post-lorazepam, there were significant (P<0.05) declines from baseline in memory, psychomotor processing speed, and executive function. At 2.5 hours, the magnitude of this lorazepam-induced cognitive change was significantly greater in the APOE3/4 group than in the APOE3/3 group for tests of working memory and visuospatial memory/executive function. At 5 hours postchallenge, verbal memory and working memory deficits persisted in the APOE3/4 group compared with the APOE3/3 group. At 5 hours after lorazepam challenge, as compared with the very long/very long group, the short/short group performed slightly worse on a test of working memory (P<0.05), but no other differences were observed among translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog poly-T variant groups.
DISCUSSION: The lorazepam challenge may be unmasking presymptomatic cognitive dysfunction associated with APOE4 carriage.",Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,2017
28974416,Concomitant vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies double the risk of dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: The relative contributions of vascular and degenerative pathology to dementia are unknown. We aim to quantify the proportion of dementia explained by potentially preventable vascular lesions.
METHODS: We systematically searched for population-based cohorts before February 2017 reporting clinicopathological data for individuals with and without dementia. We calculated the summary proportion and absolute risk of dementia comparing subjects with and without the pathology.
RESULTS: We identified 10 studies comprising 2856 subjects. Vascular-type pathology and mixed pathology are respectively two and three times more likely in demented patients. The summary proportion of dementia is 77%-86% in subjects with mixed degenerative and vascular pathology and 45% in subjects with pure Alzheimer-type pathology.
DISCUSSION: Patients with mixed pathologies have nearly twice the incremental risk of dementia compared with patients with only Alzheimer-type lesions. Consequently, many cases of dementia could be prevented or delayed by targeting the vascular component.",Alzheimers Dement,2017

29268078,"Longitudinal uncoupling of cerebral perfusion, glucose metabolism, and tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Cross-sectional findings using the tau tracer [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5317 (THK5317) have shown that [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data can be approximated using perfusion measures (early-frame standardized uptake value ratio; ratio of tracer delivery in target to reference regions). In this way, a single PET study can provide both functional and molecular information.
METHODS: We included 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease who completed follow-up THK5317 and FDG studies 17 months after baseline investigations. Linear mixed-effects models and annual percentage change maps were used to examine longitudinal change.
RESULTS: Limited spatial overlap was observed between areas showing declines in THK5317 perfusion measures and FDG. Minimal overlap was seen between areas showing functional change and those showing increased retention of THK5317.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest a spatiotemporal offset between functional changes and tau pathology and a partial uncoupling between perfusion and metabolism, possibly as a function of Alzheimer's disease severity.",Alzheimers Dement,2017
29245000,Does traumatic brain injury hold the key to the Alzheimer's disease puzzle?,"INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative disorders have been a graveyard for hundreds of well-intentioned efforts at drug discovery and development. Concussion and other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share many overlapping pathologies and possible clinical links.
METHODS: We searched the literature since 1995 using MEDLINE and Google Scholar for the terms concussion, AD, and shared neuropathologies. We also studied a TBI animal model as a supplement to transgenic (Tg) mouse AD models for evaluating AD drug efficacy by preventing neuronal losses. To evaluate TBI/AD pathologies and neuronal self-induced cell death (apoptosis), we are studying brain extracellular vesicles in plasma and (-)-phenserine pharmacology to probe, in animal models of AD and humans, apoptosis and pathways common to concussion and AD.
RESULTS: Neuronal cell death and a diverse and significant pathological cascade follow TBIs. Many of the developing pathologies are present in early AD. The use of an animal model of concussion as a supplement to Tg mice provides an indication of an AD drug candidate's potential for preventing apoptosis and resulting progression toward dementia in AD. This weight drop supplementation to Tg mouse models, the experimental drug (-)-phenserine, and plasma-derived extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal origin to follow biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes, each and in combination, show promise as tools useful for probing the progression of disease in AD, TBI/AD pathologies, apoptosis, and drug effects on rates of apoptosis both preclinically and in humans. (-)-Phenserine both countered many subacute post-TBI pathologies that could initiate clinical AD and, in the concussion and other animal models, showed evidence consistent with direct inhibition of neuronal preprogrammed cell death in the presence of TBI/AD pathologies.
DISCUSSION: These findings may provide support for expanding preclinical Tg mouse studies in AD with a TBI weight drop model, insights into the progression of pathological targets, their relations to apoptosis, and timing of interventions against these targets and apoptosis. Such studies may demonstrate the potential for drugs to effectively and safely inhibit preprogrammed cell death as a new drug development strategy for use in the fight to defeat AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2017
28856789,Longitudinal telomere shortening and early Alzheimer's disease progression in adults with down syndrome.,"Telomere shortening was shown to parallel Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated dementia. By using a dual PNA Probe system we have developed a practical method for comparing telomere length in T-lymphocyte interphases from individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with and without ""mild cognitive impairment"" (MCI-DS) and demonstrated that telomere length can serve as a valid biomarker for the onset of MCI-DS in this high-risk population. To verify progressive cognitive decline we have now examined sequential changes in telomere length in 10 adults with DS (N = 4 Female, N = 6 Male) developing MCI-DS. Cases were selected blind to telomere length from a sample of adults with DS previously enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study at 18-month intervals with clinical and telomere assessments: (1) MCI-DS group data were collected approximately three years prior to development of MCI-DS; (2) 18 months later; (3) when MCI-DS was first observed. These telomere measures were compared to those from another 10 adults with DS matched by sex and approximate age but without indications of MCI-DS (Controls). PNA (peptide nucleic acid) probes for telomeres together with a chromosome two centromere probe were used. Findings indicated telomere shortening over time for both Cases and Controls. Group differences emerged by 18-months prior to recognition of MCI-DS onset and completely non-overlapping distributions of telomere measures were observed by the time of MCI-DS onset. This study adds to accumulating evidence of the value of telomere length, as an early biomarker of AD progression in adults with Down syndrome.",Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,2017
29130521,A variant in PPP4R3A protects against alzheimer-related metabolic decline.,"OBJECTIVES: A reduction in glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) predicts conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tracks disease progression, signifying its importance in AD. We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([<sup>18</sup> F] FDG) positron emission tomography measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (n = 606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent data set (n = 870). Last, we assessed whether significant SNP influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing data sets (n = 210 and n = 159).
RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene, PPP4R3A, and reduced [<sup>18</sup> F] FDG decline (p = 4.44 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ). In a follow-up analysis using an independent data set, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (p = 0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (p = 3.41 × 10<sup>-15</sup> ). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered PPPP4R3A transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level.
INTERPRETATIONS: PPP4R3A is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant, PPP4R3A should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies. Ann Neurol 2017;82:900-911.",Ann Neurol,2017
28881979,Identification of associations between genotypes and longitudinal phenotypes via temporally-constrained group sparse canonical correlation analysis.,"MOTIVATION: Neuroimaging genetics identifies the relationships between genetic variants (i.e., the single nucleotide polymorphisms) and brain imaging data to reveal the associations from genotypes to phenotypes. So far, most existing machine-learning approaches are widely used to detect the effective associations between genetic variants and brain imaging data at one time-point. However, those associations are based on static phenotypes and ignore the temporal dynamics of the phenotypical changes. The phenotypes across multiple time-points may exhibit temporal patterns that can be used to facilitate the understanding of the degenerative process. In this article, we propose a novel temporally constrained group sparse canonical correlation analysis (TGSCCA) framework to identify genetic associations with longitudinal phenotypic markers.
RESULTS: The proposed TGSCCA method is able to capture the temporal changes in brain from longitudinal phenotypes by incorporating the fused penalty, which requires that the differences between two consecutive canonical weight vectors from adjacent time-points should be small. A new efficient optimization algorithm is designed to solve the objective function. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on both synthetic and real data (i.e., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, including progressive mild cognitive impairment, stable MCI and Normal Control participants). In comparison with conventional SCCA, our proposed method can achieve strong associations and discover phenotypic biomarkers across multiple time-points to guide disease-progressive interpretation.

29301614,Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors 2 and 3 as Targets for Treating Nicotine Addiction.,"Tobacco smoking, driven by the addictive properties of nicotine, continues to be a worldwide health problem. Based on the well-established role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in drug addiction, novel medication development strategies seek to halt nicotine consumption and prevent relapse to tobacco smoking by modulating glutamate transmission. The presynaptic inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) are key autoreceptors on glutamatergic terminals that maintain glutamate homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests the critical role of mGluR2/3 in different aspects of nicotine addiction, including acquisition and maintenance of nicotine taking, nicotine withdrawal, and persistent nicotine seeking even after prolonged abstinence. The involvement of mGluR2/3 in other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and pain, provides convincing evidence suggesting that mGluR2/3 may provide an effective therapeutic approach for comorbidity of smoking and these conditions. This focused review article highlights that mGluR2/3 provide a promising target in the search for smoking cessation medication with novel mechanisms of actions that differ from those of currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies.",Biol Psychiatry,2017
28349725,[Formula: see text]The effect of stereotype threat on older people's clinical cognitive outcomes: investigating the moderating role of dementia worry.,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown that stereotype threat (ST) reduces older people's cognitive performance, but few have studied its impact on clinical cognitive outcomes. Our study was designed to further examine the impact of ST on the clinical assessment of older subjects' cognitive functioning, as well as the moderating role of fear of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (or 'dementia worry').
METHOD: Seventy-two neurologically normal (MMSE > 26) participants aged between 59 and 70 completed a set of neuropsychological tasks in either an ST or a positive condition (condition in which negative stereotypes were invalidated).
RESULTS: Regression-based path analyses showed that only participants who expressed moderate or high fear of AD underperformed on executive tasks in the ST condition compared to their counterparts in the positive condition. Moreover, in the ST condition, participants' performance on executive tasks was more impaired (relative to normative data) than in the positive condition. However, ST had no effect on memory and attention performance.
DISCUSSION: Our results showed that ST can cause older people to perform at pathological levels on executive tasks. Results highlight the need for clinicians to be cautious when conducting neuropsychological assessments of older people who express high levels of dementia worry.",Clin Neuropsychol,2017
28994390,Clearance of beta-amyloid is facilitated by apolipoprotein E and circulating high-density lipoproteins in bioengineered human vessels.,"Amyloid plaques, consisting of deposited beta-amyloid (Aβ), are a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cerebral vessels play a major role in AD, as Aβ is cleared from the brain by pathways involving the cerebrovasculature, most AD patients have cerebrovascular amyloid (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cardiovascular risk factors increase dementia risk. Here we present a notable advance in vascular tissue engineering by generating the first functional 3-dimensioinal model of CAA in bioengineered human vessels. We show that lipoproteins including brain (apoE) and circulating (high-density lipoprotein, HDL) synergize to facilitate Aβ transport across bioengineered human cerebral vessels. These lipoproteins facilitate Aβ42 transport more efficiently than Aβ40, consistent with Aβ40 being the primary species that accumulates in CAA. Moreover, apoE4 is less effective than apoE2 in promoting Aβ transport, also consistent with the well-established role of apoE4 in Aβ deposition in AD.",Elife,2017
28424864,Loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells is associated with increased risk for disease and mortality in aging men.,"Recent discoveries have shown that harboring cells without the Y chromosome in the peripheral blood is associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality and disease such as different forms of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, as well as other conditions in aging men. In the entire world, the life expectancy of men is shorter compared to women, a sex difference that has been known for centuries, but the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood. As a male-specific genetic risk factor, an increased risk for pathology and mortality associated with mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells could help to explain that men on average live shorter lives compared to women. This review primarily focuses on observed associations between LOY in blood and various diseases in aging men. Other topics covered are known risk factors for LOY, methods to detect LOY, and a discussion regarding mechanisms such as immunosurveillance, that could possibly explain how an acquired mutation in blood cells can be associated with disease processes in other organs.",Hum Genet,2017
28984592,TOMM40 and APOE Gene Expression and Cognitive Decline in Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Subjects.,"BACKGROUND: TOMM40 is located on chromosome 19, is in linkage disequilibrium with apolipoprotein E (APOE), andis reported in several genome-wide association studies to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: Assess APOE and TOM40 and mitochondrial genes as blood biomarkers for AD.
METHODS: We examined TOMM40, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), and APOE mRNA expression in relation to the methylation rates of CpG sites in the upstream region of TOMM40exon 1 in peripheral leukocytes and TOMM40523 polyT genotypes in 60 AD and age- and sex-matched control subjects.
RESULTS: TOMM40 mRNA expression was significantly lower in AD subjects (0.87±0.18 versus 1.0±0.23, p = 0.005), and PINK1 mRNA expression was higher in AD subjects (1.5±0.61 versus 1.0±0.52, p < 0.001). TOMM40 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination total score (r = 0.290, p = 0.027). There was no expressional change in peripheral APOE mRNA in either AD or control subjects (p = 0.32). Methylation rates in the upstream region of TOMM40exon 1 were not different between AD and control subjects (average rate: 1.37±0.99 versus 1.39±1.20, p = 0.885), and TOMM40523 polyT genotypes were also not different between AD and control subjects (p = 0.67).
CONCLUSION: TOMM40 mRNA expression was lower in AD subjects and was correlated with cognitive decline. Significant changes in both TOMM40 and PINK1 mRNA may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
29036823,Prevalence and Correlates of Behavioral Disorders in Old Age Subjects with Cognitive Impairment: Results from the ReGAl Project.,"BACKGROUND: Presence of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is very common in subjects with cognitive impairment, representing an important determinant of disease progression, institutionalization, and worse prognosis. Knowledge of the prevalence and correlates of BPSD in community-living old subjects with cognitive impairment is limited so far, but it is essential for establishing specifically tailored care and cure in such a vulnerable population.
OBJECTIVE: With this study, we aimed at investigating, in a large sample of old age subjects with cognitive impairment, BPSD prevalence and correlates including the main demographic, clinical, and socio-environmental characteristics.
METHODS: Data were gathered from the ReGAl project (Rete Geriatrica Alzheimer; Geriatric Network on Alzheimer's disease), a large longitudinal Italian multicentric clinical-based study, promoted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics (SIGG).
RESULTS: We evaluated data from 4,157 old-age subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (541; 13%) or dementia (3616; 87%). 85.2% of all the population presented with at least one BPSD. Using a factor analysis, we identified four factors of BPSD: psychotic, affective, maniac, and impulse control behaviors. Logistic regression analyses revealed that among the main demographic, clinical, and socio-environmental aspects considered, only comorbidity was associated with all factors, independently of multiple covariates.
CONCLUSION: Identification of BPSD is crucial in everyday clinical practice and necessary to develop specific interventions and to define appropriate outcomes in their management. BPSD occur in a complex psychopathological context, influenced by several demographic and environmental factors that must be taken into account for a correct diagnosis and treatment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
28984604,Alzheimer's Disease-Related Polymorphisms in Shunt-Responsive Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a late onset, surgically treated progressive brain disease caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and subsequent ventriculomegaly. Comorbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) seems to be frequent in iNPH.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the role of AD-related polymorphisms in iNPH.
METHODS: Overall 188 shunt-operated iNPH patients and 688 controls without diagnosed neurodegenerative disease were included into analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs FRMD4A [rs7081208_A, rs2446581_A, rs17314229_T], CR1, BIN, CD2AP, CLU, MS4A6A, MS4A4E, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, INPP5D, HLA_DRB5, EPHA1, PTK2B, CELF1, SORL1, FERMT2, SLC24A, DSG2, CASS4, and NME8) adjusted to APOE were analyzed between groups by using binary logistic regression analysis. Neuroradiological characteristics and AD-related changes in the right frontal cortical brain biopsies were available for further analysis.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis adjusted to age, gender, and other SNPs indicated allelic variation of NME8 between iNPH patients and non-demented controls (p = 0.014). The allelic variation of NME8 was not related to the neuropathological changes in the brain biopsies of iNPH patients. However, periventricular white matter changes (p = 0.017) were more frequent in the iNPH patients with the AA-genotype, an identified risk factor of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings increase the evidence that iNPH is characterized by genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms independent from AD. Considering that NME8 plays a role in the ciliary function and displays SNP-related diversity in white matter changes, the mechanisms of NME8 in iNPH and other neurodegenerative processes are worth further study.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
28984593,Exploring Erythrocytes as Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Peripheral biomarkers for dementia are few and far between. Despite research into blood plasma/serum biomarkers for dementia diagnostics, there is a lack of information on erythrocytes and their vast proteomes as potential biomarkers. This review identifies a number of relevant and potentially promising erythrocyte biomarkers for various subtypes of dementia. These include erythrocyte morphology, oxidative stress, and erythrocyte membrane proteins such as the glucose transporter (GLUT-1), amyloid-β, IgG, Hsp90, calpain-1, and band 3 protein. Of those proteins identified Hsp90, amyloid-β, calpain-1 and band 3 show the most promise as pre-clinical biomarkers. However, the most intriguing aspect of erythrocytes is their changed morphology in dementia. The altered morphology not only could be used as a diagnostic biomarker but may be crucial in early pathogenesis of the disease. Further work must be done to establish the pathological connection between the periphery and central disease processes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
29081416,Cost-Utility of Using Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid to Predict Progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic research criteria for Alzheimer's disease support the use of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to improve the accuracy of the prognosis regarding progression to dementia for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding CSF biomarker testing to the standard diagnostic workup to determine the prognosis for patients with MCI.
METHODS: In an early technology assessment, a mathematical simulation model was built, using available evidence on added prognostic value as well as expert opinion to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 20,000 virtual MCI patients with (intervention strategy) and without (control strategy) relying on CSF, from a health-care sector perspective and with a 5-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Adding the CSF test improved the accuracy of prognosis by 11%. This resulted in an average QALY gain of 0.046 and € 432 additional costs per patient, representing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 9,416.
CONCLUSION: The results show the potential of CSF biomarkers in current practice from a health-economics perspective. This result was, however, marked by a high degree of uncertainty, and empirical research is required into the impact of a prognosis on worrying, false-positive/negative prognosis, and stigmatization.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
29036817,Initial Heart Rate Reactivity to Socioemotional Pictures in Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often have generalized anxiety, particularly in early-onset AD (EOAD) or the first stages of their disease. This increased anxiety could be associated with decreased sensorimotor gating with increased attention to significant stimuli from AD pathology in the entorhinal cortex. We investigated whether widening initial attention to socioemotional stimuli was association with anxiety among 16 patients with first stage EOAD compared to 19 normal controls (NCs). The participants underwent assessment of their initial heart rate deceleration (""orienting response""; OR), a measure of attentional refocusing, to pictures (International Affective Picture Stimuli) varying in pleasant-unpleasant valence and social-nonsocial content. The results showed group differences; the EOAD patients had significantly larger ORs than the NCs across conditions, with larger ORs in each valence and social condition. In addition, the EOAD patients, but not the NCs, showed ORs to normally less threatening stimuli, particularly pleasant, but also less significantly, social stimuli. On the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the ORs among the EOAD patients significantly correlated with anxiety scores. Together, these findings suggest that anxiety in mild EOAD may be associated with widening attentional refocusing to socioemotional stimuli, possibly reflecting decreased sensorimotor gating in the entorhinal cortex. This finding could be a potential biomarker for the first stages of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
29036819,Age and Graphomotor Decision Making Assessed with the Digital Clock Drawing Test: The Framingham Heart Study.,"BACKGROUND: Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) technology enables the examination of detailed neurocognitive behavior as behavior unfolds in real time; a capability that cannot be obtained using a traditional pen and paper testing format.
OBJECTIVE: Parameters obtained from the dCDT were used to investigate neurocognitive constructs related to higher-order neurocognitive decision making and information processing speed. The current research sought to determine the effect of age as related to combined motor and non-motor components of drawing, and higher-order decision making latencies.
METHODS: A large group of stroke- and dementia- free Framingham Heart Study participants were administered the dCDT to command and copy with hands set for ""10 after 11"". Six age groups (age range 28-98) were constructed.
RESULTS: Differences between age groups were found for total time to completion, total pen stroke count, and higher-order decision making latencies in both command and copy test conditions.
CONCLUSION: Longer age-related decision making latencies may reflect a greater need for working memory and increased self-monitoring in older subjects. These latency measures have potential to serve as neurocognitive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and other insidious neurodegenerative disorders.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
29081415,Cortical Iron Reflects Severity of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Abnormal iron distribution in the isocortex is increasingly recognized as an in vivo marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the contribution of iron accumulation to the AD pathology is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated: 1) frontal cortical iron distribution in AD and normal aging and 2) the relation between iron distribution and degree of AD pathology. We used formalin fixed paraffin embedded frontal cortex from 10 AD patients, 10 elder, 10 middle aged, and 10 young controls and visualized iron with a modified Perl's histochemical procedure. AD and elderly subjects were not different with respect to age and sex distribution. Iron distribution in the frontal cortex was not affected by normal aging but was clearly different between AD and controls. AD showed accumulation of iron in plaques, activated microglia, and, in the most severe cases, in the mid-cortical layers along myelinated fibers. The degree of altered iron accumulations was correlated to the amount of amyloid-β plaques and tau pathology in the same block, as well as to Braak stage (p < 0.001). AD and normal aging show different iron and myelin distribution in frontal cortex. These changes appear to occur after the development of the AD pathological hallmarks. These findings may help the interpretation of high resolution in vivo MRI and suggest the potential of using changes in iron-based MRI contrast to indirectly determine the degree of AD pathology in the frontal cortex.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
29423338,Static and Dynamic Cognitive Reserve Proxy Measures: Interactions with Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Cognition.,"OBJECTIVE: Years of education are the most common proxy for measuring cognitive reserve (CR) when assessing the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and cognition. However, years of education may be limited as a CR proxy given that it represents a specific timeframe in early life and is static. Studies suggest that measures of intellectual function provide a dynamic estimate of CR that is superior to years of education since it captures the effect of continued learning over time. The present study determined whether dynamic measures of CR were better predictors of episodic memory and executive function in the presence of AD pathology than a static measure of CR.
METHODS: Subjects examined died with a pre-mortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impaired, mild cognitive impairment and mild to moderate AD. CERAD and Braak stage were used to stratify the sample by AD pathology severity. Linear regression analyses using CR by CERAD and CR by Braak stage interaction terms were used to determine whether Extended Range Vocabulary Test (ERVT) scores or years of education were significantly associated with episodic memory composite (EMC) and executive function composite (EFC) performance. All models were adjusted for clinical diagnosis, age at death, gender, APOE e4 carrier status and Braak stage.
RESULTS: For episodic memory, years of education by CERAD interaction were not statistically significant (β=-0.01, SE=0.01, p=0.53). By contrast, ERVT interaction with CERAD diagnosis was statistically significant (β=-0.03, SE=0.01, p=0.004). Among the models using Braak stages, none of the CR by pathology interactions were associated with EMC or EFC.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a dynamic rather than a static measure is a better indicator of CR and that the relationship between CR and cognition is dependent upon the severity of select AD criteria.",J Alzheimers Dis Parkinsonism,2017
29215310,Apolipoprotein E4 mediates insulin resistance-associated cerebrovascular dysfunction and the post-prandial response.,"Metabolic dysfunction, commonly a result of diets high in saturated fats and sugar, is associated with impaired cognitive function and an increased risk of age-related cognitive decline (ACD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared to the E3 isoform of apolipoprotein (apoE), the E4 isoform is a major genetic risk factor for ACD, AD, and for developing cognitive impairments following various environmental challenges, including dietary challenges such as a high-fat diet (HFD). Both insulin resistance (IR) and E4 are associated with metabolic and vascular impairments. Deficits in cerebral metabolism and cerebrovascular function have been proposed as initiating events leading to these impairments. In the current study, we employed a model of human apoE targeted replacement mice and HFD-induced obesity to study the potential link between E4 and IR, at rest and following a postprandial challenge. HFD-induced IR was associated with impaired cognition, reduced cerebral blood volume and decreased glucose uptake. These effects were more profound in E4 than E3 mice. Furthermore, the cognitive, metabolic and cerebrovascular responses to an exogenous glucose load showed an apoE isoform-dependent response, with E4, but not E3 mice, acutely benefiting from a spike in blood glucose.",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,2017
27906568,Lower Death Risk for Vascular Dementia Than for Alzheimer's Disease With Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Users.,"CONTEXT: There are conflicting data on postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and the risk of vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the mortality risk attributable to VD or AD in women with a history of HT use.
DESIGN, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Finnish women (n = 489,105) using systemic HT in 1994 to 2009 were identified from the nationwide drug reimbursement register. Of these women, 581 died of VD and 1057 of AD from 1998 to 2009. Observed deaths in HT users with <5 or ≥5 years of exposure were compared with deaths that occurred in the age-standardized female population. Furthermore, we compared the VD or AD death risk of women who had started HT at <60 vs ≥60 years of age.
RESULTS: Risk of death from VD was reduced by 37% to 39% (<5 or ≥5 years of exposure) with the use of any systemic HT, and this reduction was not associated with the duration or type (estradiol only or estradiol-progestin combination) of HT. Risk of death from AD was not reduced with systemic HT use <5 years, but was slightly reduced (15%) if HT exposure exceeded 5 years. Age at systemic HT initiation (<60 vs ≥60 years) did not affect the death risk reductions.
CONCLUSION: Estradiol-based HT use is associated with a reduced risk of death from both VD and AD, but the risk reduction is larger and appears sooner in VD than AD.",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,2017
29142143,DHA supplementation improves cognitive function via enhancing Aβ-mediated autophagy in Chinese elderly with mild cognitive impairment: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Higher docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake is inversely correlated with relative risk of Alzheimer's disease. The potential benefits of DHA supplementation in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been fully examined.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess the effect of a 24-month DHA supplementation on cognitive function and amyloid beta (Aβ)-mediated autophagy in elderly subjects with MCI.
METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Tianjin, China. A total of 240 individuals with MCI were identified and randomly divided into intervention (DHA 2 g/day, n=120) and control (corn oil as placebo, n=120) groups. Cognitive function and blood Aβ-related biomarkers were measured at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equation.
RESULTS: A total of 217 participants (DHA: 109, placebo: 108) completed the trial. During the follow-up, scores of full-scale IQ, verbal IQ and subdomains of information and digit span were significantly higher in the intervention group than the convention group (p<0.05). In the intervention group, blood Aβ-42 level and expression of Aβ protein precursor mRNA were decreased (p<0.05), while Beclin-1 and LC3-II levels and expression of LC3-II mRNA were increased (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Daily oral DHA supplementation (2 g/day) for 24 months may improve cognitive function and change blood biomarker-related Aβ-mediated autophagy in people with MCI. Larger longer-term confirmatory studies are warranted.

28418521,Evaluation of Amyloid Protective Factors and Alzheimer Disease Neurodegeneration Protective Factors in Elderly Individuals.,"IMPORTANCE: While amyloid and neurodegeneration are viewed together as Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (ADP), the factors that influence amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration may be considerably different. Protection from these ADP factors may be important for aging without significant ADP.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the combined and independent protective factors for amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration in a population-based sample and to test the hypothesis that ""exceptional agers"" with advanced ages do not have significant ADP because they have protective factors for amyloid and neurodegeneration.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study conducted a prospective analysis of 942 elderly individuals (70-≥90 years) with magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography scans enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study of cognitive aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We operationalized ""exceptional aging"" without ADP by considering individuals 85 years or older to be without significant evidence of ADP.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated predictors including demographics, APOE, intellectual enrichment, midlife risk factors (physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia), and the total number of late-life cardiac and metabolic conditions. We used multivariate linear regression models to identify the combined and independent protective factors for amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration. Using a subsample of the cohort 85 years of age or older, we computed Cohen d-based effect size estimations to compare the quantitative strength of each predictor variable in their contribution with exceptional aging without ADP.
RESULTS: The study participants included 423 (45%) women and the average age of participants was 79.7 (5.9) years. Apart from demographics and the APOE genotype, only midlife dyslipidemia was associated with amyloid deposition. Obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac and metabolic conditions, but not intellectual enrichment, were associated with greater AD-pattern neurodegeneration. In the 85 years or older cohort, the Cohen d results showed small to moderate effects (effect sizes > 0.2) of several variables except job score and midlife hypertension in predicting exceptional aging without ADP.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The protective factors that influence amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration are different. ""Exceptional aging"" without ADP may be possible with a greater number of protective factors across the lifespan but warrants further investigation.",JAMA Neurol,2017
29049480,Interpreting Biomarker Results in Individual Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment in the Alzheimer's Biomarkers in Daily Practice (ABIDE) Project.,"IMPORTANCE: Biomarkers do not determine conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) perfectly, and criteria do not specify how to take patient characteristics into account. Consequently, biomarker use may be challenging for clinicians, especially in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: To construct biomarker-based prognostic models that enable determination of future AD dementia in patients with MCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is part of the Alzheimer's Biomarkers in Daily Practice (ABIDE) project. A total of 525 patients with MCI from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (longitudinal cohort, tertiary referral center) were studied. All patients had their baseline visit to a memory clinic from September 1, 1997, through August 31, 2014. Prognostic models were constructed by Cox proportional hazards regression with patient characteristics (age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers (hippocampal volume, normalized whole-brain volume), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (amyloid-β1-42, tau), and combined biomarkers. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2015, to October 1, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical end points were AD dementia and any type of dementia after 1 and 3 years.
RESULTS: Of the 525 patients, 210 (40.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 67.3 (8.4) years. On the basis of age, sex, and MMSE score only, the 3-year progression risk to AD dementia ranged from 26% (95% CI, 19%-34%) in younger men with MMSE scores of 29 to 76% (95% CI, 65%-84%) in older women with MMSE scores of 24 (1-year risk: 6% [95% CI, 4%-9%] to 24% [95% CI, 18%-32%]). Three- and 1-year progression risks were 86% (95% CI, 71%-95%) and 27% (95% CI, 17%-41%) when MRI results were abnormal, 82% (95% CI, 73%-89%) and 26% (95% CI, 20%-33%) when CSF test results were abnormal, and 89% (95% CI, 79%-95%) and 26% (95% CI, 18%-36%) when the results of both tests were abnormal. Conversely, 3- and 1-year progression risks were 18% (95% CI, 13%-27%) and 3% (95% CI, 2%-5%) after normal MRI results, 6% (95% CI, 3%-9%) and 1% (95% CI, 0.5%-2%) after normal CSF test results, and 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%) and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-1%) after combined normal MRI and CSF test results. The prognostic value of models determining any type of dementia were in the same order of magnitude although somewhat lower. External validation in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 showed that our models were highly robust.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides biomarker-based prognostic models that may help determine AD dementia and any type of dementia in patients with MCI at the individual level.

28660589,On Electrochemical Methods for Determination of Protein-Lipid Interaction.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are important and reliable molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. Aggregation and fibrillization of Aβ peptides on ganglioside GM1 (GM1)-containing lipid membranes is considered a cause of neurodegenerative disease. Because GM1 is abundant in the central nervous system and plays a key role in the aggregation of Aβ, the interaction of Aβ with supported planar lipid bilayers (SPBs) containing GM1 is of great significance. We have prepared SPBs containing GM1 in order to study the electrochemical characteristics of GM1/sphingomyelin/cholesterol SPBs and their interaction with Aβ(1-40) by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which proves that electrochemical is a promising method for analyzing the interaction between peptides and lipid membranes.",Methods Mol Biol,2017
29157277,A validated antibody panel for the characterization of tau post-translational modifications.,"BACKGROUND: Tau is a microtubule-binding protein, which is subject to various post-translational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, nitration, sumoylation and truncation. Aberrant PTMs such as hyperphosphorylation result in tau aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to study the importance of PTMs on tau function, antibodies raised against specific modification sites are widely used. However, quality control of these antibodies is lacking and their specificity for particular modifications is often unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we first designed an online tool called 'TauPTM', which enables the visualization of PTMs and their interactions on human tau. Using TauPTM, we next searched for commercially available antibodies against tau PTMs and characterized their specificity by peptide array, immunoblotting, electrochemiluminescence ELISA and immunofluorescence technologies.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that commercially available antibodies can show a significant lack of specificity, and PTM-specific antibodies in particular often recognize non-modified versions of the protein. In addition, detection may be hindered by other PTMs in close vicinity, complicating the interpretation of results. Finally, we compiled a panel of specific antibodies and show that they are useful to detect PTM-modified endogenous tau in hiPSC-derived neurons and mouse brains.
CONCLUSION: This study has created a platform to reliably and robustly detect changes in localization and abundance of post-translationally modified tau in health and disease. A web-based version of TauPTM is fully available at http://www.tauptm.org .",Mol Neurodegener,2017
29215007,Multivalent cross-linking of actin filaments and microtubules through the microtubule-associated protein Tau.,"Microtubule-associated proteins regulate microtubule dynamics, bundle actin filaments, and cross-link actin filaments with microtubules. In addition, aberrant interaction of the microtubule-associated protein Tau with filamentous actin is connected to synaptic impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Here we provide insight into the nature of interaction between Tau and actin filaments. We show that Tau uses several short helical segments to bind in a dynamic, multivalent process to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. Although a single Tau helix is sufficient to bind to filamentous actin, at least two, flexibly linked helices are required for actin bundling. In agreement with a structural model of Tau repeat sequences in complex with actin filaments, phosphorylation at serine 262 attenuates binding of Tau to filamentous actin. Taken together the data demonstrate that bundling of filamentous actin and cross-linking of the cellular cytoskeleton depend on the metamorphic and multivalent nature of microtubule-associated proteins.",Nat Commun,2017
28092683,Case-control association mapping by proxy using family history of disease.,"Collecting cases for case-control genetic association studies can be time-consuming and expensive. In some situations (such as studies of late-onset or rapidly lethal diseases), it may be more practical to identify family members of cases. In randomly ascertained cohorts, replacing cases with their first-degree relatives enables studies of diseases that are absent (or nearly absent) in the cohort. We refer to this approach as genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX) and apply it to 12 common diseases in 116,196 individuals from the UK Biobank. Meta-analysis with published genome-wide association study summary statistics replicated established risk loci and yielded four newly associated loci for Alzheimer's disease, eight for coronary artery disease and five for type 2 diabetes. In addition to informing disease biology, our results demonstrate the utility of association mapping without directly observing cases. We anticipate that GWAX will prove useful in future genetic studies of complex traits in large population cohorts.",Nat Genet,2017
28504673,A fluoro-Nissl dye identifies pericytes as distinct vascular mural cells during in vivo brain imaging.,"Pericytes and smooth muscle cells are integral components of the brain microvasculature. However, no techniques exist to unambiguously identify these cell types, greatly limiting their investigation in vivo. Here we show that the fluorescent Nissl dye NeuroTrace 500/525 labels brain pericytes with specificity, allowing high-resolution optical imaging in the live mouse. We demonstrate that capillary pericytes are a population of mural cells with distinct morphological, molecular and functional features that do not overlap with precapillary or arteriolar smooth muscle actin-expressing cells. The remarkable specificity for dye uptake suggests that pericytes have molecular transport mechanisms not present in other brain cells. We demonstrate feasibility of longitudinal pericyte imaging during microvascular development and aging and in models of brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease. The ability to easily label pericytes in any mouse model opens the possibility of a broad range of investigations of mural cells in vascular development, neurovascular coupling and neuropathology.",Nat Neurosci,2017

29246792,Association of GPX1 and GPX4 polymorphisms with episodic memory and Alzheimer's disease.,"It is well established that healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with substantial declines in episodic memory. However, there is still debate about the roles of GPX1 and GPX4 polymorphisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of rs1050450 and rs713041 polymorphisms with memory. This research was composed of a cross-sectional study (334 subjects) and a case-control study (108 healthy controls and 103 with AD-NINCDS/ARDA, DSM-IV-TR criteria). For the association of the genetic polymorphisms with memory or cognitive loss, the phenotypes were analyzed as follows: 1) each memory as a quantitative trait; 2) presence of deficit on a specific memory; 3) presence of MCI; 4) presence of AD. To assess verbal learning and the ability to store new information, we used the Rey Verbal Learning Test. Scores were recorded as a function of age as in the WMS-R testing battery. DNA was obtained from whole blood, and genotypes for GPX1 (rs1050450) and GPX4 (rs713041) were detected by allelic discrimination assay using TaqMan<sup>®</sup> MGB probes on a real-time PCR system. GPX1 TT homozygotes had lower long-term visual memory scores than CC/CT group (-0.28 ± 1.03 vs. 0.13 ± 1.03, respectively, p = 0.017). For the GPX4 rs713041, the frequency of the TT genotype was higher in the group with normal scores than in the group with long-term visual memory deficits (p = 0.025). In a multivariate logistic regression, GPX1 CC homozygotes had a 2.85 higher chance of developing AD (OR = 2.85, CI95% = 1.04-7.78, p = 0.041) in comparison to the reference genotype. No significant differences were observed regarding the MCI group between genetic variants. This study is one of the first to show that polymorphisms in GPX1 and GPX4 are significantly associated with episodic memory and AD in a South Brazilian population.",Neurosci Lett,2017
28678786,Bidirectional interplay of HSF1 degradation and UPR activation promotes tau hyperphosphorylation.,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cytoplasmic heat stress response are two major stress response systems necessary for maintaining proteostasis for cellular health. Failure of either of these systems, such as in sustained UPR activation or in insufficient heat shock response activation, can lead to the development of neurodegeneration. Alleviation of ER stress and enhancement of heat shock response through heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activation have previously been considered as attractive potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-a prevalent and devastating tauopathy. Understanding the interplay of the two aforementioned systems and their cooperative role in AD remain elusive. Here we report studies in human brain and tau pathogenic mouse models (rTg4510, PS19, and rTg21221), identifying HSF1 degradation and UPR activation as precursors of aberrant tau pathogenesis. We demonstrate that chemical ER stress inducers caused autophagy-lysosomal HSF1 degradation, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation in rat primary neurons. In addition, permanent HSF1 loss reversely causes chronic UPR activation, leading to aberrant tau phosphorylation and aggregation in the hippocampus of aged HSF1 heterozygous knock-out mice. The deleterious interplay of UPR activation and HSF1 loss is exacerbated in N2a cells stably overexpressing a pro-aggregation mutant TauRD ΔK280 (N2a-TauRD ΔK280). We provide evidence of how these two stress response systems are intrinsically interweaved by showing that the gene encoding C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) activation in the UPR apoptotic pathway facilitates HSF1 degradation, which likely further contributes to prolonged UPR via ER chaperone HSP70 a5 (BiP/GRP78) suppression. Upregulating HSF1 relieves the tau toxicity in N2a-TauRD ΔK280 by reducing CHOP and increasing HSP70 a5 (BiP/GRP78). Our work reveals how the bidirectional crosstalk between the two stress response systems promotes early tau pathology and identifies HSF1 being one likely key player in both systems.",PLoS Genet,2017
28323825,Association between fatty acid metabolism in the brain and Alzheimer disease neuropathology and cognitive performance: A nontargeted metabolomic study.,"BACKGROUND: The metabolic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and expression of AD symptoms is poorly understood. Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids have previously been linked to both protective and pathogenic effects in AD. However, to date little is known about how the abundance of these species is affected by differing levels of disease pathology in the brain.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed metabolic profiling on brain tissue samples from 43 individuals ranging in age from 57 to 95 y old who were stratified into three groups: AD (N = 14), controls (N = 14) and ""asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease"" (ASYMAD), i.e., individuals with significant AD neuropathology at death but without evidence for cognitive impairment during life (N = 15) from the autopsy sample of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We measured 4,897 metabolite features in regions both vulnerable in the middle frontal and inferior temporal gyri (MFG and ITG) and resistant (cerebellum) to classical AD pathology. The levels of six unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in whole brain were compared in controls versus AD, and the differences were as follows: linoleic acid (p = 8.8 x 10-8, FC = 0.52, q = 1.03 x 10-6), linolenic acid (p = 2.5 x 10-4, FC = 0.84, q = 4.03 x 10-4), docosahexaenoic acid (p = 1.7 x 10-7, FC = 1.45, q = 1.24 x 10-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (p = 4.4 x 10-4, FC = 0.16, q = 6.48 x 10-4), oleic acid (p = 3.3 x 10-7, FC = 0.34, q = 1.46 x 10-6), and arachidonic acid (p = 2.98 x 10-5, FC = 0.75, q = 7.95 x 10-5). These fatty acids were strongly associated with AD when comparing the groups in the MFG and ITG, respectively: linoleic acid (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0006), linolenic acid (p < 0.0001, p = 0.002), docosahexaenoic acid (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0024), eicosapentaenoic acid (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0008), oleic acid (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0003), and arachidonic acid (p = 0.0001, p = 0.001). Significant associations were also observed between the abundance of these UFAs with neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden as well as domain-specific cognitive performance assessed during life. Based on the regional pattern of differences in brain tissue levels of these metabolites, we propose that alterations in UFA metabolism represent both global metabolic perturbations in AD as well as those related to specific features of AD pathology. Within the middle frontal gyrus, decrements in linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid (control>ASYMAD>AD) and increases in docosahexanoic acid (AD>ASYMAD>control) may represent regionally specific threshold levels of these metabolites beyond which the accumulation of AD pathology triggers the expression of clinical symptoms. The main limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. There are few cohorts with extensive longitudinal cognitive assessments during life and detailed neuropathological assessments at death, such as the BLSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that unsaturated fatty acid metabolism is significantly dysregulated in the brains of patients with varying degrees of Alzheimer pathology.",PLoS Med,2017
28350821,Neuropathological diagnoses and clinical correlates in older adults in Brazil: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinicopathological studies are important in determining the brain lesions underlying dementia. Although almost 60% of individuals with dementia live in developing countries, few clinicopathological studies focus on these individuals. We investigated the frequency of neurodegenerative and vascular-related neuropathological lesions in 1,092 Brazilian admixed older adults, their correlation with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cross-sectional study, we describe clinical and neuropathological variables related to cognitive impairment in 1,092 participants (mean age = 74 y, 49% male, 69% white, and mean education = 4 y). Cognitive function was investigated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE); neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Associations between neuropathological lesions and cognitive impairment were investigated using ordinal logistic regression. We developed a neuropathological comorbidity (NPC) score and compared it to CDR, IQCODE, and NPI scores. We also described and compared the frequency of neuropathological diagnosis to clinical diagnosis of dementia subtype. Forty-four percent of the sample met criteria for neuropathological diagnosis. Among these participants, 50% had neuropathological diagnoses of Alzheimer disease (AD), and 35% of vascular dementia (VaD). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), hippocampal sclerosis, lacunar infarcts, hyaline atherosclerosis, siderocalcinosis, and Lewy body disease were independently associated with cognitive impairment. Higher NPC scores were associated with worse scores in the CDR sum of boxes (β = 1.33, 95% CI 1.20-1.46), IQCODE (β = 0.14, 95% CI 0.13-0.16), and NPI (β = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.33-2.16). Compared to neuropathological diagnoses, clinical diagnosis had high sensitivity to AD and high specificity to dementia with Lewy body/Parkinson dementia. The major limitation of our study is the lack of clinical follow-up of participants during life.
CONCLUSIONS: NFT deposition, vascular lesions, and high NPC scorewere associated with cognitive impairment in a unique Brazilian sample with low education. Our results confirm the high prevalence of neuropathological diagnosis in older adults and the mismatch between clinical and neuropathological diagnoses.",PLoS Med,2017

Transgenic manipulation of methylation of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP2A, was recently shown to alter the sensitivity of mice to AD-related impairments resulting from acute exposure to elevated levels of Aβ. In addition, eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide (EHT), a naturally occurring component from coffee beans that modulates PP2A methylation, was shown to confer therapeutic benefits in rodent models of AD and Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EHT protects animals from the pathological effects of exposure to elevated levels of soluble oligomeric Aβ. We treated mice with EHT-containing food at two different doses and assessed the sensitivity of these animals to Aβ-induced behavioral and electrophysiological impairments. We found that EHT administration protected animals from Aβ-induced cognitive impairments in both a radial-arm water maze and contextual fear conditioning task. We also found that both chronic and acute EHT administration prevented Aβ-induced impairments in long-term potentiation. These data add to the accumulating evidence suggesting that interventions with pharmacological agents, such as EHT, that target PP2A activity may be therapeutically beneficial for AD and other neurological conditions.",PLoS One,2017

We performed inter-species comparative gene expression profiling between AD patient brains and the App <sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> and 3xTg-AD-H mouse models. Genes commonly altered in App <sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> and human AD cortices correlated with the inflammatory response or immunological disease. Among them, expression of AD-related genes (C4a/C4b, Cd74, Ctss, Gfap, Nfe2l2, Phyhd1, S100b, Tf, Tgfbr2, and Vim) was increased in the App <sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> cortex as Aβ amyloidosis progressed with exacerbated gliosis, while genes commonly altered in the 3xTg-AD-H and human AD cortices correlated with neurological disease.

In the present study, we investigated the putative association between sNSE levels, body mass index (BMI), total gray matter volume (GMV), and magnetic resonance imaging-based indices of aging as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like patterns.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: sNSE was determined in 901 subjects (499 women, 22-81 years, BMI 18-48 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), participating in a population-based study (SHIP-TREND). We report age-specific patterns of sNSE levels between males and females. Females showed augmenting, males decreasing sNSE levels associated with age (males: p = 0.1052, females: p = 0.0363). sNSE levels and BMI were non-linearly associated, showing a parabolic association and decreasing sNSE levels at BMI values &gt;25 (p = 0.0056). In contrast to our hypotheses, sNSE levels were not associated with total GMV, aging, or AD-like patterns. Pathomechanisms discussed are: sex-specific hormonal differences, neuronal damage/differentiation, or impaired cerebral glucose metabolism. We assume a sex-dependence of age-related effects to the brain. Further, we propose in accordance to previous studies an actual neuronal damage in the early stages of obesity. However, with progression of overweight, we assume more profound effects of excess body fat to the brain.",Transl Psychiatry,2017
30478624,The role of de novo mutations in adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders.,"The genetic underpinnings of the most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders (AOND) are complex in majority of the cases. In some families, however, the disease can be inherited in a Mendelian fashion as an autosomal-dominant trait. Next to that, patients carrying mutations in the same disease genes have been reported despite a negative family history. Although challenging to demonstrate due to the late onset of the disease in most cases, the occurrence of de novo mutations can explain this sporadic presentation, as demonstrated for severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Exome or genome sequencing of patient-parent trios allows a hypothesis-free study of the role of de novo mutations in AOND and the discovery of novel disease genes. Another hypothesis that may explain a proportion of sporadic AOND cases is the occurrence of a de novo mutation after the fertilization of the oocyte (post-zygotic mutation) or even as a late-somatic mutation, restricted to the brain. Such somatic mutation hypothesis, that can be tested with the use of novel sequencing technologies, is fully compatible with the seeding and spreading mechanisms of the pathological proteins identified in most of these disorders. We review here the current knowledge and future perspectives on de novo mutations in known and novel candidate genes identified in the most common AONDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum and Prion disorders. Also, we review the first lessons learned from recent genomic studies of control and diseased brains and the challenges which remain to be addressed.",Acta Neuropathol,2018
30238240,Epitope determines efficacy of therapeutic anti-Tau antibodies in a functional assay with human Alzheimer Tau.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, the cytosolic protein Tau misfolds and forms intracellular aggregates which accumulate within the brain leading to neurodegeneration. Clinical progression is tightly linked to the progressive spread of Tau pathology throughout the brain, and several lines of evidence suggest that Tau aggregates or ""seeds"" may propagate pathology by spreading from cell to cell in a ""prion like"" manner. Accordingly, blocking the spread of extracellular seeds with an antibody could be a viable therapeutic approach. However, as the structure of Tau seeds is unknown, it is only possible to rationally design therapeutic Tau antibodies by making a priori assumptions. To avoid this, we developed a robust and quantitative cell based assay and employed an unbiased screening approach to identify the antibody with the highest activity against human Tau seeds. The selected antibody (D), directed to the mid-region of Tau (amino acids 235-250), potently blocked the seeding of human AD Tau and was also fully efficacious against seeds from progressive supranuclear palsy. When we compared this antibody with previously described reference antibodies, we were surprised to find that none of these antibodies showed comparable efficacy against human pathological seeds. Our data highlight the difficulty of predicting antibody accessible epitopes on pathological Tau seeds and question the potential efficacy of some of the Tau antibodies that are currently in clinical development.",Acta Neuropathol,2018
30334074,Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease and common neuropathologies of aging.,"Alzheimer's dementia is significantly more common in women than in men. However, few pathological studies have addressed sex difference in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other brain pathologies. We leveraged postmortem data from 1453 persons who participated in one of two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Postmortem examination identified AD pathologies, neocortical Lewy bodies, DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), hippocampal sclerosis, gross and micro infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Linear and logistic regressions examined the association of sex with each of the pathologic measures. Two-thirds of subjects were women (n = 971; 67%), with a mean age at death of 89.8 (SD = 6.6) years in women and 87.3 (SD = 6.6) in men. Adjusted for age and education, women had higher levels on a global measure of AD pathology (estimate = 0.102, SE = 0.022, p < 0.001), and tau tangle density in particular (estimate = 0.334, SE = 0.074, p < 0.001), and there was a borderline difference between women and men in amyloid-β load (estimate = 0.124, SE = 0.065, p = 0.056). In addition, compared to men, women were more likely to have more severe arteriolosclerosis (OR = 1.28, 95% CI:1.04-1.58, p = 0.018), and less likely to have gross infarcts (OR = 0.78, 95% CI:0.61-0.98, p = 0.037), although the association with gross infarct was attenuated after controlling for vascular risk factors. These data help elucidate the neuropathologic footprint of sex difference in AD and other common brain pathologies of aging.",Acta Neuropathol,2018
31942484,Functional MRI technologies in the study of medication treatment effect on Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of late-life dementia. Characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, the disease is expressed as gradual memory loss together with decline in cognitive abilities and other brain functions. Despite extensive research over the past decade, the cause and cure of AD both remain largely unknown. Several AD-associated deficits have been targeted for interventions, including those based on amyloid-beta, tau, and inflammation hypotheses. Only 2 types of medications-cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine-have been approved, to control the cognitive symptoms of AD such as the loss of memory, language, and executive function. Noninvasive in vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, including the blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI, arterial spin labeling-based perfusion MRI, and the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been used to study the effect of ChEIs and memantine in the brain. Most of these studies have demonstrated increased functional activation and connectivity, increased regional brain blood flow and volume post-treatment, and positive responses of critical brain metabolites reflecting neuronal status and functionality in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment. The findings have contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the medication treatments and support the crucial role of functional MRI technologies in the development and refinement of AD medication therapies.",Aging Med (Milton),2018
30465754,"Neuropathologic, genetic, and longitudinal cognitive profiles in primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is a recently described entity that can cause cognitive impairment in the absence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we compared neuropathological features, tau haplotypes, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, and cognitive profiles in age-matched subjects with PART and AD pathology.
METHODS: Brain autopsies (n = 183) were conducted on participants 85 years and older from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Participants, normal at enrollment, were followed with periodic cognitive evaluations until death.
RESULTS: Compared with AD, PART subjects showed significantly slower rates of decline on measures of memory, language, and visuospatial performance. They also showed lower APOE ε4 allele frequency (4.1% vs. 17.6%, P = .0046).
DISCUSSION: Our observations suggest that PART is separate from AD and its distinction will be important for the clinical management of patients with cognitive impairment and for public health care planning.",Alzheimers Dement,2018
30555031,Perspectives on ethnic and racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: Update and areas of immediate need.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are a global crisis facing the aging population and society as a whole. With the numbers of people with ADRDs predicted to rise dramatically across the world, the scientific community can no longer neglect the need for research focusing on ADRDs among underrepresented ethnoracial diverse groups. The Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART; alz.org/ISTAART) comprises a number of professional interest areas (PIAs), each focusing on a major scientific area associated with ADRDs. We leverage the expertise of the existing international cadre of ISTAART scientists and experts to synthesize a cross-PIA white paper that provides both a concise ""state-of-the-science"" report of ethnoracial factors across PIA foci and updated recommendations to address immediate needs to advance ADRD science across ethnoracial populations.",Alzheimers Dement,2018
30419228,Learnings about the complexity of extracellular tau aid development of a blood-based screen for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The tau protein plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is huge interest in measuring tau in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
METHODS: We developed a set of immunoassays to measure tau in specimens from humans diagnosed based on current best clinical and CSF biomarker criteria.
RESULTS: In CSF, mid-region- and N-terminal-detected tau predominated and rose in disease. In plasma, an N-terminal assay (NT1) detected elevated levels of tau in AD and AD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma NT1 measurements separated controls from AD-MCI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88) and AD (AUC = 0.96) in a discovery cohort and in a Validation Cohort (with AUCs = 0.79 and 0.75, respectively).
DISCUSSION: The forms of tau in CSF and plasma are distinct, but in each specimen type, the levels of certain fragments are increased in AD. Measurement of plasma NT1 tau should be aggressively pursued as a potential blood-based screening test for AD/AD-MCI.",Alzheimers Dement,2018
30581972,Retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness is nonlinearly associated with cognitive impairment in the community-dwelling elderly.,"INTRODUCTION: Thinning of optical coherence tomography-measured retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness has been found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the association of these retinal markers and cognition in nondemented elders may not be linear.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 227 community-dwelling elders (age 65+ years). Multivariable regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between retinal nerve fiber layer/GC-IPL and global/domain-specific cognition.
RESULTS: The performance of global cognition decreased as mean GC-IPL of bilateral eyes deviated from the sample mean (77.5 μm) (quadratic GC-IPL: β = -0.49 × 10<sup>-2</sup>; 95% confidence interval: -0.74 × 10<sup>-2</sup> to -0.23 × 10<sup>-2</sup>). Similar associations were also found for logical memory. No significant association was observed between retinal nerve fiber layer and cognition.
DISCUSSION: Either thinning or thickening of GC-IPL was associated with poor cognition in nondemented elderly (a U-shaped association). GC-IPL may serve as a noninvasive preclinical predictor of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2018
30567585,Heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease: consequence for drug trials?,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a heterogenous disorder with multiple phenotypes and genotypes, although they eventually converge to a final common clinicopathological endpoint. However, Alzheimer's disease drug trials do not account for the heterogeneity of the disease in trial design, impeding development of effective drugs.
DISCUSSION: Alzheimer's disease drug trials commonly have wide inclusion criteria that subsume multiple subtypes of the condition, with varying genotypes, phenotypes, and clinical courses. The outcome variables used in many trials may not be sensitive for the particular disease subtype and trials may not follow patients for the appropriate length of time necessary for the subtype of disease. Methods of stratifying treatment trial design to account for disease heterogeneity using algorithms incorporating demographics, neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical phenotypes, as well as more tailored outcome measures, are proposed to allow for personalized, precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease therapeutics development. Approaching Alzheimer's disease as a heterogenous disorder will likely improve yield in the search for effective treatments for the condition.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2018
30541327,Empowering Patients with Alzheimer's Disease To Avoid Unwanted Medical Care: A Look At The Dementia Care Triad.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia with acute medical problems, who have lost capacity and are without advance directives, are at risk of being over treated inhospitals. To deal with this growing demographic and ethical crisis, patients with dementia need to plan for their future medical care while they have capacity to do so. This article will examine the role of each member of the dementia care triad and how to empower the patient to participate in planning future medical care. A case will be made that physicians have the same professional disclosure obligations to dementia patients as they do to all other capable patients with terminal illnesses. Because there is little consensus about what facts should be included in a diagnostic disclosure, this article will offer a proposal to empower newly diagnosed patients with dementia with capacity to plan for their future medical care.",Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen,2018
30349858,Decreased plasma C-reactive protein levels in APOE ε4 allele carriers.,"OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a well-established risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we assessed the effects of APOE polymorphism on cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammation-related parameters in population-based cohorts.
METHODS: Association of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammation-related parameters with the APOE polymorphism in a large Finnish Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort and Finnish Geriatric Intervention study to prevent cognitive impairment and disability (FINGER) were investigated. Brain-specific effects were addressed in postmortem brain samples.
RESULTS: Individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele displayed significantly elevated serum/plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels. APOE ε3ε4 and ε4ε4 significantly associated with lower levels of plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Plasma amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) and reduced hs-CRP levels showed an association independently of the APOE status.
INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that the APOE ε4 allele associates with lower levels of hs-CRP in individuals without dementia. Moreover, Aβ42 may encompass anti-inflammatory effects reflected by reduced hs-CRP levels.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2018

30250861,Pre-amyloid stage of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals.,"OBJECTIVE: To study risk factors for decreasing aβ<sub>1-42</sub> concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cognitively unimpaired individuals with initially normal amyloid and tau markers, and to investigate whether such aβ1-42 decreases are associated with subsequent decline in cognition and other biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Cognitively normal subjects (n = 83, 75 ± 5 years, 35(42%) female) with normal CSF aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and tau and repeated CSF sampling were selected from ADNI. Subject level slopes of aβ<sub>1-42</sub> decreases were estimated with mixed models. We tested associations of baseline APP processing markers (BACE1 activity, aβ<sub>1-40</sub>, aβ<sub>1-38</sub> and sAPP β) and decreasing aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels by including an interaction term between time and APP marker. Associations between decreasing aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels and clinical decline (i.e., progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, MMSE, memory functioning) and biological decline (tau, hippocampal volume, glucose processing and amyloid PET) over a time period of 8-10 years were assessed.
RESULTS: Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels decreased annually with -4.6 ± 1 pg/mL. Higher baseline BACE1 activity (β(se) = -0.06(0.03), P &lt; 0.05), aβ<sub>1-40</sub> (β(se)= -0.11(.03), P &lt; 0.001), and aβ<sub>1-38</sub> levels (β(se) = -0.11(0.03), P &lt; 0.001) predicted faster decreasing aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. The fastest tertile of decreasing aβ<sub>1-42</sub> rates was associated with subsequent pathophysiological processes: 11(14%) subjects developed abnormal amyloid levels after 3 ± 1.7 years, showed increased risk for clinical progression (Hazard Ratio[95CI] = 4.8[1.1-21.0]), decreases in MMSE, glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume, and increased CSF tau and amyloid aggregation on PET (all P &lt; 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: Higher APP processing and fast decreasing aβ<sub>1-42</sub> could be among the earliest, pre-amyloid, pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2018
30200957,Dementia subtype and living well: results from the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) study.,"BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of symptoms across dementia subtypes has important implications for clinical practice and dementia research. Variation in subtypes and associated symptoms may influence the capability to live well for people with dementia and carers. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of dementia subtypes on the capability to live well for both people with dementia and their carers.
METHODS: The analysis was based on the 1283 dyads of community-dwelling people with dementia and carers in the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) project, a large cohort study in Great Britain. Capability to live well was defined using three measures: quality of life, life satisfaction and wellbeing. Structural equation modelling was used to investigate capability to live well in seven dementia subtypes: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), mixed AD/VaD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), Lewy body dementia (LBD) and unspecified/other, accounting for dyadic data structure and adjusting for age and sex, type of relationship between person with dementia and their carer and the number of chronic conditions.
RESULTS: The major subtypes in this study population were AD (56%), VaD (11%) and mixed AD/VaD (21%). Compared to participants with AD, people with non-AD subtypes generally reported a lower capability to live well. Carers for people with PDD (- 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 3.24, - 0.18) and LBD (- 2.29; 95% CI - 3.84, - 0.75) also reported a lower capability to live well than carers for people with AD. After adjusting for demographic factors and comorbidity, PDD (- 4.28; 95% CI - 5.65, - 2.91) and LBD (- 3.76; 95% CI - 5.14, - 2.39) continued to have the strongest impact on both people with dementia and their carers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a variation in capability to live well across dementia subtypes. It is important for care providers to consider different needs across subtypes. Health professionals who provide post-diagnostic support may need to pay more attention to the complex needs of people living with PDD and LBD and their carers.",BMC Med,2018
29028963,ZCCHC17 is a master regulator of synaptic gene expression in Alzheimer's disease.,"MOTIVATION: In an effort to better understand the molecular drivers of synaptic and neurophysiologic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we analyzed neuronal gene expression data from human AD brain tissue to identify master regulators of synaptic gene expression.
RESULTS: Master regulator analysis identifies ZCCHC17 as normally supporting the expression of a network of synaptic genes, and predicts that ZCCHC17 dysfunction in AD leads to lower expression of these genes. We demonstrate that ZCCHC17 is normally expressed in neurons and is reduced early in the course of AD pathology. We show that ZCCHC17 loss in rat neurons leads to lower expression of the majority of the predicted synaptic targets and that ZCCHC17 drives the expression of a similar gene network in humans and rats. These findings support a conserved function for ZCCHC17 between species and identify ZCCHC17 loss as an important early driver of lower synaptic gene expression in AD.

30423101,Quantitative trait loci identification for brain endophenotypes via new additive model with random networks.,"MOTIVATION: The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is critical to the study of causal relationships between genetic variations and disease abnormalities. We focus on identifying the QTLs associated to the brain endophenotypes in imaging genomics study for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Existing research works mainly depict the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the brain endophenotypes via the linear methods, which may introduce high bias due to the simplicity of the models. Since the influence of QTLs on brain endophenotypes is quite complex, it is desired to design the appropriate non-linear models to investigate the associations of genotypes and endophenotypes.
RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a new additive model to learn the non-linear associations between SNPs and brain endophenotypes in Alzheimer's disease. Our model can be flexibly employed to explain the non-linear influence of QTLs, thus is more adaptive for the complex distribution of the high-throughput biological data. Meanwhile, as an important computational learning theory contribution, we provide the generalization error analysis for the proposed approach. Unlike most previous theoretical analysis under independent and identically distributed samples assumption, our error bound is based on m-dependent observations, which is more appropriate for the high-throughput and noisy biological data. Experiments on the data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort demonstrate the promising performance of our approach for identifying biological meaningful SNPs.

30537760,"Effects of Light Treatment on Sleep, Cognition, Mood, and Behavior in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND: Bright light treatment is a therapeutic intervention mainly used to treat sleep and circadian disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Recently, a handful of studies also focused on the effect on cognition and behavior. Conflicting findings are reported in the literature, and no definite conclusions have been drawn about its specific therapeutic effect.
SUMMARY: The aim of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of available evidence in this field, highlighting the specific characteristics of effective bright light treatment. Eligible studies were required to assess at least one of the following outcome measures: sleep, cognition, mood, and/or behavior (e.g., depression, agitation). A total of 32 articles were included in this systematic review and identified as research intervention studies about light treatment in AD. The quality of the papers was evaluated based on the US Preventive Service Task Force guidelines. Key Messages: Overall, the current literature suggests that the effects of light treatment in AD patients are mixed and may be influenced by several factors, but with a general trend toward a positive effect. Bright light seems to be a promising intervention treatment without significant adverse effects; therefore, further well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed taking into account the highlighted recommendations.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,2018
30447261,Association of hippocampal volume with gait variability in pre-dementia and dementia stages of Alzheimer disease: Results from a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Decreased hippocampal volume is a biomarker of Alzheimer disease (AD). The association of hippocampal volume with gait variability across the spectrum of AD, especially in early stages, has been few studied. The study aims to examine the association of hippocampal volume with the coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride time in individuals with mild and moderate to severe subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (na-MCI), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), and mild to moderate AD dementia.
METHODS: 271 individuals (79 mild SCI, 68 moderate to severe SCI, 47 na-MCI, 42 a-MCI and 35 mild to moderate AD dementia) were included in this cross-sectional study. Hippocampal volume was quantified from a three-dimensional T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI. CoV of stride time was recorded at self-selected pace with an electronic walkway. Age, sex, body mass index, number of drugs daily taken, history of falls, walking speed, type of MRI scanner, total intracranial volume, and white matter volume abnormality were used as covariates.
RESULTS: Participants with moderate to severe SCI had a higher CoV of stride time compared to those with mild SCI and na-MCI (P < 0.010), and a higher hippocampal volume compared to other groups (P ≤ 0.001). Participants with moderate to severe SCI had increased hippocampal volume associated with increased CoV of stride time (coefficient of regression β = 0.750 with P = 0.041), while the other groups did not show any significant association.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between greater hippocampal volume (i.e., better brain morphological structure) and an increased stride time variability (i.e., worse gait performance) in individuals with moderate to severe SCI is reported. This association confirms the key role of the hippocampus in gait control and suggests an inefficient compensatory mechanism in early stages of pathological aging like AD.",Exp Gerontol,2018

29883038,Genetic interaction is associated with lower metabolic connectivity and memory impairment in clinically mild Alzheimer's disease.,"Metabolic connectivity as showed by [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) reflects neuronal connectivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic impact on metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks and its clinical-pathological relationships in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We separately investigated the modulation of 2 default mode subnetworks, as identified with independent component analysis, by comparing APOE-ε4 carriers to noncarriers with AD. We further analyzed the interaction effects of APOE (APOE-ε4 carriers vs noncarriers) with PICALM (rs3851179-GG vs rs3851179-A-allele carriers) on episodic memory (EM) deficits, reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) and decreased metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks. The metabolic connectivity in the ventral default mode network (vDMN) was positively correlated with EM scores (β =0.441, P &lt; .001). The APOE-ε4 carriers had significantly lower metabolic connectivity in the vDMN than the APOE-ε4 carriers (t(96) = -2.233, P = .028). There was an effect of the APOE-PICALM (rs3851179) interactions on reduced CMRgl in regions of vDMN (P &lt; .001), and on memory deficits (F<sub>3,93</sub> =5.568, P = .020). This study identified that PICALM may modulates memory deficits, reduced CMRgl and decreased metabolic connectivity in the vDMN in APOE-ε4 carriers.

29408999,"Hippocampal mutant APP and amyloid beta-induced cognitive decline, dendritic spine loss, defective autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial abnormalities in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","The purpose of our study was to determine the toxic effects of hippocampal mutant APP and amyloid beta (Aβ) in 12-month-old APP transgenic mice. Using rotarod and Morris water maze tests, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, Golgi-cox staining and transmission electron microscopy, we assessed cognitive behavior, protein levels of synaptic, autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, dendritic protein MAP2 and quantified dendritic spines and mitochondrial number and length in 12-month-old APP mice that express Swedish mutation. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring the levels of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, cytochrome c oxidase activity and mitochondrial ATP. Morris water maze and rotarod tests revealed that hippocampal learning and memory and motor learning and coordination were impaired in APP mice relative to wild-type (WT) mice. Increased levels of mitochondrial fission proteins, Drp1 and Fis1 and decreased levels of fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) biogenesis (PGC1α, NRF1, NRF2 and TFAM), autophagy (ATG5 and LC3BI, LC3BII), mitophagy (PINK1 and TERT), synaptic (synaptophysin and PSD95) and dendritic (MAP2) proteins were found in 12-month-old APP mice relative to age-matched non-transgenic WT mice. Golgi-cox staining analysis revealed that dendritic spines are significantly reduced. Transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly increased mitochondrial numbers and reduced mitochondrial length in APP mice. These findings suggest that hippocampal accumulation of mutant APP and Aβ is responsible for abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and defective biogenesis, reduced MAP2, autophagy, mitophagy and synaptic proteins and reduced dendritic spines and hippocampal-based learning and memory impairments, and mitochondrial structural and functional changes in 12-month-old APP mice.",Hum Mol Genet,2018
30507580,Spatial Navigation in the Elderly with Alzheimer's Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND: Spatial navigation is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows an individual to maintain independence by facilitating the safe movement from one place to another. It emerges as one of the first deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To compare spatial navigation performance in the healthy elderly and AD patients through use of the Floor Maze Test (FMT)- an easy-to-apply two-dimensional (2D) maze- and determine which cognitive and functional capacities were associated with performance in this task.
METHODS: The FMT was administered to 24 AD patients and 36 healthy controls. Spatial navigation was evaluated through the FMT. Functional capacity was evaluated through the Senior Fitness Test battery of tests. Cognitive functions were evaluated through the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), verbal fluency, digit span test, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT).
RESULTS: The group with AD was significantly slower and presented more errors at all stages of the FMT. Planning Time (PT) performance was associated with cardiorespiratory resistance (Step test) and delayed memory according to the RAVLT (R2 = 0.395, p < 0.001). Performance in the Immediate Maze Time (IMT) and Delayed Maze Time (DMT) was associated with global cognitive status (MMSE) (R2 = 0.509) and delayed memory (R2 = 0.540).
CONCLUSION: Patients with AD present significant spatial navigation deficits. Their performance on the FMT is influenced by cardiorespiratory capacity, memory, and global cognitive function. As exercise helps to improve executive function and functional capacity, future intervention studies should be carried out to analyze the possible effects of physical exercise on spatial navigation.",J Alzheimers Dis,2018
29185187,Extracellular Vesicle Biology in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Tauopathy.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are physiological vesicles secreted from most eukaryotes and contain cargos of their cell of origin. EVs, and particularly a subset of EV known as exosomes, are emerging as key mediators of cell to cell communication and waste management for cells both during normal organismal function and in disease. In this review, we investigate the rapidly growing field of exosome biology, their biogenesis, cargo loading, and uptake by other cells. We particularly consider the role of exosomes in Alzheimer's disease, both as a pathogenic agent and as a disease biomarker. We also explore the emerging role of exosomes in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we highlight open questions in these fields and the possible use of exosomes as therapeutic targets and agents.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2018

29435558,Association Between Amyloid and Tau Accumulation in Young Adults With Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease.,"IMPORTANCE: It is critically important to improve our ability to diagnose and track Alzheimer disease (AD) as early as possible. Individuals with autosomal dominant forms of AD can provide clues as to which and when biological changes are reliably present prior to the onset of clinical symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the associations between amyloid and tau deposits in the brains of cognitively unimpaired and impaired carriers of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional imaging study, we leveraged data from a homogeneous autosomal dominant AD kindred, which allowed us to examine measurable tau deposition as a function of individuals' proximity to the expected onset of dementia. Cross-sectional measures of carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET) and flortaucipir F 18 (previously known as AV 1451, T807) PET imaging were assessed in 24 PSEN1 E280A kindred members (age range, 28-55 years), including 12 carriers, 9 of whom were cognitively unimpaired and 3 of whom had mild cognitive impairment, and 12 cognitively unimpaired noncarriers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We compared carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B PET cerebral with cerebellar distribution volume ratios as well as flortaucipir F 18 PET cerebral with cerebellar standardized uptake value ratios in mutation carriers and noncarriers. Spearman correlations characterized the associations between age and mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels or regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio levels in both groups.
RESULTS: Of the 24 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 38.0 (7.4) years, or approximately 6 years younger than the expected onset of clinical symptoms in carriers. Compared with noncarriers, cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers had elevated mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels in their late 20s, and 7 of 9 carriers older than 30 years reached the threshold for amyloidosis (distribution volume ratio level > 1.2). Elevated levels of tau deposition were seen within medial temporal lobe regions in amyloid-positive mutation carriers 6 years before clinical onset of AD in this kindred. Substantial tau deposition in the neocortex was only observed in 1 unimpaired carrier and in those with mild cognitive impairment. β-Amyloid uptake levels were diffusely elevated in unimpaired carriers approximately 15 years prior to expected onset of mild cognitive impairment. In carriers, higher levels of tau deposition were associated with worse performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.60; P = .04; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.54; P = .06) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease Word List Delayed Recall (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.86; P < .001; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.70; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The present findings add to the growing evidence that molecular markers can characterize biological changes associated with AD in individuals who are still cognitively unimpaired. The findings also suggest that tau PET imaging may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish individuals at high risk to develop the clinical symptoms of AD and to track disease progression.",JAMA Neurol,2018
30422173,Association of Apolipoprotein E ε4 With Transactive Response DNA-Binding Protein 43.,"IMPORTANCE: Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is strongly associated with β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and risk of AD, but its association with TDP-43 is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the APOE ε4 allele is a risk factor for TDP-43.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, genetic-histologic study analyzed APOE genotype, TDP-43 status (positive vs negative), Aβ status (positive vs negative), and tau neurofibrillary tangle stage (B0, Braak stage 0; B1, Braak stages I-II; B2, Braak stages III-IV; B3, Braak stage ≥ V). We fit structural equation models to map the association between APOE and TDP-43, Aβ, and tau, accounting for age and hippocampal sclerosis. We identified 751 participants with an AD pathological spectrum diagnosis and completed Aβ, tau, and TDP-43 data who were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry, or the population based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and died between May 12, 1999, and December 31, 2015. However, 13 were excluded from the analyses because of missing APOE data, leaving a total of 738 participants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 was the main outcome of interest. We hypothesized that the APOE ε4 allele would be significantly directly and indirectly associated with TDP-43.
RESULTS: The 751 study participants were older (median age [interquartile range], 87 years [51-105 years]), 395 (54%) were women, and 324 (44%) were APOE ε4 carriers. The patients died between May 12, 1999, and December 31, 2015. Accounting for age, Aβ, and tau, APOE ε4 had a direct association with TDP-43 (estimate [SE], 0.31 (0.11); P = .01). The association was present among individuals with an intermediate to high likelihood of having AD (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2/B3; n = 604 [81.8%]; estimate [SE], 0.51 [0.11]; P < .001), with a similar trend for those with a low likelihood of having AD (B1; n = 134 [18.2%]; estimate [SE], 0.54 [0.32]; P = .10). We also found an indirect association of APOE ε4 with TDP-43 via Aβ and tau (estimate [SE], 0.34 [0.06]; P < .001), which was similar in magnitude to the direct association and an indirect association of APOE ε4 with hippocampal sclerosis via TDP-43 (estimate [SE], 0.65 [0.26]; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study's findings, which mapped a system of risk factors and outcomes, showed that the APOE ε4 allele appears to be a risk factor for TDP-43 independently of Aβ in patients with AD.",JAMA Neurol,2018
30594228,Proteolytic cleavage of Beclin 1 exacerbates neurodegeneration.,"BACKGROUND: Neuronal cell loss contributes to the pathology of acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains crucial to identify molecular mechanisms sensitizing neurons to various insults and cell death. To date, the multifunctional, autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for neuronal integrity in neurodegenerative models associated with protein aggregation. Interestingly, besides its role in cellular homeostasis, Beclin 1 has also been ascribed a role in apoptosis. This makes it critical to elucidate whether Beclin 1 regulates neuronal death and survival across neurodegenerative conditions independent of protein clearance. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a direct functional link between proteolytic cleavage of Beclin 1 and apoptotic neuronal cell loss in two independent models of neurodegeneration in vivo.
METHODS: Proteolytic cleavage of Beclin 1 was characterized in lysates of human AD brain samples. We developed viral tools allowing for the selective neuronal expression of the various Beclin 1 forms, including Beclin 1 cleavage products as well as a cleavage-resistant form. The effect of these Beclin 1 forms on survival and integrity of neurons was examined in models of acute and chronic neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo. Markers of neuronal integrity, neurodegeneration and inflammation were further assessed in a Kainic acid-based mouse model of acute excitotoxic neurodegeneration and in a hAPP-transgenic mouse model of AD following perturbation of Beclin 1 in the susceptible CA1 region of the hippocampus.
RESULTS: We find a significant increase in caspase-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage fragments in brain lysates of human AD patients and mimic this phenotype in vivo using both an excitotoxic and hAPP-transgenic mouse model of neurodegeneration. Surprisingly, overexpression of the C-terminal cleavage-fragment exacerbated neurodegeneration in two distinct models of degeneration. Local inhibition of caspase activity ameliorated neurodegeneration after excitotoxic insult and prevented Beclin 1 cleavage. Furthermore, overexpression of a cleavage-resistant form of Beclin 1 in hippocampal neurons conferred neuroprotection against excitotoxic and Amyloid beta-associated insults in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings indicate that the cleavage state of Beclin 1 determines its functional involvement in both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. Hence, manipulating the cleavage state of Beclin 1 may represent a therapeutic strategy for preventing neuronal cell loss across multiple forms of neurodegeneration.",Mol Neurodegener,2018
30349106,A histone acetylome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease identifies disease-associated H3K27ac differences in the entorhinal cortex.,"We quantified genome-wide patterns of lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in entorhinal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and matched controls using chromatin immunoprecipitation and highly parallel sequencing. We observed widespread acetylomic variation associated with AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) between AD cases and controls. Differentially acetylated peaks were enriched in disease-related biological pathways and included regions annotated to genes involved in the progression of amyloid-β and tau pathology (for example, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT), as well as regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD. Partitioned heritability analysis highlighted a highly significant enrichment of AD risk variants in entorhinal cortex H3K27ac peak regions. AD-associated variable H3K27ac was associated with transcriptional variation at proximal genes including CR1, GPR22, KMO, PIM3, PSEN1, and RGCC. In addition to identifying molecular pathways associated with AD neuropathology, we present a framework for genome-wide studies of histone modifications in complex disease.",Nat Neurosci,2018
30553154,Influence of hypertension on brain amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's disease signature neurodegeneration.,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship of hypertension with beta-amyloid (Aβ) and neurodegeneration biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the modulating effect of apolipoprotein E-ε4 (APOE4). In total, 259 cognitively normal (CN) and 79 AD dementia older adults received clinical assessments including the evaluation for the presence of hypertension, [<sup>11</sup>C]-Pittsburgh-compound-B-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and APOE genotyping. We used a clinical stage-specific approach, separately focusing on CN and AD dementia stages. For the CN group, individuals with hypertension showed reduced AD signature cortical thickness compared with those without hypertension. Subsequent subgroup analyses showed that hypertension was associated with reduced AD signature cortical thickness only in APOE4 noncarriers, whereas hypertension was associated with elevated Aβ deposition in APOE4 carriers. Meanwhile, regardless of APOE4 status, AD dementia patients with hypertension had significantly lower Aβ deposition than those without hypertension. In conclusion, the findings suggest that hypertension contributes to AD primarily through the reduction of brain reserve. In case of APOE4 carriers, however, hypertension seems to additionally facilitate AD process through amyloid-dependent pathway.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
30447418,In vivo visualization of age-related differences in the locus coeruleus.,"The locus coeruleus (LC), the major origin of noradrenergic modulation of the central nervous system, may play an important role in neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The pattern of age-related change of the LC across the life span is unclear. We obtained normalized, mean LC signal intensity values, that is, contrast ratios (CRs), from magnetization transfer-weighted images to investigate the relationship between LC CR and age in cognitively normal healthy adults (N = 605, age range 18-88 years). Study participants were part of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience-an open-access, population-based data set. We found a quadratic relationship between LC CR and age, the peak occurring around 60 years, with no differences between males and females. Subregional analyses revealed that age-related decline in LC CR was confined to the rostral portion of the LC. Older adults showed greater variance in overall LC CR than younger adults, and the functional and clinical implications of these observed age-related differences require further investigation. Visualization of the LC in this study may inform how future scanning parameters can be optimized, and provides insight into how LC integrity changes across the life span.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
30703628,White matter in different regions evolves differently during progression to dementia.,"White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are common in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. Patients with MCI with high WMH volumes are known to have an increased chance of conversion to Alzheimer's disease compared with those without WMHs. In this article, we assess the differences between patients with MCI that remain stable (N = 413) and those that progress to dementia (N = 178) in terms of WMH volume (as a surrogate of amount of tissue damage) and T1-weighted (T1w) image hypointensity (as a surrogate of severity of tissue damage) in periventricular, deep, and juxtacortical brain regions. Together, lesion volume and T1w hypointensity are used as a surrogate of vascular disease burden. Our results show a significantly greater increase of all regional WMH volumes in the MCI population that converts to dementia (p < 0.001). T1w hypointensity for the juxtacortical WMHs was significantly lower in the converter group (p < 0.0001) and was not affected by age. Conversely, T1w hypointensity in other regions showed a significant decrease with age (p < 0.0001). Within the converters, Time2Conversion was associated with both WMH volume and T1w hypointensity (p < 0.0001), and conversion to dementia was significantly associated with decreased intensity (and not volume) of periventricular and juxtacortical WMHs (p < 0.001). These changes differ according to the WM region, suggesting that different mechanisms affect the juxtacortical area in comparison to deep and periventricular regions in the process of conversion to dementia.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
30508732,Administration of the benzodiazepine midazolam increases tau phosphorylation in the mouse brain.,"Preclinical studies have shown that anesthesia might accelerate the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can have an impact on tau pathology, a hallmark of AD. Although benzodiazepines have been suggested to increase the risk of incident dementia, their impact on tau pathology in vivo is unknown. We thus examined the impact of midazolam, a benzodiazepine that is often administered perioperatively as an anxiolytic, on tau hyperphosphorylation in nontransgenic and in hTau mice, the latter a model of AD-like tau pathology. The acute administration of midazolam in C57BL/6 mice was associated with downregulation of protein phosphatase-1 and a significant and persistent increase in brain tau phosphorylation. In hTau mice, tau hyperphosphorylation was also observed; however, midazolam was neither associated with proaggregant changes nor spatial reference memory impairment. In C57BL/6 mice, chronic midazolam administration immediately increased hippocampal tau phosphorylation, and this effect was more pronounced in older mice. Interestingly, in young C57BL/6 mice, chronic midazolam administration induced hippocampal tau hyperphosphorylation, which persisted for 1 week. In hTau mice, chronic midazolam administration increased hippocampal tau phosphorylation and, although this was not associated with proaggregant changes, this correlated with a decreased capacity of tau to bind to preassembled microtubules. These findings suggest that midazolam can induce significant tau hyperphosphorylation in vivo, which persists well beyond recovery from its sedative effects. Moreover, it can disrupt one of tau's critical functions. Hence, future studies should focus on the impact of more prolonged or repeated benzodiazepine exposure on tau pathology and cognitive decline.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
30557769,Impairment in complex activities of daily living is related to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease-specific regions.,"Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is an early clinical feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurobiology underlying IADL disruptions is still unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship between IADL functioning and cortical atrophy across the AD spectrum. We selected 162 memory-clinic subjects with subjective cognitive decline (n = 49), mild cognitive impairment (n = 26) or AD dementia (n = 87), and an available structural MRI acquired at 3.0 Tesla and Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) assessment. We used linear regression correcting for age, sex, education, vascular injuries, and total intracranial volume to investigate the association between gray matter volume and A-IADL-Q score, and voxel-based morphometry to investigate whether any associations were specific for distinct regions. Less gray matter volume was associated with lower A-IADL-Q scores (β = 0.346, 95% CI = [0.185-0.507], p < 0.001), specifically in cortical regions covering the medial temporal lobes, cingulate cortex, and precuneus (all p(familywise error-corrected) < 0.05). Results were similar when repeating the analyses in amyloid-positive subjects (n = 78). Our findings illustrate that the A-IADL-Q detects functional impairment related to AD-specific neurodegeneration.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
30579145,Trajectories of cognitive decline differ in hippocampal sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.,"Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a prevalent cause of dementia in the oldest old but is generally misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to similarities in clinical presentation. To determine if clinical and cognitive features diverge over time, we compared results from longitudinal evaluations of participants in the University of California, San Diego, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center with autopsy-confirmed AD (n = 195), HS (n = 21), or both HS + AD (n = 18). Each group exhibited decline in all cognitive measures, with HS declining at a slower rate than AD on the Mini-Mental State Examination, immediate recall condition of a word-list learning test, and Dementia Rating Scale total and subtest scores (except memory). Five years before the final evaluation, more prominent semantic and visuospatial deficits were apparent in AD participants than in HS participants despite comparable global cognitive impairment. Groups did not differ on any measure of executive function. HS + AD differed from AD only on the Boston Naming Test. Overall, results suggest that HS dementia is associated with cognitive deficits that progress more slowly than, but generally mimic, those observed in AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
29473050,CYP2C19 variant mitigates Alzheimer disease pathophysiology in vivo and postmortem.,"OBJECTIVE: To verify whether CYP polymorphisms are associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology across the spectrum of clinical Alzheimer disease using in vivo and postmortem data from 2 independent cohorts.
METHODS: A candidate-gene approach tested the association between 5 genes (28 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and Aβ load measured in vivo by the global [<sup>18</sup>F]florbetapir PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 338 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. Significant results were then tested using plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ and Aβ/phosphorylated tau (Aβ/p-tau) ratio in the same cohort. The significant association was also generalized to postmortem Aβ load measurement in the Rush Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project cohorts. In addition, global cognition was used as a phenotype in the analysis in both cohorts.
RESULTS: Analysis of Aβ PET identified a variant in the CYP2C19 gene (rs4388808; p = 0.0006), in which carriers of the minor allele (MA) had a lower global SUVR. A voxel-wise analysis revealed that the variant is associated with a lower Aβ load in the frontal, inferior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. MA carriers also had higher CSF Aβ (p = 0.003) and Aβ/p-tau ratio (p = 0.02) but had no association with Aβ plasma levels. In postmortem brains, MA carriers had a lower Aβ load (p = 0.03). Global cognition was higher in MA carriers, which was found to be mediated by Aβ.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings point to an association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and Aβ pathology, suggesting a protective effect of the MA of rs4388808. Despite the several possibilities in which CYP2C19 affects brain Aβ, the biological mechanism by which this genetic variation may act as a protective factor merits further investigation.",Neurol Genet,2018
30217936,An MRI measure of degenerative and cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To develop, replicate, and validate an MRI-based quantitative measure of both cerebrovascular and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD) for clinical and potentially research purposes.
METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional and longitudinal community-based study of Medicare-eligible residents in northern Manhattan followed every 18-24 months (n = 1,175, mean age 78 years). White matter hyperintensities, infarcts, hippocampal volumes, and cortical thicknesses were quantified from MRI and combined to generate an MRI measure associated with episodic memory. The combined MRI measure was replicated and validated using autopsy data, clinical diagnoses, and CSF biomarkers and amyloid PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
RESULTS: The quantitative MRI measure was developed in a group of community participants (n = 690) and replicated in a similar second group (n = 485). Compared with healthy controls, the quantitative MRI measure was lower in patients with mild cognitive impairment and lower still in those with clinically diagnosed AD. The quantitative MRI measure correlated with neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, atrophy, and infarcts at postmortem in an autopsy subset and was also associated with PET amyloid imaging and CSF levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau, and β-amyloid 42. The MRI measure predicted conversion to MCI and clinical AD among healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: We developed, replicated, and validated an MRI measure of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies that are associated with clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis of AD and related to established biomarkers.",Neurology,2018
30359603,The Meningeal Lymphatic System: A New Player in Neurophysiology.,"The nature of fluid dynamics within the brain parenchyma is a focus of intensive research. Of particular relevance is its participation in diseases associated with protein accumulation and aggregation in the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The meningeal lymphatic vessels have recently been recognized as an important player in the complex circulation and exchange of soluble contents between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the interstitial fluid (ISF). In aging mammals, for example, impaired functioning of the meningeal lymphatic vessels can lead to accelerated accumulation of toxic amyloid beta protein in the brain parenchyma, thus aggravating AD-related pathology. Given that meningeal lymphatic vessels are functionally linked to paravascular influx/efflux of the CSF/ISF, and in light of recent findings that certain cytokines, classically perceived as immune molecules, exert neuromodulatory effects, it is reasonable to suggest that the activity of meningeal lymphatics could alter the accessibility of CSF-borne immune neuromodulators to the brain parenchyma, thereby altering their effects on the brain. Accordingly, in this Perspective we propose that the meningeal lymphatic system can be viewed as a novel player in neurophysiology.",Neuron,2018
30298527,Invited Review: From nose to gut - the role of the microbiome in neurological disease.,"Inflammation and neurodegeneration are key features of many chronic neurological diseases, yet the causative mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. There has been mounting interest in the role of the human microbiome in modulating the inflammatory milieu of the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. To date, most research has focussed on a gut-brain axis, with other mucosal surfaces being relatively neglected. We herein take the novel approach of comprehensively reviewing the roles of the microbiome across several key mucosal interfaces - the nose, mouth, lung and gut - in health and in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This review systematically appraises the anatomical and microbiological landscape of each mucosal surface in health and disease before considering relevant mechanisms that may influence the initiation and progression of PD, AD and MS. The cumulative effects of dysbiosis from the nose to the gut may contribute significantly to neurological disease through a wide variety of mechanisms, including direct translocation of bacteria and their products, and modulation of systemic or CNS-specific immunity. This remains an understudied and exciting area for future research and may lead to the development of therapeutic targets for chronic neurological disease.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,2018
30321409,Genome-wide identification of genic and intergenic neuronal DNA regions bound by Tau protein under physiological and stress conditions.,"Tauopathies such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are neurodegenerative disorders for which there is presently no cure. They are named after the abnormal oligomerization/aggregation of the neuronal microtubule-associated Tau protein. Besides its role as a microtubule-associated protein, a DNA-binding capacity and a nuclear localization for Tau protein has been described in neurons. While questioning the potential role of Tau-DNA binding in the development of tauopathies, we have carried out a large-scale analysis of the interaction of Tau protein with the neuronal genome under physiological and heat stress conditions using the ChIP-on-chip technique that combines Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) with DNA microarray (chip). Our findings show that Tau protein specifically interacts with genic and intergenic DNA sequences of primary culture of neurons with a preference for DNA regions positioned beyond the ±5000 bp range from transcription start site. An AG-rich DNA motif was found recurrently present within Tau-interacting regions and 30% of Tau-interacting regions overlapped DNA sequences coding for lncRNAs. Neurological processes affected in AD were enriched among Tau-interacting regions with in vivo gene expression assays being indicative of a transcriptional repressor role for Tau protein, which was exacerbated in neurons displaying nuclear pathological oligomerized forms of Tau protein.",Nucleic Acids Res,2018
28977551,AAgMarker 1.0: a resource of serological autoantigen biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis of various human diseases.,"Autoantibodies are produced to target an individual's own antigens (e.g. proteins). They can trigger autoimmune responses and inflammation, and thus, cause many types of diseases. Many high-throughput autoantibody profiling projects have been reported for unbiased identification of serological autoantigen-based biomarkers. However, a lack of centralized data portal for these published assays has been a major obstacle to further data mining and cross-evaluate the quality of these datasets generated from different diseases. Here, we introduce a user-friendly database, AAgMarker 1.0, which collects many published raw datasets obtained from serum profiling assays on the proteome microarrays, and provides a toolbox for mining these data. The current version of AAgMarker 1.0 contains 854 serum samples, involving 136 092 proteins. A total of 7803 (4470 non-redundant) candidate autoantigen biomarkers were identified and collected for 12 diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Bechet's disease and Parkinson's disease. Seven statistical parameters are introduced to quantitatively assess these biomarkers. Users can retrieve, analyse and compare the datasets through basic search, advanced search and browse. These biomarkers are also downloadable by disease terms. The AAgMarker 1.0 is now freely accessible at http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/AAgMarker/. We believe this database will be a valuable resource for the community of both biomedical and clinical research.",Nucleic Acids Res,2018
30388101,Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha G78R variant alters ligand binding and confers protection to Alzheimer's disease.,"Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha (PILRA) is a cell surface inhibitory receptor that recognizes specific O-glycosylated proteins and is expressed on various innate immune cell types including microglia. We show here that a common missense variant (G78R, rs1859788) of PILRA is the likely causal allele for the confirmed Alzheimer's disease risk locus at 7q21 (rs1476679). The G78R variant alters the interaction of residues essential for sialic acid engagement, resulting in >50% reduced binding for several PILRA ligands including a novel ligand, complement component 4A, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein B. PILRA is an entry receptor for HSV-1 via glycoprotein B, and macrophages derived from R78 homozygous donors showed significantly decreased levels of HSV-1 infection at several multiplicities of infection compared to homozygous G78 macrophages. We propose that PILRA G78R protects individuals from Alzheimer's disease risk via reduced inhibitory signaling in microglia and reduced microglial infection during HSV-1 recurrence.",PLoS Genet,2018
30383807,"The association of multiple anti-hypertensive medication classes with Alzheimer's disease incidence across sex, race, and ethnicity.","BACKGROUND: Antihypertensive treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in AD, and thus RAS-acting AHTs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs)) may offer differential and additional protective benefits against AD compared with other AHTs, in addition to hypertension management.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort design, we examined the medical and pharmacy claims of a 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2007 to 2013, and compared rates of AD diagnosis for 1,343,334 users of six different AHT drug treatments, 65 years of age or older (4,215,338 person-years). We compared AD risk between RAS and non-RAS AHT drug users, and between ACEI users and ARB users, by sex and race/ethnicity. Models adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, underlying health, and comorbidities.
FINDINGS: RAS-acting AHTs were slightly more protective against onset of AD than non-RAS-acting AHTs for males, (male OR = 0.931 (CI: 0.895-0.969)), but not so for females (female OR = 0.985 (CI: 0.963-1.007)). Relative to other AHTs, ARBs were superior to ACEIs for both men (male ARB OR = 0.834 (CI: 0.788-0.884); male ACEI OR = 0.978 (CI: 0.939-1.019)) and women (female ARB OR = 0.941 (CI: 0.913-0.969); female ACEI OR = 1.022 (CI: 0.997-1.048)), but only in white men and white and black women. No association was shown for Hispanic men and women.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension management treatments that include RAS-acting ARBs may, in addition to lowering blood pressure, reduce AD risk, particularly for white and black women and white men. Additional studies and clinical trials that include men and women from different racial and ethnic groups are needed to confirm these findings. Understanding the potentially beneficial effects of certain RAS-acting AHTs in high-risk populations is of great importance.",PLoS One,2018
30395575,Medial septal cholinergic mediation of hippocampal theta rhythm induced by vagal nerve stimulation.,"BACKGROUND: Electrical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been used for years to treat patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. This technique also remains under investigation as a specific treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Recently we discovered that VNS induced hippocampal formation (HPC) type II theta rhythm, which is involved in memory consolidation. In the present study, we have extended our previous observation and addressed the neuronal substrate and pharmacological profile of HPC type II theta rhythm induced by VNS in anesthetized rats.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were implanted with a VNS cuff electrode around the left vagus nerve, a tungsten microelectrode for recording the HPC field activity, and a medial septal (MS) cannula for the injection of a local anesthetic, procaine, and muscarinic agents. A direct, brief effect of VNS on the HPC field potential was evaluated before and after medial-septal drug injection.
RESULTS: Medial septal injection of local anesthetic, procaine, reversibly abolished VNS-induced HPC theta rhythm. With the use of cholinergic muscarinic agonist and antagonists, we demonstrated that medial septal M1 receptors are involved in the mediation of the VNS effect on HPC theta field potential.
CONCLUSION: The MS cholinergic M1 receptor mechanism integrates not only central inputs from the brainstem synchronizing pathway, which underlies the production of HPC type II theta rhythm, but also the input from the vagal afferents in the brain stem.",PLoS One,2018
30517207,Longer TOMM40 poly-T variants associated with higher FDDNP-PET medial temporal tau and amyloid binding.,"BACKGROUND: The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40), which lies in linkage disequilibrium with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). TOMM40 influences AD pathology through mitochondrial neurotoxicity, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the most likely brain region for identifying early manifestations of AD-related morphology changes. While early reports indicated that the longer length poly-T allele of TOMM40 increases risk for AD, these findings have not been consistently replicated in further studies. We examined the effect of TOMM40 and APOE on regional brain positron emission tomography (PET) 2-(1-{6-[(2 [F18]fluoroethyl) (methyl) amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) binding values in MTL.
METHODS: A total of 73 non-demented older adults (42 females; mean age: 62.9(10.9) completed genotyping for both APOE and TOMM40 and received FDDNP-PET scans. For TOMM40, the lengths of the poly-T sequence were classified as short (14-20 repeats; S), long (21-29 repeats, L) or very long (>29 repeats, VL). Using general linear models, we examined medial temporal lobe FDDNP binding and cognitive functioning between TOMM40 and APOE-4 groups, with age, sex, and education as covariates.
RESULTS: Data from 30 individuals with APOE-4 and L TOMM40 poly-T length, 11 non E4 TOMM40 S/S, 14 non E4 TOMM40 S/VL and 13 non E4 TOMM40 VL/VL were analyzed. Medial temporal FDDNP binding differed significantly between TOMM40/APOE groups (F(3,62) = 3.3,p = .03). Participants with TOMM40 S/S exhibited significantly lower binding compared to TOMM40 S/VL and APOE-4 carriers. We did not find a significant relationship between TOMM40 poly-T lengths/APOE risk groups and cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to demonstrate a significant association between longer TOMM40 poly-T lengths and higher medial temporal plaque and tangle burden in non-demented older adults. Identifying biomarkers that are risk factors for AD will enhance our ability to identify subjects likely to benefit from novel AD treatments.",PLoS One,2018
29212848,Association of complement receptor 1 gene polymorphisms with cognitive function.,"Previous evidence suggest involvement of the complement receptor 1 (CR1) in development of Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the association of CR1 gene polymorphisms with cognitive function in older subjects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region on chromosome 1 ( n = 73) were assessed in 5,244 participants in the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (51.9% female, mean age 75.3 yr). Linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, country, and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cognitive function. All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. Eighteen were independent, according to a relatively stringent R<sup>2</sup> threshold of &gt;0.8 with LDlink. Twelve of the 18 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with a decline in cognitive function (all P &lt; 0.05). These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated not only with Alzheimer's disease, but also with general cognitive function during late life.",Physiol Genomics,2018
30254165,Blood-derived plasminogen drives brain inflammation and plaque deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Two of the most predominant features of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and inflammation. The mechanism behind these pathologies remains unknown, but there is evidence to suggest that inflammation may predate the deposition of Aβ. Furthermore, immune activation is increasingly being recognized as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of the disease, and disorders involving systemic inflammation, such as infection, aging, obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and depression are risk factors for the development of AD. Plasminogen (PLG) is primarily a blood protein synthesized in the liver, which when cleaved into its active form, plasmin (PL), plays roles in fibrinolysis, wound healing, cell signaling, and inflammatory regulation. Here we show that PL in the blood is a regulator of brain inflammatory action and AD pathology. Depletion of PLG in the plasma of an AD mouse model through antisense oligonucleotide technology dramatically improved AD pathology and decreased glial cell activation in the brain, whereas an increase in PL activity through α-2-antiplasmin (A2AP) antisense oligonucleotide treatment exacerbated the brain's immune response and plaque deposition. These studies suggest a crucial role for peripheral PL in mediating neuroimmune cell activation and AD progression and could provide a link to systemic inflammatory risk factors that are known to be associated with AD development.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2018
29632177,β-Amyloid accumulation in the human brain after one night of sleep deprivation.,"The effects of acute sleep deprivation on β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance in the human brain have not been documented. Here we used PET and <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben to measure brain Aβ burden (ABB) in 20 healthy controls tested after a night of rested sleep (baseline) and after a night of sleep deprivation. We show that one night of sleep deprivation, relative to baseline, resulted in a significant increase in Aβ burden in the right hippocampus and thalamus. These increases were associated with mood worsening following sleep deprivation, but were not related to the genetic risk (APOE genotype) for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, baseline ABB in a range of subcortical regions and the precuneus was inversely associated with reported night sleep hours. APOE genotyping was also linked to subcortical ABB, suggesting that different Alzheimer's disease risk factors might independently affect ABB in nearby brain regions. In summary, our findings show adverse effects of one-night sleep deprivation on brain ABB and expand on prior findings of higher Aβ accumulation with chronic less sleep.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2018
30232263,Differential effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial injury response and tauopathy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, as well as microgliosis. Hemizygous missense variants in Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with elevated risk for developing late-onset AD. These variants are hypothesized to result in loss of function, mimicking TREM2 haploinsufficiency. However, the consequences of TREM2 haploinsufficiency on tau pathology and microglial function remain unknown. We report the effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial function and tau-associated deficits. In vivo imaging revealed that microglia from aged TREM2-haploinsufficient mice show a greater impairment in their injury response compared with microglia from aged TREM2-KO mice. In transgenic mice expressing mutant human tau, TREM2 haploinsufficiency, but not complete loss of TREM2, increased tau pathology. In addition, whereas complete TREM2 deficiency protected against tau-mediated microglial activation and atrophy, TREM2 haploinsufficiency elevated expression of proinflammatory markers and exacerbated atrophy at a late stage of disease. The differential effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial function and tau pathology provide important insights into the critical role of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2018
30560948,Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in the absence of Presenilin 1 and Presenilin 2.,"Mutations in the presenilin genes (PS1 and PS2) are a major cause of familial-Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Presenilins regulate neurogenesis in the developing brain, with loss of PS1 inducing aberrant premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and additional loss of PS2 exacerbating this effect. It is unclear, however, whether presenilins are involved in adult neurogenesis, a process that may be impaired in Alzheimer's disease within the hippocampus. To investigate the requirement of presenilins in adult-generated dentate granule neurons, we examined adult neurogenesis in the PS2-/- adult brain and then employ a retroviral approach to ablate PS1 selectively in dividing progenitor cells of the PS2-/- adult brain. Surprisingly, the in vivo ablation of both presenilins resulted in no defects in the survival and differentiation of adult-generated neurons. There was also no change in the morphology or functional properties of the retroviral-labeled presenilin-null cells, as assessed by dendritic morphology and whole-cell electrophysiology analyses. Furthermore, while FACS analysis showed that stem and progenitor cells express presenilins, inactivation of presenilins from these cells, using a NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup> inducible genetic approach, demonstrated no changes in the proliferation, survival, or differentiation of adult-generated cells. Therefore, unlike their significant role in neurogenesis during embryonic development, presenilins are not required for cell-intrinsic regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",Sci Rep,2018
30571418,Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background and Purpose- Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are safer, at least equally efficacious, and cost-effective compared to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) but they remain underused, particularly in demented patients. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of DOACs compared with warfarin in patients with AF and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods- We constructed a microsimulation model to estimate the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy (adjusted-dose warfarin and various DOACs) in 70-year-old patients with AF and AD from a US societal perspective. We stratified patient cohorts based on stage of AD and care setting. Model parameters were estimated from secondary sources. Health benefits were measured in the number of acute health events, life-years, and QALYs gained. We classified alternatives as cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained. Results- For patients with AF and AD, compared with warfarin, DOACs increase costs but also increase QALYs by reducing the risk of stroke. For mild-AD patients living in the community, edoxaban increased lifetime costs by $6603 and increased QALYs by 0.076 compared to warfarin, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $86 882/QALY gained. Even though DOACs increased QALYs compared with warfarin for all patient groups (ranging from 0.019 to 0.085 additional QALYs), no DOAC treatment alternative had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$150 000/QALY gained for patients with moderate to severe AD. For patients living in a long-term care facility with mild AD, the DOAC with the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (rivaroxaban) costs $150 169 per QALY gained; for patients with more severe AD, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were higher. Conclusions- For patients with AF and mild AD living in the community, edoxaban is cost-effective compared with warfarin. Even though patients with moderate and severe AD living in the community and patients with any stage of AD living in a long-term care setting may obtain positive clinical benefits from anticoagulation treatment, DOACs are not cost-effective compared with warfarin for these populations. Compared to aspirin, no oral anticoagulation (warfarin or any DOAC) is cost effective in patients with AF and AD.",Stroke,2018
31822997,Human subiculo-fornico-mamillary system in Alzheimer's disease: Tau seeding by the pillar of the fornix.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), Tau and Aβ aggregates involve sequentially connected regions, sometimes distantly separated. These alterations were studied in the pillar of the fornix (PoF), an axonal tract, to analyse the role of axons in their propagation. The PoF axons mainly originate from the subicular neurons and project to the mamillary body. Forty-seven post-mortem cases at various Braak stages (Tau) and Thal phases (Aβ) were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of the lesions showed that the subiculum was affected before the mamillary body, but neither Tau aggregation nor Aβ deposition was consistently first. The subiculum and the mamillary body contained Gallyas positive neurofibrillary tangles, immunolabelled by AT8, TG3, PHF1, Alz50 and C3 Tau antibodies. In the PoF, only thin and fragmented threads were observed, exclusively in the cases with neurofibrillary tangles in the subiculum. The threads were made of Gallyas negative, AT8 and TG3 positive Tau. They were intra-axonal and devoid of paired helical filaments at electron microscopy. We tested PoF homogenates containing Tau AT8 positive axons in a Tau P301S biosensor HEK cell line and found a seeding activity. There was no Aβ immunoreactivity detected in the PoF. We could follow microcryodissected AT8 positive axons entering the mamillary body; contacts between Tau positive endings and Aβ positive diffuse or focal deposits were observed in CLARITY-cleared mamillary body. In conclusion, we show that non-fibrillary, hyperphosphorylated Tau is transported by the axons of the PoF from the subiculum to the mamillary body and has a seeding activity. Either Tau aggregation or Aβ accumulation may occur first in this system: this inconstant order is incompatible with a cause-and-effects relationship. However, both pathologies were correlated and intimately associated, indicating an interaction of the two processes, once initiated.",Acta Neuropathol,2019
31800167,Inhibition of REV-ERBs stimulates microglial amyloid-beta clearance and reduces amyloid plaque deposition in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"A promising new therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the circadian system. Although patients with AD are known to have abnormal circadian rhythms and suffer sleep disturbances, the role of the molecular clock in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology is still poorly understood. Here, we explored how the circadian repressors REV-ERBα and β affected Aβ clearance in mouse microglia. We discovered that, at Circadian time 4 (CT4), microglia expressed higher levels of the master clock protein BMAL1 and more rapidly phagocytosed fibrillary Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (fAβ<sub>1-42</sub> ) than at CT12. BMAL1 directly drives transcription of REV-ERB proteins, which are implicated in microglial activation. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBs with the small molecule antagonist SR8278 or genetic knockdown of REV-ERBs-accelerated microglial uptake of fAβ<sub>1-42</sub> and increased transcription of BMAL1. SR8278 also promoted microglia polarization toward a phagocytic M2-like phenotype with increased P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor expression. Finally, constitutive deletion of Rev-erbα in the 5XFAD model of AD decreased amyloid plaque number and size and prevented plaque-associated increases in disease-associated microglia markers including TREM2, CD45, and Clec7a. Altogether, our work suggests a novel strategy for controlling Aβ clearance and neuroinflammation by targeting REV-ERBs and provides new insights into the role of REV-ERBs in AD.",Aging Cell,2019
31587995,"Escitalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (S-CitAD): Methods and design of an investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial.","INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disabling, common cause of dementia, and agitation is one of the most common and distressing symptoms for patients with AD. Escitalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (S-CitAD) tests a novel, clinically derived therapeutic approach to treat agitation in patients with AD.
METHODS: S-CitAD is a NIH-funded, investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Participants receive a structured psychosocial intervention (PSI) as standard of care. Participants without sufficient response to PSI are randomized to receive 15 mg escitalopram/day or a matching placebo in addition to PSI. Primary outcome is the Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (mADCS-CGIC).
DISCUSSION: S-CitAD will provide information about a practical, immediately available approach to treating agitation in patients with AD. S-CitAD may become a model of how to evaluate and predict treatment response in patients with AD and agitation as a neuropsychiatric symptom (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03108846).",Alzheimers Dement,2019
31495605,MCI-to-normal reversion using neuropsychological criteria in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.,"INTRODUCTION: The low mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to cognitively normal (CN) reversion rate in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2-3%) suggests the need to examine reversion by other means. We applied comprehensive neuropsychological criteria (NP criteria) to determine the resulting MCI to CN reversion rate.
METHODS: Participants with CN (n = 641) or MCI (n = 569) were classified at baseline and year 1 using NP criteria. Demographic, neuropsychological, and Alzheimer's disease biomarker variables as well as progression to dementia were examined across stable CN, reversion, and stable MCI groups.
RESULTS: NP criteria produced a one-year reversion rate of 15.8%. Reverters had demographics, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and risk-of-progression most similar to the stable CN group and showed the most improvement on neuropsychological measures from baseline to year 1.
DISCUSSION: NP criteria produced a reversion rate that is consistent with, albeit modestly improved from, reversion rates in meta-analyses. Reverters' biomarker profiles and progression rates suggest that NP criteria accurately tracked with underlying pathophysiologic status.",Alzheimers Dement,2019
31753701,Prevalence and correlates of mild cognitive impairment among diverse Hispanics/Latinos: Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging results.,"INTRODUCTION: We estimated the prevalence and correlates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among middle-aged and older diverse Hispanics/Latinos.
METHODS: Middle-aged and older diverse Hispanics/Latinos enrolled (n = 6377; 50-86 years) in this multisite prospective cohort study were evaluated for MCI using the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS: The overall MCI prevalence was 9.8%, which varied between Hispanic/Latino groups. Older age, high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and elevated depressive symptoms were significant correlates of MCI prevalence. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE) and APOE2 were not significantly associated with MCI.
DISCUSSION: MCI prevalence varied among Hispanic/Latino backgrounds, but not as widely as reported in the previous studies. CVD risk and depressive symptoms were associated with increased MCI, whereas APOE4 was not, suggesting alternative etiologies for MCI among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. Our findings suggest that mitigating CVD risk factors may offer important pathways to understanding and reducing MCI and possibly dementia among diverse Hispanics/Latinos.",Alzheimers Dement,2019
31677936,Individualized clinical management of patients at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Multidomain intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk reduction is an emerging therapeutic paradigm.
METHODS: Patients were prescribed individually tailored interventions (education/pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic) and rated on compliance. Normal cognition/subjective cognitive decline/preclinical AD was classified as Prevention. Mild cognitive impairment due to AD/mild-AD was classified as Early Treatment. Change from baseline to 18 months on the modified Alzheimer's Prevention Cognitive Composite (primary outcome) was compared against matched historical control cohorts. Cognitive aging composite (CogAging), AD/cardiovascular risk scales, and serum biomarkers were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four were assigned interventions (age 25-86). Higher-compliance Prevention improved more than both historical cohorts (P = .0012, P < .0001). Lower-compliance Prevention also improved more than both historical cohorts (P = .0088, P < .0055). Higher-compliance Early Treatment improved more than lower compliance (P = .0007). Higher-compliance Early Treatment improved more than historical cohorts (P < .0001, P = .0428). Lower-compliance Early Treatment did not differ (P = .9820, P = .1115). Similar effects occurred for CogAging. AD/cardiovascular risk scales and serum biomarkers improved.

31601516,Association between enrollment factors and incident cognitive impairment in Blacks and Whites: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Center.,"INTRODUCTION: We examined the influence of enrollment factors demonstrated to differ by race on incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia using Alzheimer's Disease Center data.
METHODS: Differences in rates of incident impairment between non-Latino Whites and Blacks (n = 12,242) were examined with age-at-progression survival models. Models included race, sex, education, source of recruitment, health factors, and family history of dementia.
RESULTS: No significant race differences in progression were observed in cognitively unimpaired participants. In those with mild cognitive impairment at baseline, Whites evidenced greater risk for progression than Blacks. Enrollment factors, for example, referral source, were significantly related to progression.
DISCUSSION: The finding that Blacks demonstrated lower rate of progression than Whites is contrary to the extant literature. Nested-regression analyses suggested that selection-related factors, differing by race, may account for these findings and influence our ability to accurately estimate risk for progression. It is potentially problematic to make racial comparisons using Alzheimer's Disease Center data sets.",Alzheimers Dement,2019
31921965,Comparison of cholinesterase inhibitor safety in real-world practice.,"INTRODUCTION: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are widely used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Clinical trials have focused on placebo comparisons, inadequately addressing within-class comparative safety.
METHODS: New users of ChEIs in British Columbia were categorized into five study cohorts: low-dose donepezil, high-dose donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine patch, and oral rivastigmine. Comparative safety of ChEIs assessed hazard ratios using propensity score adjusted Cox regression.
RESULTS: Compared with low-dose donepezil, galantamine use was associated with a lower risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.60-1.18), cardiovascular serious adverse events (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.98), and entry into a residential care facility (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.89).
DISCUSSION: Given the absence of randomized trial data showing clinically meaningful benefit of ChEI therapy in Alzheimer's disease, our study suggests preferential use of galantamine may at least be associated with fewer adverse events than treatment with donepezil or rivastigmine.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2019
31585107,A Rare Variant Nonparametric Linkage Method for Nuclear and Extended Pedigrees with Application to Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease via WGS Data.,"To analyze family-based whole-genome sequence (WGS) data for complex traits, we developed a rare variant (RV) non-parametric linkage (NPL) analysis method, which has advantages over association methods. The RV-NPL differs from the NPL in that RVs are analyzed, and allele sharing among affected relative-pairs is estimated only for minor alleles. Analyzing families can increase power because causal variants with familial aggregation usually have larger effect sizes than those underlying sporadic diseases. Differing from association analysis, for NPL only affected individuals are analyzed, which can increase power, since unaffected family members can be susceptibility variant carriers. RV-NPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, inclusion of nonpathogenic variants, as well as allelic and locus heterogeneity and can readily be applied outside of coding regions. In contrast to analyzing common variants using NPL, where loci localize to large genomic regions (e.g., >50 Mb), mapped regions are well defined for RV-NPL. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that RV-NPL is substantially more powerful than applying traditional NPL methods to analyze RVs. The RV-NPL was applied to analyze 107 late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) pedigrees of Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry with WGS data, and statistically significant linkage (LOD ≥ 3.8) was found with RVs in PSMF1 and PTPN21 which have been shown to be involved in LOAD etiology. Additionally, nominally significant linkage was observed with RVs in ABCA7, ACE, EPHA1, and SORL1, genes that were previously reported to be associated with LOAD. RV-NPL is an ideal method to elucidate the genetic etiology of complex familial diseases.",Am J Hum Genet,2019
31874606,Mild cognitive impairment understanding: an empirical study by data-driven approach.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline has emerged as a significant threat to both public health and personal welfare, and mild cognitive decline/impairment (MCI) can further develop into Dementia/Alzheimer's disease. While treatment of Dementia/Alzheimer's disease can be expensive and ineffective sometimes, the prevention of MCI by identifying modifiable risk factors is a complementary and effective strategy.
RESULTS: In this study, based on the data collected by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the nationwide telephone survey, we apply a data-driven approach to re-exam the previously founded risk factors and discover new risk factors. We found that depression, physical health, cigarette usage, education level, and sleep time play an important role in cognitive decline, which is consistent with the previous discovery. Besides that, the first time, we point out that other factors such as arthritis, pulmonary disease, stroke, asthma, marital status also contribute to MCI risk, which is less exploited previously. We also incorporate some machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh the importance of various factors contributed to MCI and predicted cognitive declined.
CONCLUSION: By incorporating the data-driven approach, we can determine that risk factors significantly correlated with diseases. These correlations could also be expanded to another medical diagnosis besides MCI.",BMC Bioinformatics,2019
30923806,rMTA: robust metabolic transformation analysis.,"MOTIVATION: The development of computational tools exploiting -omics data and high-quality genome-scale metabolic networks for the identification of novel drug targets is a relevant topic in Systems Medicine. Metabolic Transformation Algorithm (MTA) is one of these tools, which aims to identify targets that transform a disease metabolic state back into a healthy state, with potential application in any disease where a clear metabolic alteration is observed.
RESULTS: Here, we present a robust extension to MTA (rMTA), which additionally incorporates a worst-case scenario analysis and minimization of metabolic adjustment to evaluate the beneficial effect of gene knockouts.

31116390,deepDR: a network-based deep learning approach to in silico drug repositioning.,"MOTIVATION: Traditional drug discovery and development are often time-consuming and high risk. Repurposing/repositioning of approved drugs offers a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach toward rapid development of efficacious treatments. The emergence of large-scale, heterogeneous biological networks has offered unprecedented opportunities for developing in silico drug repositioning approaches. However, capturing highly non-linear, heterogeneous network structures by most existing approaches for drug repositioning has been challenging.
RESULTS: In this study, we developed a network-based deep-learning approach, termed deepDR, for in silico drug repurposing by integrating 10 networks: one drug-disease, one drug-side-effect, one drug-target and seven drug-drug networks. Specifically, deepDR learns high-level features of drugs from the heterogeneous networks by a multi-modal deep autoencoder. Then the learned low-dimensional representation of drugs together with clinically reported drug-disease pairs are encoded and decoded collectively via a variational autoencoder to infer candidates for approved drugs for which they were not originally approved. We found that deepDR revealed high performance [the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.908], outperforming conventional network-based or machine learning-based approaches. Importantly, deepDR-predicted drug-disease associations were validated by the ClinicalTrials.gov database (AUROC = 0.826) and we showcased several novel deepDR-predicted approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. risperidone and aripiprazole) and Parkinson's disease (e.g. methylphenidate and pergolide).

31501889,The bivariate distribution of amyloid-β and tau: relationship with established neurocognitive clinical syndromes.,"Large phenotypically diverse research cohorts with both amyloid and tau PET have only recently come into existence. Our objective was to determine relationships between the bivariate distribution of amyloid-β and tau on PET and established clinical syndromes that are relevant to cognitive ageing and dementia. All individuals in this study were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study of cognitive ageing, or the Mayo Alzheimer Disease Research Center, a longitudinal study of individuals recruited from clinical practice. We studied 1343 participants who had amyloid PET and tau PET from 2 April 2015 to 3 May 2019, and met criteria for membership in one of five clinical diagnostic groups: cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, probable dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer clinical syndrome. We examined these clinical groups in relation to the bivariate distribution of amyloid and tau PET values. Individuals were grouped into amyloid (A)/tau (T) quadrants based on previously established abnormality cut points of standardized uptake value ratio 1.48 (A) and 1.33 (T). Individual participants largely fell into one of three amyloid/tau quadrants: low amyloid and low tau (A-T-), high amyloid and low tau (A+T-), or high amyloid and high tau (A+T+). Seventy per cent of cognitively unimpaired and 74% of FTD participants fell into the A-T- quadrant. Participants with mild cognitive impairment spanned the A-T- (42%), A+T- (28%), and A+T+ (27%) quadrants. Probable dementia with Lewy body participants spanned the A-T- (38%) and A+T- (44%) quadrants. Most (89%) participants with Alzheimer clinical syndrome fell into the A+T+ quadrant. These data support several conclusions. First, among 1343 participants, abnormal tau PET rarely occurred in the absence of abnormal amyloid PET, but the reverse was common. Thus, with rare exceptions, amyloidosis appears to be required for high levels of 3R/4R tau deposition. Second, abnormal amyloid PET is compatible with normal cognition but highly abnormal tau PET is not. These two conclusions support a dynamic biomarker model in which Alzheimer's disease is characterized first by the appearance of amyloidosis and later by tauopathy, with tauopathy being the proteinopathy associated with clinical symptoms. Third, bivariate amyloid and tau PET relationships differed across clinical groups and thus have a role for clarifying the aetiologies underlying neurocognitive clinical syndromes.",Brain,2019
31504240,CSF1R inhibitor JNJ-40346527 attenuates microglial proliferation and neurodegeneration in P301S mice.,"Neuroinflammation and microglial activation are significant processes in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Recent genome-wide association studies have highlighted multiple immune-related genes in association with Alzheimer's disease, and experimental data have demonstrated microglial proliferation as a significant component of the neuropathology. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the selective CSF1R inhibitor JNJ-40346527 (JNJ-527) in the P301S mouse tauopathy model. We first demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of JNJ-527 on microglia in the ME7 prion model, and its impact on the inflammatory profile, and provided potential CNS biomarkers for clinical investigation with the compound, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and efficacy assessment by TSPO autoradiography and CSF proteomics. Then, we showed for the first time that blockade of microglial proliferation and modification of microglial phenotype leads to an attenuation of tau-induced neurodegeneration and results in functional improvement in P301S mice. Overall, this work strongly supports the potential for inhibition of CSF1R as a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.",Brain,2019
31564046,"Observational and genetic studies of short telomeres and Alzheimer's disease in 67,000 and 152,000 individuals: a Mendelian randomization study.","Short telomeres might lead to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, but observational analyses have been inconclusive and potentially confounded by the strong association of both telomere length and risk of Alzheimer's disease with age and adverse lifestyle. To circumvent this, analyses including single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with telomere length used in an instrumental variable analysis produces risk estimates likely free of distortions from reverse causation and of most confounding. We tested the hypothesis that short telomeres are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, observationally and causal, genetically. Telomere length was measured in 66,567 individuals, and genotyped for rs2487999 in OBFC1, rs7726159 in TERT, and rs1317082 in TERC causing lifelong telomere shortening in 98,146 individuals from two Copenhagen studies. Genetic data on 54,162 individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project were also included. Observationally, multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio for Alzheimer's disease was 1.02 (95% CI 1.00-1.03) per 200 base pair shorter telomeres. Telomere length was 335 base pairs shorter in individuals with 6 versus 0-1 alleles (p = 5 × 10<sup>-105</sup>). Genetically, odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease was 1.08 (1.01-1.16) per 200 base pairs shorter telomeres. Similar results were found in strata of age and comorbidities. In comparative analyses, genetically predicted shorter telomeres were associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, and with decreased risks of lung cancer and melanoma as previously reported. Short telomeres were associated observationally and causal, genetically with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Telomere biology is therefore a potential pathway involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",Eur J Epidemiol,2019
31654039,Longitudinal changes in the frequency of mosaic chromosome Y loss in peripheral blood cells of aging men varies profoundly between individuals.,"Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is the most common somatic genetic aberration and is associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality, various forms of cancer and Alzheimer's disease, as well as other common human diseases. By tracking LOY frequencies in subjects from which blood samples have been serially collected up to five times during up to 22 years, we observed a pronounced intra-individual variation of changes in the frequency of LOY within individual men over time. We observed that in some individuals the frequency of LOY in blood clearly progressed over time and that in other men, the frequency was constant or showed other types of longitudinal development. The predominant method used for estimating LOY is calculation of the median Log R Ratio of probes located in the male specific part of chromosome Y (mLRRY) from intensity data generated by SNP-arrays, which is difficult to interpret due to its logarithmic and inversed scale. We present here a formula to transform mLRRY-values to percentage of LOY that is a more comprehensible unit. The formula was derived using measurements of LOY from matched samples analysed using SNP-array, whole genome sequencing and a new AMELX/AMELY-based assay for droplet digital PCR. The methods described could be applied for analyses of the vast amount of SNP-array data already generated in the scientific community, allowing further discoveries of LOY associated diseases and outcomes.",Eur J Hum Genet,2019
31788001,Chromosome Instability and Mosaic Aneuploidy in Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"Evidence from multiple laboratories has accumulated to show that mosaic neuronal aneuploidy and consequent apoptosis characterizes and may underlie neuronal loss in many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Seckel syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Niemann-Pick type C, and Down syndrome, have been shown to also exhibit mosaic aneuploidy in neurons in the brain and in other cells throughout the body. Together, these results indicate that both neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders with apparently different pathogenic causes share a cell cycle defect that leads to mosaic aneuploidy in many cell types. When such mosaic aneuploidy arises in neurons in the brain, it promotes apoptosis and may at least partly underlie the cognitive deficits that characterize the neurological symptoms of these disorders. These findings have implications for both diagnosis and treatment/prevention.",Front Genet,2019
31827492,Characterization of Blood Surrogate Immune-Methylation Biomarkers for Immune Cell Infiltration in Chronic Inflammaging Disorders.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherosclerosis are both chronic age- and inflammation-dependent diseases. In addition, atherosclerosis is frequently observed in AD patients indicating common involvement of vascular components in both disease etiologies. Recently, epigenome-wide association studies have identified epigenetic alterations, and in particularly DNA methylation changes for both disorders. We hypothesized the existence of a common DNA methylation profile in atherosclerosis and AD which may be valuable as a blood-based DNA methylation inflammaging biomarker. Using publicly available 450k Illumina methylation datasets, we identified a co-methylation network associated with both atherosclerosis and AD in whole blood samples. This methylation profile appeared to indicate shifts in blood immune cell type distribution. Remarkably, similar methylation changes were also detected in disease tissues, including AD brain tissues, atherosclerotic plaques, and tumors and were found to correlate with immune cell infiltration. In addition, this immune-related methylation profile could also be detected in other inflammaging diseases, including Parkinson's disease and obesity, but not in multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and osteoporosis. In conclusion, we identified a blood-based immune-related DNA methylation signature in multiple inflammaging diseases associated with changes in blood immune cell counts and predictive for immune cell infiltration in diseased tissues. In addition to epigenetic clock measurements, this immune-methylation signature may become a valuable blood-based biomarker to prevent chronic inflammatory disease development or monitor lifestyle intervention strategies which promote healthy aging.",Front Genet,2019
31921305,A Rat Model of Human Behavior Provides Evidence of Natural Selection Against Underexpression of Aggressiveness-Related Genes in Humans.,"Aggressiveness is a hereditary behavioral pattern that forms a social hierarchy and affects the individual social rank and accordingly quality and duration of life. Thus, genome-wide studies of human aggressiveness are important. Nonetheless, the aggressiveness-related genome-wide studies have been conducted on animals rather than humans. Recently, in our genome-wide study, we uncovered natural selection against underexpression of human aggressiveness-related genes and proved it using F1 hybrid mice. Simultaneously, this natural selection equally supports two opposing traits in humans (dominance and subordination) as if self-domestication could have happened with its disruptive natural selection. Because there is still not enough scientific evidence that this could happen, here, we verified this natural selection pattern using quantitative PCR and two outbred rat lines (70 generations of artificial selection for aggressiveness or tameness, hereinafter: domestication). We chose seven genes-Cacna2d3, Gad2, Gria2, Mapk1, Nos1, Pomc, and Syn1-over- or underexpression of which corresponds to aggressive or domesticated behavior (in humans or mice) that has the same direction as natural selection. Comparing aggressive male rats with domesticated ones, we found that these genes are overexpressed statistically significantly in the hypothalamus (as a universal behavior regulator), not in the periaqueductal gray, where there was no aggressiveness-related expression of the genes in males. Database STRING showed statistically significant associations of the human genes homologous to these rat genes with long-term depression, circadian entrainment, Alzheimer's disease, and the central nervous system disorders during chronic IL-6 overexpression. This finding more likely supports positive perspectives of further studies on self-domestication syndromes.",Front Genet,2019
30787942,Identification of Pre-symptomatic Gene Signatures That Predict Resilience to Cognitive Decline in the Genetically Diverse AD-BXD Model.,"Across the population, individuals exhibit a wide variation of susceptibility or resilience to developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying specific factors that promote resilience would provide insight into disease mechanisms and nominate potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we use transcriptome profiling to identify gene networks present in the pre-symptomatic AD mouse brain relating to neuroinflammation, brain vasculature, extracellular matrix organization, and synaptic signaling that predict cognitive performance at an advanced age. We highlight putative drivers of these observed relationships, including Itgb2, Fcgr2b, Slc6a14, and Gper1, which represent prime targets through which to promote resilience prior to overt symptom onset. In addition, we identify a genomic region on chromosome 2 containing variants that directly modulate resilience network expression. Overall, work here highlights new potential drivers of resilience to AD and contributes significantly to our understanding of early, potentially causal, disease mechanisms.",Front Genet,2019
30833961,"Dynamic DNA Methylation During Aging: A ""Prophet"" of Age-Related Outcomes.","The biological markers of aging used to predict physical health status in older people are of great interest. Telomere shortening, which occurs during the process of cell replication, was initially considered a promising biomarker for the prediction of age and age-related outcomes (e.g., diseases, longevity). However, the high instability in detection and low correlation with age-related outcomes limit the extension of telomere length to the field of prediction. Currently, a growing number of studies have shown that dynamic DNA methylation throughout human lifetime exhibits strong correlation with age and age-related outcomes. Indeed, many researchers have built age prediction models with high accuracy based on age-dependent methylation changes in certain CpG loci. For now, DNA methylation based on epigenetic clocks, namely epigenetic or DNA methylation age, serves as a new standard to track chronological age and predict biological age. Measures of age acceleration (Δage, DNA methylation age - chronological age) have been developed to assess the health status of a person. In addition, there is evidence that an accelerated epigenetic age exists in patients with certain age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the dynamic signatures of DNA methylation during aging and emphasize its practical utility in the prediction of various age-related outcomes.",Front Genet,2019
31920936,Therapeutic Applications of Cysteamine and Cystamine in Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Diseases.,"Current medications for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Schizophrenia mainly target disease symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics that can delay, halt or reverse disease progression. AD, HD, PD, and schizophrenia are characterized by elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress, which play a central role in pathogenesis. Clinical trials utilizing antioxidants to counter disease progression have largely been unsuccessful. Most antioxidants are relatively non-specific and do not adequately target neuroprotective pathways. Accordingly, a search for agents that restore redox balance as well as halt or reverse neuronal loss is underway. The small molecules, cysteamine, the decarboxylated derivative of the amino acid cysteine, and cystamine, the oxidized form of cysteamine, respectively, mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation and upregulate neuroprotective pathways involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Cysteamine can traverse the blood brain barrier, a desirable characteristic of drugs targeting neurodegeneration. This review addresses recent developments in the use of these aminothiols to counter neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric deficits.",Front Neurol,2019
32009891,The Acute Effects of Amyloid-Beta<sub>1-42</sub> on Glutamatergic Receptor and Transporter Expression in the Mouse Hippocampus.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading type of dementia worldwide. Despite an increasing burden of disease due to a rapidly aging population, there is still a lack of complete understanding of the precise pathological mechanisms which drive its progression. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an essential role in the normal function and excitability of neuronal networks. While previous studies have shown alterations in the function of the glutamatergic system in AD, the underlying etiology of beta amyloid (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) induced changes has not been explored. Here we have investigated the acute effects of stereotaxic hippocampal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> injection on specific glutamatergic receptors and transporters in the mouse hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy 3 days after Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> injection in aged male C57BL/6 mice, before the onset of neuronal cell death. We show that acute injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is sufficient to induce cognitive deficits 3 days post-injection. We also report no significant changes in glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, VGluT1, and VGluT2 in response to acute injection of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> when compared with the ACSF-vehicle injected mice. However, we observed increased expression in the DG hilus and ventral stratum (str.) granulosum, CA3 str. radiatum and str. oriens, and CA1 str. radiatum of the GluN1 subunit, and increased expression within the CA3 str. radiatum and decreased expression within the DG str. granulosum of the GluN2A subunit in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> injected mice compared to NC, and a similar trend observed when compared to ACSF-injected mice. We also observed alterations in expression patterns of glutamatergic receptor subunits and transporters within specific layers of hippocampal subregions in response to a microinjection stimulus. These findings indicate that the pathological alterations in the glutamatergic system observed in AD are likely to be partially a result of both acute and chronic exposure to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and implies a much more complex circuit mechanism associated with glutamatergic dysfunction than simply glutamate-mediated excitotoxic neuronal death.",Front Neurosci,2019
31821608,Some statistical consideration in transcriptome-wide association studies.,"The methodology of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has become popular in integrating a reference expression quantitative trait (eQTL) data set with an independent main GWAS data set to identify (putatively) causal genes, shedding mechanistic insights to biological pathways from genetic variants to a GWAS trait mediated by gene expression. Statistically TWAS is a (two-sample) 2-stage least squares (2SLS) method in the framework of instrumental variables analysis for causal inference: in Stage 1 it uses the reference eQTL data to impute a genes expression for the main GWAS data, then in Stage 2 it tests for association between the imputed gene expression and the GWAS trait; if an association is detected in Stage 2, a (putatively) causal relationship between the gene and the GWAS trait is claimed. If a nonlinear model or a generalized linear model (GLM) is fitted in Stage 2 (e.g., for a binary GWAS trait), it is known that using only imputed gene expression, as in standard TWAS, in general does not lead to a consistent (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) estimate for the causal effect; accordingly, a variation of 2SLS, called two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), has been proposed to yield better estimates (e.g., being consistent under suitable conditions). Our main goal is to investigate whether it is necessary or even better to apply 2SRI, instead of the standard 2SLS. In addition, due to the use of imputed gene expression (i.e., with measurement errors), it is known that in general some correction to the standard error estimate of the causal effect estimate has to be applied, while in the standard TWAS no correction is applied. Is this an issue? We also compare one-sample 2SLS with two-sample 2SLS (i.e., the standard TWAS). We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and simulated data mimicking the ADNI data to address the above questions. At the end, we conclude that, in practice with the large sample sizes and small effect sizes of genetic variants, the standard TWAS performs well and is recommended.",Genet Epidemiol,2019

31377428,Identification of molecular signatures and pathways to identify novel therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from a systems biomedicine perspective.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. However, there are no peripheral biomarkers available that can detect AD onset. This study aimed to identify the molecular signatures in AD through an integrative analysis of blood gene expression data. We used two microarray datasets (GSE4226 and GSE4229) comparing peripheral blood transcriptomes of AD patients and controls to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene set and protein overrepresentation analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), DEGs-Transcription Factors (TFs) interactions, DEGs-microRNAs (miRNAs) interactions, protein-drug interactions, and protein subcellular localizations analyses were performed on DEGs common to the datasets. We identified 25 common DEGs between the two datasets. Integration of genome scale transcriptome datasets with biomolecular networks revealed hub genes (NOL6, ATF3, TUBB, UQCRC1, CASP2, SND1, VCAM1, BTF3, VPS37B), common transcription factors (FOXC1, GATA2, NFIC, PPARG, USF2, YY1) and miRNAs (mir-20a-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-16-5p, let-7b-5p, mir-708-5p, mir-24-3p, mir-26b-5p, mir-17-5p, mir-193-3p, mir-186-5p). Evaluation of histone modifications revealed that hub genes possess several histone modification sites associated with AD. Protein-drug interactions revealed 10 compounds that affect the identified AD candidate biomolecules, including anti-neoplastic agents (Vinorelbine, Vincristine, Vinblastine, Epothilone D, Epothilone B, CYT997, and ZEN-012), a dermatological (Podofilox) and an immunosuppressive agent (Colchicine). The subcellular localization of molecular signatures varied, including nuclear, plasma membrane and cytosolic proteins. In the present study, it was identified blood-cell derived molecular signatures that might be useful as candidate peripheral biomarkers in AD. It was also identified potential drugs and epigenetic data associated with these molecules that may be useful in designing therapeutic approaches to ameliorate AD.",Genomics,2019
31062029,"The relationship between sleep duration, cognition and dementia: a Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Short and long sleep duration have been linked with poorer cognitive outcomes, but it remains unclear whether these associations are causal.
METHODS: We conducted the first Mendelian randomization (MR) study with 77 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for sleep duration using individual-participant data from the UK Biobank cohort (N = 395 803) and summary statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (N cases/controls = 17 008/37 154) to investigate the potential impact of sleep duration on cognitive outcomes.
RESULTS: Linear MR suggested that each additional hour/day of sleep was associated with 1% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0-2%; P = 0.008] slower reaction time and 3% more errors in visual-memory test (95% CI = 0-6%; P = 0.05). There was little evidence to support associations of increased sleep duration with decline in visual memory [odds ratio (OR) per additional hour/day of sleep = 1.10 (95% CI = 0.76-1.57); P = 0.62], decline in reaction time [OR = 1.28 (95% CI = 0.49-3.35); P = 0.61], all-cause dementia [OR = 1.19 (95% CI = 0.65-2.19); P = 0.57] or Alzheimer's disease risk [OR = 0.89 (95% CI = 0.67-1.18); P = 0.41]. Non-linear MR suggested that both short and long sleep duration were associated with poorer visual memory (P for non-linearity = 3.44e-9) and reaction time (P for non-linearity = 6.66e-16).
CONCLUSIONS: Linear increase in sleep duration has a small negative effect on reaction time and visual memory, but the true association might be non-linear, with evidence of associations for both short and long sleep duration. These findings suggest that sleep duration may represent a potential causal pathway for cognition.",Int J Epidemiol,2019
31771067,Current Issues in Chronic Diseases: A Focus on Dementia and Hypertension in Rural West Texans.,"Dementia and hypertension are chronic diseases that affect elderly populations worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases increases each year, especially in rural and underserved rural communities like West Texas. The purpose of this study was to find risk factors of dementia and their impact on rural West Texans. Data was provided by the Project FRONTIER for rural West Texas counties. The SPSS software package was used for statistical analysis. Pearson's chi-squared test was also utilized to determine the relationships between the risk factors considering a level of significance (α)  = 0.05. The findings have shown that age group had significant associations with hypertension, cerebral, neurologic disease, Romberg test, and muscle strength for both males and females (p≤0.002). Hypertension was significantly associated with cognitive disorder and diabetes in both males and females (p≤0.011). Age group in females was significantly associated with parkinsonism (p = 0.02), neurological stroke (p = 0.002), reflexes (p = 0.003), and sensory intact (hands/feet) (p = 0.004), respectively, whereas age for males was not significantly associated with those variables (p = 0.29, p = 0.05, p = 0.56, and p = 0.76, respectively). Hypertension in females was significantly associated with cardiovascular disease (p = 0.001) and depression (p = 0.001) but was not found to be significant for males (p = 0.30 and p = 0.09, respectively). Both males and females in Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups were found to be significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.045, respectively). Hispanic and non-Hispanic females were found to be significantly associated with hypertension (p = 0.026). Gender-specific differences in dementia risk factors exist and integrating such variables may guide relevant policymaking to reduce dementia incidence in rural West Texas.",J Alzheimers Dis,2019
31640277,GSKIP-Mediated Anchoring Increases Phosphorylation of Tau by PKA but Not by GSK3beta via cAMP/PKA/GSKIP/GSK3/Tau Axis Signaling in Cerebrospinal Fluid and iPS Cells in Alzheimer Disease.,"Based on the protein kinase A (PKA)/GSK3β interaction protein (GSKIP)/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) axis, we hypothesized that these might play a role in Tau phosphorylation. Here, we report that the phosphorylation of Tau Ser409 in SHSY5Y cells was increased by overexpression of GSKIP WT more than by PKA- and GSK3β-binding defective mutants (V41/L45 and L130, respectively). We conducted in vitro assays of various kinase combinations to show that a combination of GSK3β with PKA but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) might provide a conformational shelter to harbor Tau Ser409. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was evaluated to extend the clinical significance of Tau phosphorylation status in Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurological disorders (NAD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We found higher levels of different PKA-Tau phosphorylation sites (Ser214, Ser262, and Ser409) in AD than in NAD, MCI, and normal groups. Moreover, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to produce amyloid precursor protein (APP<sup>WT/D678H</sup>) isogenic mutants. These results demonstrated an enhanced level of phosphorylation by PKA but not by the control. This study is the first to demonstrate a transient increase in phosphor-Tau caused by PKA, but not GSK3β, in the CSF and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of AD, implying that both GSKIP and GSK3β function as anchoring proteins to strengthen the cAMP/PKA/Tau axis signaling during AD pathogenesis.",J Clin Med,2019
31748282,Extracellular Vesicles and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) include exosomes and microvesicles and have been shown to have roles in the CNS ranging from the removal of unwanted biomolecules to intercellular communication to the spread of pathogenic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. EVs carry protein, lipid, and genetic cargo, and research over more than a decade has shown that they contain the misfolded forms of proteins associated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the prion diseases. Altered genetic cargo, usually in the form of miRNAs, have also been identified in EVs patients with these diseases, suggesting that EVs may be a source of disease biomarkers. Whether EVs play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases remains to be firmly established because most current research is performed using cell culture and transgenic animal models. If EVs are identified as a key pathological contributor to neurological conditions, they will form a novel target for therapeutic intervention. This Dual Perspectives article will discuss the current understanding of the role of EVs in neurological diseases and raise some of the limitations of our current understandings of this field.",J Neurosci,2019
31617930,Association of Acquired and Heritable Factors With Intergenerational Differences in Age at Symptomatic Onset of Alzheimer Disease Between Offspring and Parents With Dementia.,"IMPORTANCE: Acquired and heritable traits are associated with dementia risk; however, how these traits are associated with age at symptomatic onset (AAO) of Alzheimer disease (AD) is unknown. Identifying the associations of acquired and heritable factors with variability in intergenerational AAO of AD could facilitate diagnosis, assessment, and counseling of the offspring of parents with AD.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the associations of acquired and heritable factors with intergenerational differences in AAO of AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nested cohort study used data from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center that included community-dwelling participants with symptomatic AD, parental history of dementia, and available DNA data who were enrolled in prospective studies of memory and aging from September 1, 2005, to August 31, 2016. Clinical, biomarker, and genetic data were extracted on January 17, 2017, and data analyses were conducted from July 1, 2017, to August 20, 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The associations of acquired (ie, years of education; body mass index; history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, active depression within 2 years, traumatic brain injury, tobacco use, and unhealthy alcohol use; and retrospective determination of AAO) and heritable factors (ie, ethnicity/race, paternal or maternal inheritance, parental history of early-onset dementia, APOE ε4 allele status, and AD polygenic risk scores) to intergenerational difference in AAO of AD were quantified using stepwise forward multivariable regression. Missense or frameshift variants within genes associated with AD pathogenesis were screened using whole-exome sequencing.
RESULTS: There were 164 participants with symptomatic AD, known parental history of dementia, and available DNA data (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [8.3] years; 90 [54.9%] women) included in this study. Offspring were diagnosed with symptomatic AD a mean (SD) 6.1 (10.7) years earlier than their parents (P < .001). The adjusted R2 for measured acquired and heritable factors for intergenerational difference in AAO of AD was 0.29 (F8,155 = 9.13; P < .001). Paternal (β = -9.52 [95% CI, -13.79 to -5.25]) and maternal (β = -6.68 [95% CI, -11.61 to -1.75]) history of dementia, more years of education (β = -0.58 [95% CI -1.08 to -0.09]), and retrospective determination of AAO (β = -3.46 [95% CI, -6.40 to -0.52]) were associated with earlier-than-expected intergenerational difference in AAO of AD. Parental history of early-onset dementia (β = 21.30 [95% CI, 15.01 to 27.59]), presence of 1 APOE ε4 allele (β = 5.00 [95% CI, 2.11 to 7.88]), and history of hypertension (β = 3.81 [95% CI, 0.88 to 6.74]) were associated with later-than-expected intergenerational difference in AAO of AD. Missense or frameshift variants within genes associated with AD pathogenesis were more common in participants with the greatest unexplained variability in intergenerational AAO of AD (19 of 48 participants [39.6%] vs 26 of 116 participants [22.4%]; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Acquired and heritable factors were associated with a substantial proportion of variability in intergenerational AAO of AD. Variants in genes associated with AD pathogenesis may contribute to unexplained variability, justifying further study.",JAMA Netw Open,2019
31135820,Association of Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease With Elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels and Rare Genetic Coding Variants of APOB.,"IMPORTANCE: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a rare form of Alzheimer disease (AD) with a large genetic basis that is only partially understood. In late-onset AD, elevated circulating cholesterol levels increase AD risk even after adjusting for the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE E4) allele, a major genetic factor for AD and elevated cholesterol levels; however, the role of circulating cholesterol levels in EOAD is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between circulating cholesterol levels and EOAD and to identify genetic variants underlying this possible association.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series, plasma cholesterol levels were directly measured in 267 samples from the AD research centers (ADRCs) of Emory University and University of California, San Francisco, collected from January 21, 2009, through August 21, 2014. The association between cholesterol and EOAD was examined using multiple linear regression. To determine the underlying genetic variants, APOB, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 were sequenced in samples from 2125 EOAD cases and controls recruited from 29 ADRCs from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 23, 2016, through April 10, 2018.
EXPOSURES: Clinical diagnosis, age at clinical diagnosis, plasma cholesterol measures (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B), and genetic variants in APOE, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APOB.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the association between EOAD and plasma cholesterol measures. The secondary outcome was the association between EOAD and the burden of genetic variants in APOB.
RESULTS: Of the 2125 samples that underwent genetic sequencing, 1276 were from women (60.0%) and 654 (30.8%) were from patients with EOAD (mean [SD] ages, 55.6 [4.3] years for cases and 72.0 [9.6] years for controls). APOE E4 explained 10.1% of the variance of EOAD. After controlling for APOE E4, EOAD cases had higher levels of total cholesterol (mean difference [SE], 21.9 [5.2] mg/dL; P = 2.9 × 10-5), LDL-C (mean difference [SE], 22.0 [4.5] mg/dL; P = 1.8 × 10-6), and ApoB (mean difference [SE], 12.0 [2.4] mg/dL; P = 2.0 × 10-6) than controls in 267 frozen samples. Approximately 3% of EOAD cases carried known AD-causing mutations. Gene-based rare variant burden testing in 2066 samples showed that rare APOB coding variants were significantly more abundant in EOAD cases after adjusting for sex, APOE E4, genetic principal components, ADRC center, and batch (effect size, 0.20; P = 4.20 × 10-4).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated LDL-C levels were associated with higher probability of having EOAD, and EOAD cases were enriched for rare coding variants in APOB, which codes for the major protein of LDL-C. Collectively, these novel findings highlight the important role of LDL-C in EOAD pathogenesis and suggest a direct link of APOB variants to AD risk.",JAMA Neurol,2019
31467276,Impaired mitochondrial calcium efflux contributes to disease progression in models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Impairments in neuronal intracellular calcium (<sub>i</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup>) handling may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development.

Here, we report remodeling of the <sub>m</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange machinery in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with AD. In the 3xTg-AD mouse model impaired <sub>m</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux capacity precedes neuropathology. Neuronal deletion of the mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCLX, Slc8b1 gene) accelerated memory decline and increased amyloidosis and tau pathology.

We show that <sub>m</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload contributes to AD progression by promoting superoxide generation, metabolic dysfunction and neuronal cell death. These results provide a link between the calcium dysregulation and metabolic dysfunction hypotheses of AD and suggest <sub>m</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange as potential therapeutic target in AD.",Nat Commun,2019
31695027,Molecular basis for chirality-regulated Aβ self-assembly and receptor recognition revealed by ion mobility-mass spectrometry.,"Despite extensive efforts on probing the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enormous investments into AD drug development, the lack of effective disease-modifying therapeutics and the complexity of the AD pathogenesis process suggest a great need for further insights into alternative AD drug targets. Herein, we focus on the chiral effects of truncated amyloid beta (Aβ) and offer further structural and molecular evidence for epitope region-specific, chirality-regulated Aβ fragment self-assembly and its potential impact on receptor-recognition. A multidimensional ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) analytical platform and in-solution kinetics analysis reveal the comprehensive structural and molecular basis for differential Aβ fragment chiral chemistry, including the differential and cooperative roles of chiral Aβ N-terminal and C-terminal fragments in receptor recognition. Our method is applicable to many other systems and the results may shed light on the potential development of novel AD therapeutic strategies based on targeting the D-isomerized Aβ, rather than natural L-Aβ.",Nat Commun,2019
31300647,Brain somatic mutations observed in Alzheimer's disease associated with aging and dysregulation of tau phosphorylation.,"The role of brain somatic mutations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well understood. Here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584×) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with AD and 11 individuals not affected by AD. The number of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in AD brain specimens increases significantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain is 4.8-fold slower than that in AD blood. The putatively pathogenic brain somatic mutations identified in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals are enriched in PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau. We show that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 leads to a loss-of-function mutation. In vitro mimicking of haploinsufficiency of PIN1 aberrantly increases tau phosphorylation and aggregation. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture underlying the pathogenesis of AD.",Nat Commun,2019
31548716,Chromatin activity at GWAS loci identifies T cell states driving complex immune diseases.,"Immune-disease-associated variants are enriched in active chromatin regions of T cells and macrophages. However, whether these variants function in specific cell states is unknown. Here we stimulated T cells and macrophages in the presence of 13 cytokines and profiled active and open chromatin regions. T cell activation induced major chromatin remodeling, while the presence of cytokines fine-tuned the magnitude of changes. We developed a statistical method that accounts for subtle changes in the chromatin landscape to identify SNP enrichment across cell states. Our results point towards the role of immune-disease-associated variants in early rather than late activation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, with modest differences across cytokines. Furthermore, variants associated with inflammatory bowel disease are enriched in type 1 T helper (T<sub>H</sub>1) cells, whereas variants associated with Alzheimer's disease are enriched in different macrophage cell states. Our results represent an in-depth analysis of immune-disease-associated variants across a comprehensive panel of activation states of T cells and macrophages.",Nat Genet,2019

30617256,Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD.",Nat Genet,2019
31941578,Distance disintegration delineates the brain connectivity failure of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with brain network dysfunction. Network-based investigations of brain connectivity have mainly focused on alterations in the strength of connectivity; however, the network breakdown in AD spectrum is a complex scenario in which multiple pathways of connectivity are affected. To integrate connectivity changes that occur under AD-related conditions, here we developed a novel metric that computes the connectivity distance between cortical regions at the voxel level (or nodes). We studied 114 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, 24 with AD, and 27 healthy controls. Results showed that areas of the default mode network, salience network, and frontoparietal network display a remarkable network separation, or greater connectivity distances, from the rest of the brain. Furthermore, this greater connectivity distance was associated with lower global cognition. Overall, the investigation of AD-related changes in paths and distances of connectivity provides a novel framework for characterizing subjects with cognitive impairment; a framework that integrates the overall network topology changes of the brain and avoids biases toward unreferenced connectivity effects.",Neurobiol Aging,2019
31902521,Normal brain aging and Alzheimer's disease are associated with lower cerebral pH: an in vivo histidine <sup>1</sup>H-MR spectroscopy study.,"It is unclear whether alterations in cerebral pH underlie Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. We performed proton spectroscopy after oral administration of histidine in healthy young and elderly persons and in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia (total N = 147). We measured cerebral tissue pH and ratios of common brain metabolites in relation to phosphocreatine and creatine (Cr) in spectra acquired from the hippocampus, the white matter (WM) of the centrum semiovale, and the cerebellum. Hippocampal pH was inversely associated with age in healthy participants but did not differ between patients and controls. WM pH was low in AD and, to a lesser extent, mild cognitive impairment but not in frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders and pure vascular dementia. Furthermore, WM pH provided incremental diagnostic value in addition to N-acetylaspartate to Cr ratio. Our study suggests that in vivo assessment of pH may be a useful marker for the differentiation between AD and other types of dementia.",Neurobiol Aging,2019
31932050,Cognitive reserve and rate of change in Alzheimer's and cerebrovascular disease biomarkers among cognitively normal individuals.,"We examined whether cognitive reserve (CR) impacts level of, or rate of change in, biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and small-vessel cerebrovascular disease in >250 individuals who were cognitively normal and middle-aged and older at the baseline. The four primary biomarker categories commonly examined in studies of AD were measured longitudinally: cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid (A) and tau (T); cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging measures of neuronal injury (N); and neuroimaging measures of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) to assess cerebrovascular pathology (V). CR was indexed by a composite score including years of education, reading, and vocabulary test performance. Higher CR was associated with lower levels of WMHs, particularly among those who subsequently progressed from normal cognition to MCI. CR was not associated with WMH trajectories. In addition, CR was not associated with either levels of, or rate of change in, A/T/N biomarkers. This may suggest that higher CR is associated with lifestyle factors that reduce levels of cerebrovascular disease, allowing individuals with higher CR to better tolerate other types of pathology.",Neurobiol Aging,2019
31862541,Loss of presenilin 2 age-dependently alters susceptibility to acute seizures and kindling acquisition.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience seizures at higher rates than the general population of that age, suggesting an underexplored role of hyperexcitability in AD. Genetic variants in presenilin (PSEN) 1 and 2 genes lead to autosomal dominant early-onset AD (ADAD); patients with PSEN gene variants also report seizures. Pharmacological control of seizures in AD may be disease-modifying. Preclinical efficacy of FDA-approved antiseizure drugs (ASDs) is well defined in young adult rodents; however, the efficacy of ASDs in aged rodents with chronic seizures is less clear. The mechanism by which ADAD genes lead to AD remains unclear, and even less studied is the pathogenesis of epilepsy in AD. PSEN variants generally all result in a biochemical loss of function (De Strooper, 2007). We herein determined whether well-established models of acute and chronic seizure could be used to explore the relationship between AD genes and seizures through investigating whether loss of normal PSEN2 function age-dependently influenced susceptibility to seizures and/or corneal kindling acquisition. PSEN2 knockout (KO) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were screened from 2- to 10-months-old to establish age-dependent focal seizure threshold. Additionally, PSEN2 KO and WT mice aged 2- and 8-months-old underwent corneal kindling such that mice were aged 3- and 9-months old at the beginning of ASD efficacy testing. We then defined the dose-dependent efficacy of mechanistically distinct ASDs on kindled seizures of young versus aged mice to better understand the applicability of corneal kindling to real-world use for geriatric patients. PSEN2 KO mice demonstrated early-life reductions in seizure threshold. However, kindling acquisition was delayed in 2-month-old PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. Young male WT mice took 24.3 ± 1.3 (S.E.M.) stimulations to achieve kindling criterion, whereas age-matched PSEN2 KO male mice took 41.2 ± 1.1 stimulations (p < .0001). The rate of kindling acquisition of 8-month-old mice was no longer different from WT. This study demonstrates that loss of normal PSEN2 function is associated with age-dependent changes in the in vivo susceptibility to acute seizures and kindling. Loss of normal PSEN2 function may be an underexplored molecular contributor to seizures. The use of validated models of chronic seizures in aged rodents may uncover age-related changes in susceptibility to epileptogenesis and/or ASD efficacy in mice with AD-associated genotypes, which may benefit the management of seizures in AD.",Neurobiol Dis,2019
31066065,Von Economo neurons are part of a larger neuronal population that are selectively vulnerable in C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia.,"AIMS: The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia with a C9orf72 expansion (C9-bvFTD) is characterised by early changes in social-emotional cognition that are linked to the loss of von Economo neurons (VENs). Together with a subset of neighbouring pyramidal neurons, VENs express the GABA receptor subunit theta (GABRQ). It is not known if the selective vulnerability of VENs in C9-bvFTD also includes this GABRQ-expressing population.
METHODS: We quantified VENs and GABRQ immunopositive neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in C9-bvFTD (n = 16), controls (n = 12) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 7). Second, we assessed VENs and GABRQ-expressing populations in relation to the clinicopathological profiles.
RESULTS: We found the number of VENs and GABRQ-expressing neurons and their ratio over the total layer 5 neuronal population was lower in C9-bvFTD compared to control and AD. C9-bvFTD donors with underlying TDP43 type A pathology in the ACC showed the highest loss of GABRQ-expressing neurons. C9-bvFTD donors that did not present with motor neuron disease (MND) symptoms in the first half of their disease course showed a prominent loss of GABRQ-expressing neurons compared to controls. C9-bvFTD donors with no symptoms of psychosis showed a higher loss compared to controls. Across all donors, the number of VENs correlated strongly with the number of GABRQ-expressing neurons.
CONCLUSION: We show that VENs, together with GABRQ-expressing neurons, are selectively vulnerable in C9-bvFTD but are both spared in AD. This suggests they are related and that this GABRQ-expressing population of VENs and pyramidal neurons, is a key modulator of social-emotional functioning.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,2019
31887144,Gene delivery of a modified antibody to Aβ reduces progression of murine Alzheimer's disease.,"Antibody therapies for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) hold promise but have been limited by the inability of these proteins to migrate efficiently across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Central nervous system (CNS) gene transfer by vectors like adeno-associated virus (AAV) overcome this barrier by allowing the bodies' own cells to produce the therapeutic protein, but previous studies using this method to target amyloid-β have shown success only with truncated single chain antibodies (Abs) lacking an Fc domain. The Fc region mediates effector function and enhances antigen clearance from the brain by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated reverse transcytosis and is therefore desirable to include for such treatments. Here, we show that single chain Abs fused to an Fc domain retaining FcRn binding, but lacking Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding, termed a silent scFv-IgG, can be expressed and released into the CNS following gene transfer with AAV. While expression of canonical IgG in the brain led to signs of neurotoxicity, this modified Ab was efficiently secreted from neuronal cells and retained target specificity. Steady state levels in the brain exceeded peak levels obtained by intravenous injection of IgG. AAV-mediated expression of this scFv-IgG reduced cortical and hippocampal plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of progressive β-amyloid plaque accumulation. These findings suggest that CNS gene delivery of a silent anti-Aβ scFv-IgG was well-tolerated, durably expressed and functional in a relevant disease model, demonstrating the potential of this modality for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",PLoS One,2019
31790465,Ginkgo biloba extract increases neurite outgrowth and activates the Akt/mTOR pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has demonstrated efficacy in the cognitive functional neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). With regard to its underlying molecular mode of action, first evidence was provided that GBE was able to modulate neuronal outgrowth in vitro, but the mechanisms underlying GBE effects on neuroplasticity remain unclear.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated the effect of GBE on neurite outgrowth using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a 2D and 3D surface culture. The effects of the GBE LI1370 on neuroplasticity and neurite outgrowth were compared to those of nerve growth factor (NGF, 50 ng/ml) which was used as a positive control. We evaluated several parameters of neurite outgrowth such as the neurite number, total neurite length and extend of branching. Our findings showed that GBE (10 and 100 μg/ml) significantly increased neurite outgrowth in the 2D as well as 3D culture model after 3 days of treatment with a comparable effect than that NGF. The use of the 3D cell culture allowed us to better reproduce the in vivo neuronal microenvironment for the evaluation the neurite formation after GBE treatment. In addition, we assessed the effects of GBE on the Akt/mTOR pathway, which is known to promote neuroplasticity induced by nerve growth factors. We showed that GBE treatment induced an increase of phosphorylated IGF1R (Tyr1135/Tyr1136), Akt (Ser473), TSC2 (Ser939), mTOR (Ser2448), PTEN (Ser380) and GSK3β (Ser9).
CONCLUSION: Together, these findings indicate that GBE promotes neurite growth and activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway suggesting that this plant extract supports neuronal plasticity.",PLoS One,2019
31774837,Discovering novel disease comorbidities using electronic medical records.,"Increasing reliance on electronic medical records at large medical centers provides unique opportunities to perform population level analyses exploring disease progression and etiology. The massive accumulation of diagnostic, procedure, and laboratory codes in one place has enabled the exploration of co-occurring conditions, their risk factors, and potential prognostic factors. While most of the readily identifiable associations in medical records are (now) well known to the scientific community, there is no doubt many more relationships are still to be uncovered in EMR data. In this paper, we introduce a novel finding index to help with that task. This new index uses data mined from real-time PubMed abstracts to indicate the extent to which empirically discovered associations are already known (i.e., present in the scientific literature). Our methods leverage second-generation p-values, which better identify associations that are truly clinically meaningful. We illustrate our new method with three examples: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer's Disease, and Optic Neuritis. Our results demonstrate wide utility for identifying new associations in EMR data that have the highest priority among the complex web of correlations and causalities. Data scientists and clinicians can work together more effectively to discover novel associations that are both empirically reliable and clinically understudied.",PLoS One,2019
31882662,BACE1 partial deletion induces synaptic plasticity deficit in adult mice.,"BACE1 is the first enzyme involved in APP processing, thus it is a strong therapeutic target candidate for Alzheimer's disease. The observation of deleterious phenotypes in BACE1 Knock-out (KO) mouse models (germline and conditional) raised some concerns on the safety and tolerability of BACE1 inhibition. Here, we have employed a tamoxifen inducible BACE1 conditional Knock-out (cKO) mouse model to achieve a controlled partial depletion of BACE1 in adult mice. Biochemical and behavioural characterization was performed at two time points: 4-5 months (young mice) and 12-13 months (aged mice). A ~50% to ~70% BACE1 protein reduction in hippocampus and cortex, respectively, induced a significant reduction of BACE1 substrates processing and decrease of Aβx-40 levels at both ages. Hippocampal axonal guidance and peripheral nerve myelination were not affected. Aged mice displayed a CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) deficit that was not associated with memory impairment. Our findings indicate that numerous phenotypes observed in germline BACE1 KO reflect a fundamental role of BACE1 during development while other phenotypes, observed in adult cKO, may be absent when partially rather than completely deleting BACE1. However, we demonstrated that partial depletion of BACE1 still induces CA1 LTP impairment, supporting a role of BACE1 in synaptic plasticity in adulthood.",Sci Rep,2019
31712553,Sex-specific depressive symptoms as markers of pre-Alzheimer dementia: findings from the Three-City cohort study.,"Late-life depression, as a potential marker of pre-dementia, has seldom been explored by symptom dimension and sex, despite sexual dimorphic differences. This study aimed to examine whether specific depressive dimensions were associated with pre-Alzheimer's disease dementia (pre-AD), separately for women and men. Data were drawn from 5617 (58% women) community-dwellers aged 65+ recruited in 1999-2000 and followed at 2-year intervals for 12 years. We used Cox proportional hazard models to study associations between time-dependent Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) symptom dimensions (namely somatic, depressed, positive affect, and interpersonal challenge) and pre-AD, defined retrospectively from validated diagnoses established 3.5 (IQR: 3.2-4.0) years onwards. Analyses were performed according to overall depressive symptomatology (DS+: CES-D score ≥ 16) and antidepressant/anxiolytic medication use (AA). Results indicated that in DS+ women only, all four dimensions were significantly associated with pre-AD in the AA- group, in particular somatic item 'Mind' and depressed affect items 'Depressed' and 'Blues'. The most depression-specific dimension, depressed affect, was also significantly associated with pre-AD in the DS- AA- women (HR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.12;1.47). In both sexes, in the DS- groups somatic affect was the most robust pre-AD marker, irrespective of treatment (women: HR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.08;1.38; men: HR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.14;1.48). Our findings highlight sex-specific associations between depressive symptom dimensions and pre-AD, modulated by depressive symptomatology and treatment. Assessment of specific symptom dimensions taking into account overall symptomatology and treatment could help identify and target high-risk AD-dementia profiles for interventions.",Transl Psychiatry,2019

31028242,"Chronic stress triggers divergent dendritic alterations in immature neurons of the adult hippocampus, depending on their ultimate terminal fields.","Chronic stress, a suggested precipitant of brain pathologies, such as depression and Alzheimer's disease, is known to impact on brain plasticity by causing neuronal remodeling as well as neurogenesis suppression in the adult hippocampus. Although many studies show that stressful conditions reduce the number of newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), little is known about whether and how stress impacts on dendritic development and structural maturation of these newborn neurons. We, herein, demonstrate that chronic stress impacts differentially on doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons in distinct phases of maturation. Specifically, the density of the DCX-positive immature neurons whose dendritic tree reaches the inner molecular layer (IML) of DG is reduced in stressed animals, whereas their dendritic complexity is increased. On the contrary, no change on the density of DCX-positive neurons whose dendritic tree extends to the medial/outer molecular layer (M/OML) of the DG is found under stress conditions, whereas the dendritic complexity of these cells is diminished. In addition, DCX+ cells displayed a more complex and longer arbor in the dendritic compartments located in the granular cell layer of the DG under stress conditions; on the contrary, their dendritic segments localized into the M/OML were shorter and less complex. These findings suggest that the neuroplastic effects of chronic stress on dendritic maturation and complexity of DCX+ immature neurons vary based on the different maturation stage of DCX-positive cells and the different DG sublayer, highlighting the complex and dynamic stress-driven neuroplasticity of immature neurons in the adult hippocampus.",Transl Psychiatry,2019

31802237,Necrosome complex detected in granulovacuolar degeneration is associated with neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a specific pattern of neuropathological changes, including extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) representing cytoplasmic vacuolar lesions, synapse dysfunction and neuronal loss. Necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis characterized by the assembly of the necrosome complex composed of phosphorylated proteins, i.e. receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and 3 (pRIPK1 and pRIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), has recently been shown to be involved in AD. However, it is not yet clear whether necrosome assembly takes place in brain regions showing AD-related neuronal loss and whether it is associated with AD-related neuropathological changes. Here, we analyzed brains of AD, pathologically defined preclinical AD (p-preAD) and non-AD control cases to determine the neuropathological characteristics and distribution pattern of the necrosome components. We demonstrated that all three activated necrosome components can be detected in GVD lesions (GVDn+, i.e. GVD with activated necrosome) in neurons, that they colocalize with classical GVD markers, such as pTDP-43 and CK1δ, and similarly to these markers detect GVD lesions. GVDn + neurons inversely correlated with neuronal density in the early affected CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the late affected frontal cortex layer III. Additionally, AD-related GVD lesions were associated with AD-defining parameters, showing the strongest correlation and partial colocalization with NFT pathology. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of the necrosome in GVD plays a role in AD, possibly by representing an AD-specific form of necroptosis-related neuron death. Hence, necroptosis-related neuron loss could be an interesting therapeutic target for treating AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2020
32720099,Plasma p-tau181 accurately predicts Alzheimer's disease pathology at least 8 years prior to post-mortem and improves the clinical characterisation of cognitive decline.,"The neuropathological confirmation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) remains the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nowadays, the in vivo diagnosis of AD is greatly aided by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers. Although highly accurate, their broad implementation is restricted by high cost, limited accessibility and invasiveness. We recently developed a high-performance, ultrasensitive immunoassay for the quantification of tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau181) in plasma, which identifies AD pathophysiology with high accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether plasma p-tau181, measured years before the death, can predict the eventual neuropathological confirmation of AD, and successfully discriminates AD from non-AD dementia pathologies. We studied a unique cohort of 115 individuals with longitudinal blood collections with clinical evaluation at 8, 4 and 2 years prior to neuropathological assessment at death. The results demonstrate that plasma p-tau181 associates better with AD neuropathology and Braak staging than a clinical diagnosis 8 years before post-mortem. Moreover, while all patients had a diagnosis of AD dementia during life, plasma p-tau181 proved to discriminate AD from non-AD pathologies with high accuracy (AUC = 97.4%, 95% CI = 94.1-100%) even 8 years before death. Additionally, the longitudinal trajectory of plasma p-tau181 was assessed in all patients. We found that the main increases in plasma p-tau181 occurred between 8 and 4 years prior to death in patients with AD neuropathology and later plateauing. In contrast, non-AD pathologies and controls exhibited minor, albeit significant, increases in p-tau181 up until death. Overall, our study demonstrates that plasma p-tau181 is highly predictive and specific of AD neuropathology years before post-mortem examination. These data add further support for the use of plasma p-tau181 to aid clinical management in primary care and recruitment for clinical trials.",Acta Neuropathol,2020

33079262,"Accumulation of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments triggers mitochondrial structure, function, and mitophagy defects in Alzheimer's disease models and human brains.","Several lines of recent evidence indicate that the amyloid precursor protein-derived C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) could correspond to an etiological trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Altered mitochondrial homeostasis is considered an early event in AD development. However, the specific contribution of APP-CTFs to mitochondrial structure, function, and mitophagy defects remains to be established. Here, we demonstrate in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing either APP Swedish mutations, or the β-secretase-derived APP-CTF fragment (C99) combined with β- and γ-secretase inhibition, that APP-CTFs accumulation independently of Aβ triggers excessive mitochondrial morphology alteration (i.e., size alteration and cristae disorganization) associated with enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. APP-CTFs accumulation also elicit basal mitophagy failure illustrated by enhanced conversion of LC3, accumulation of LC3-I and/or LC3-II, non-degradation of SQSTM1/p62, inconsistent Parkin and PINK1 recruitment to mitochondria, enhanced levels of membrane and matrix mitochondrial proteins, and deficient fusion of mitochondria with lysosomes. We confirm the contribution of APP-CTFs accumulation to morphological mitochondria alteration and impaired basal mitophagy in vivo in young 3xTgAD transgenic mice treated with γ-secretase inhibitor as well as in adeno-associated-virus-C99 injected mice. Comparison of aged 2xTgAD and 3xTgAD mice indicates that, besides APP-CTFs, an additional contribution of Aβ to late-stage mitophagy activation occurs. Importantly, we report on mitochondrial accumulation of APP-CTFs in human post-mortem sporadic AD brains correlating with mitophagy failure molecular signature. Since defective mitochondria homeostasis plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis, targeting mitochondrial dysfunctions and/or mitophagy by counteracting early APP-CTFs accumulation may represent relevant therapeutic interventions in AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2020
32043162,Identification of early pericyte loss and vascular amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease retina.,"Pericyte loss and deficient vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) signaling are prominent features of the blood-brain barrier breakdown described in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can predict cognitive decline yet have never been studied in the retina. Recent reports using noninvasive retinal amyloid imaging, optical coherence tomography angiography, and histological examinations support the existence of vascular-structural abnormalities and vascular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposits in retinas of AD patients. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of such retinal vascular pathology were not previously explored. Here, by modifying a method of enzymatically clearing non-vascular retinal tissue and fluorescent immunolabeling of the isolated blood vessel network, we identified substantial pericyte loss together with significant Aβ deposition in retinal microvasculature and pericytes in AD. Evaluation of postmortem retinas from a cohort of 56 human donors revealed an early and progressive decrease in vascular PDGFRβ in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to cognitively normal controls. Retinal PDGFRβ loss significantly associated with increased retinal vascular Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> burden. Decreased vascular LRP-1 and early apoptosis of pericytes in AD retina were also detected. Mapping of PDGFRβ and Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels in pre-defined retinal subregions indicated that certain geometrical and cellular layers are more susceptible to AD pathology. Further, correlations were identified between retinal vascular abnormalities and cerebral Aβ burden, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and clinical status. Overall, the identification of pericyte and PDGFRβ loss accompanying increased vascular amyloidosis in Alzheimer's retina implies compromised blood-retinal barrier integrity and provides new targets for AD diagnosis and therapy.",Acta Neuropathol,2020
33369003,Antiallergic drug desloratadine as a selective antagonist of 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor ameliorates pathology of Alzheimer's disease model mice by improving microglial dysfunction.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive deficits and alteration of personality and behavior. As yet, there is no efficient treatment for AD. 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5HT<sub>2A</sub> R) is a subtype of 5HT<sub>2</sub> receptor belonging to the serotonin receptor family, and its antagonists have been clinically used as antipsychotics to relieve psychopathy. Here, we discovered that clinically first-line antiallergic drug desloratadine (DLT) functioned as a selective antagonist of 5HT<sub>2A</sub> R and efficiently ameliorated pathology of APP/PS1 mice. The underlying mechanism has been intensively investigated by assay against APP/PS1 mice with selective 5HT<sub>2A</sub> R knockdown in the brain treated by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-ePHP-si-5HT<sub>2A</sub> R. DLT reduced amyloid plaque deposition by promoting microglial Aβ phagocytosis and degradation, and ameliorated innate immune response by polarizing microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. It stimulated autophagy process and repressed neuroinflammation through 5HT<sub>2A</sub> R/cAMP/PKA/CREB/Sirt1 pathway, and activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation to upregulate the transcriptions of phagocytic receptors TLR2 and TLR4 in response to microglial phagocytosis stimulation. Together, our work has highly supported that 5HT<sub>2A</sub> R antagonism might be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD and highlighted the potential of DLT in the treatment of this disease.",Aging Cell,2020
33270373,"Diet, psychosocial stress, and Alzheimer's disease-related neuroanatomy in female nonhuman primates.","INTRODUCTION: Associations between diet, psychosocial stress, and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been reported, but causal relationships are difficult to determine in human studies.
METHODS: We used structural magnetic resonance imaging in a well-validated non-human primate model of AD-like neuropathology to examine the longitudinal effects of diet (Mediterranean vs Western) and social subordination stress on brain anatomy, including global volumes, cortical thicknesses and volumes, and 20 individual regions of interest (ROIs).
RESULTS: Western diet resulted in greater cortical thicknesses, total brain volumes, and gray matter, and diminished cerebrospinal fluid and white matter volumes. Socially stressed subordinates had smaller whole brain volumes but larger ROIs relevant to AD than dominants.
DISCUSSION: The observation of increased size of AD-related brain areas is consistent with similar reports of mid-life volume increases predicting increased AD risk later in life. While the biological mechanisms underlying the findings require future investigation, these observations suggest that Western diet and psychosocial stress instigate pathologic changes that increase risk of AD-associated neuropathology, whereas the Mediterranean diet may protect the brain.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
33215852,Development and validation of the Uniform Data Set (v3.0) executive function composite score (UDS3-EF).,"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive composite scores offer a means of precisely measuring executive functioning (EF).
METHODS: We developed the Uniform Data Set v3.0 EF composite score (UDS3-EF) in 3507 controls from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset using item-response theory and applied nonlinear and linear demographic adjustments. The UDS3-EF was validated with other neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging from independent research cohorts using linear models.
RESULTS: Final model fit was good-to-excellent: comparative fit index = 0.99; root mean squared error of approximation = 0.057. UDS3-EF scores differed across validation cohorts (controls > mild cognitive impairment > Alzheimer's disease-dementia ≈ behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; P < 0.001). The UDS3-EF correlated most strongly with other EF tests (βs = 0.50 to 0.85, Ps < 0.001) and more with frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe gray matter volumes (βs = 0.18 to 0.33, Ps ≤ 0.004) than occipital gray matter (β = 0.12, P = 0.04). The total sample needed to detect a 40% reduction in UDS3-EF change (n = 286) was ≈40% of the next best measure (F-words; n = 714).
CONCLUSIONS: The UDS3-EF is well suited to quantify EF in research and clinical trials and offers psychometric and practical advantages over its component tests.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
33226735,ATN incorporating cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain detects frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"INTRODUCTION: The ATN framework provides an in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of pathologic amyloid plaques (A), tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N). ATN is rarely evaluated in pathologically confirmed patients and its poor sensitivity to suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiologies (SNAP), including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), leads to misdiagnoses. We compared accuracy of ATN (ATN<sub>TAU</sub> ) using CSF total tau (t-tau) to a modified strategy (ATN<sub>NfL</sub> ) using CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) in an autopsy cohort.
METHODS: ATN<sub>TAU</sub> and ATN<sub>NfL</sub> were trained in an independent sample and validated in autopsy-confirmed AD (n = 67) and FTLD (n = 27).
RESULTS: ATN<sub>NfL</sub> more accurately identified FTLD as SNAP (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.94) than ATN<sub>TAU</sub> (sensitivity = 0.44, specificity = 0.97), even in cases with co-occurring AD and FTLD. ATN<sub>NfL</sub> misclassified fewer AD and FTLD as ""Normal"" (2%) than ATN<sub>TAU</sub> (14%).
DISCUSSION: ATN<sub>NfL</sub> is a promising diagnostic strategy that may accurately identify both AD and FTLD, even when pathologies co-occur.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
33215873,Item response theory analysis of the Clinical Dementia Rating.,"INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is widely used in Alzheimer's disease research studies and has well established reliability and validity. To facilitate the development of an online, electronic CDR (eCDR) for more efficient clinical applications, this study aims to produce a shortened version of the CDR, and to develop the statistical model for automatic scoring.
METHODS: Item response theory (IRT) was used for item evaluation and model development. An automatic scoring algorithm was validated using existing CDR global and domain box scores as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Most CDR items discriminate well at mild and very mild levels of cognitive impairment. The bi-factor IRT model fits best and the shortened CDR still demonstrates very high classification accuracy (81%∼92%).
DISCUSSION: The shortened version of the CDR and the automatic scoring algorithm has established a good foundation for developing an eCDR and will ultimately improve the efficiency of cognitive assessment.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
33103819,A ketogenic drink improves cognition in mild cognitive impairment: Results of a 6-month RCT.,"INTRODUCTION: Counteracting impaired brain glucose metabolism with ketones may improve cognition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Cognition, plasma ketone response, and metabolic profile were assessed before and 6 months after supplementation with a ketogenic drink containing medium chain triglyceride (ketogenic medium chain triglyceride [kMCT]; 15 g twice/day; n = 39) or placebo (n = 44).
RESULTS: Free and cued recall (Trial 1; P = .047), verbal fluency (categories; P = .024), Boston Naming Test (total correct answers; P = .033), and the Trail-Making Test (total errors; P = .017) improved significantly in the kMCT group compared to placebo (analysis of covariance; pre-intervention score, sex, age, education, and apolipoprotein E4 as covariates). Some cognitive outcomes also correlated positively with plasma ketones. Plasma metabolic profile and ketone response were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: This kMCT drink improved cognitive outcomes in MCI, at least in part by increasing blood ketone level. These data support further assessment of MCI progression to Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
33325137,Recognizing African-American contributions to neurology: The role of Solomon Carter Fuller (1872-1953) in Alzheimer's disease research.,"Solomon Carter Fuller (1872-1953) is widely acknowledged as the first African-American psychiatrist but underappreciated as a pioneer of Alzheimer's disease. He immigrated to the United States from Liberia at age 17 and excelled in his medical career to become associate professor of both pathology and neurology at Boston University by 1921. He was one of five research assistants selected by Alois Alzheimer to work in his laboratory at the Royal Psychiatric Hospital in Munich, an experience that arguably paved the way for trailblazing research in Alzheimer's disease. Dr Fuller was the first to translate much of Alzheimer's pivotal work into English, including that of Auguste Deter, the first reported case of the disease. He published what is now recognized to be the first comprehensive review of Alzheimer's disease, in it reporting the ninth case ever described. His achievements, in a period when African-American physicians were under-represented, merit greater recognition.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
33213489,Amyloid biomarkers as predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia: a comparison of methods.,"BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) PET is an established predictor of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia (AD). We compared three PET (including an approach based on voxel-wise Cox regression) and one cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outcome measures in their predictive power.
METHODS: Datasets were retrieved from the ADNI database. In a training dataset (N = 159), voxel-wise Cox regression and principal component analyses were used to identify conversion-related regions (Cox-VOI and AD conversion-related pattern (ADCRP), respectively). In a test dataset (N = 129), the predictive value of mean normalized <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir uptake (SUVR) in AD-typical brain regions (composite SUVR) or the Cox-VOI and the pattern expression score (PES) of ADCRP and CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> as predictors were compared by Cox models (corrected for age and sex).
RESULTS: All four Aβ measures were significant predictors (p &lt; 0.001). Prediction accuracies (Harrell's c) showed step-wise significant increases from Cox-SUVR (c = 0.71; HR = 1.84 per Z-score increase), composite SUVR (c = 0.73; HR = 2.18), CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> (c = 0.75; HR = 3.89) to PES (c = 0.77; HR = 2.71).
CONCLUSION: The PES of ADCRP is the most predictive Aβ PET outcome measure, comparable to CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>, with a slight but statistically significant advantage.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2020
33220712,Smaller pineal gland is associated with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between pineal gland volume and symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients without any feature of dementia with Lewy bodies.
METHODS: We enrolled 296 community-dwelling probable AD patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for possible or probable dementia with Lewy bodies. Among them, 93 were amyloid beta (Aβ) positive on <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben amyloid brain positron emission tomography. We measured RBD symptoms using the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and defined probable RBD (pRBD) as the RBDSQ of 5 or higher. We manually segmented pineal gland on 3T structural T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: The participants with pRBD had smaller pineal parenchyma volume (VPP) than those without pRBD (p <  0.001). The smaller the VPP, the more severe the RBD symptoms (p <  0.001). VPP was inversely associated with risk of prevalent pRBD (odds ratio = 0.909, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.878-0.942, p <  0.001). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for pRBD of VPP was 0.80 (95% CI = 0.750-0.844, p <  0.0001). These results were not changed when we analyzed the 93 participants with Aβ-positive AD separately.
CONCLUSIONS: In AD patients, reduced pineal gland volume may be associated with RBD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2020
33213512,Genetic associations of in vivo pathology influence Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.,"INTRODUCTION: Although the heritability of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is estimated to be 60-80%, addressing the genetic contribution to AD risk still remains elusive. More specifically, it remains unclear whether genetic variants are able to affect neurodegenerative brain features that can be addressed by in vivo imaging techniques.
METHODS: Targeted sequencing analysis of the coding and UTR regions of 132 AD susceptibility genes was performed. Neuroimaging data using <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET), <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and MRI that are available from the KBASE (Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's disease) cohort were acquired. A total of 557 participants consisted of 336 cognitively normal (CN) adults, 137 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 84 AD dementia (ADD) groups.
RESULTS: We called 5391 high-quality single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on AD susceptibility genes and selected significant associations between variants and five in vivo AD pathologies: (1) amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, (2) AD-signature region cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-Cm), (3) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) cerebral glucose metabolism (PCC-Cm), (4) AD-signature region cortical thickness (AD-Ct), and (5) hippocampal volume (Hv). The association analysis for common variants (allele frequency (AF) > 0.05) yielded several novel loci associated with Aβ deposition (PIWIL1-rs10848087), AD-Cm (NME8-rs2722372 and PSEN2-rs75733498), AD-Ct (PSEN1-rs7523) and, Hv (CASS4-rs3746625). Meanwhile, in a gene-based analysis for rare variants (AF < 0.05), cases carrying rare variants in LPL, FERMT2, NFAT5, DSG2, and ITPR1 displayed associations with the neuroimaging features. Exploratory voxel-based brain morphometry between the variant carriers and non-carriers was performed subsequently. Finally, we document a strong association of previously reported APOE variants with the in vivo AD pathologies and demonstrate that the variants exert a causal effect on AD susceptibility via neuroimaging features.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel associations of genetic factors to Aβ accumulation and AD-related neurodegeneration to influence AD susceptibility.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2020
32330418,Non-coding and Loss-of-Function Coding Variants in TET2 are Associated with Multiple Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"We conducted genome sequencing to search for rare variation contributing to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Discovery analysis was conducted on 435 cases and 671 controls of European ancestry. Burden testing for rare variation associated with disease was conducted using filters based on variant rarity (less than one in 10,000 or private), computational prediction of deleteriousness (CADD) (10 or 15 thresholds), and molecular function (protein loss-of-function [LoF] only, coding alteration only, or coding plus non-coding variants in experimentally predicted regulatory regions). Replication analysis was conducted on 16,434 independent cases and 15,587 independent controls. Rare variants in TET2 were enriched in the discovery combined EOAD and FTD cohort (p = 4.6 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, genome-wide corrected p = 0.0026). Most of these variants were canonical LoF or non-coding in predicted regulatory regions. This enrichment replicated across several cohorts of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and FTD (replication only p = 0.0029). The combined analysis odds ratio was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.4) for AD and FTD. The odds ratio for qualifying non-coding variants considered independently from coding variants was 3.7 (95% CI 1.7-9.4). For LoF variants, the combined odds ratio (for AD, FTD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which shares clinicopathological overlap with FTD) was 3.1 (95% CI 1.9-5.2). TET2 catalyzes DNA demethylation. Given well-defined changes in DNA methylation that occur during aging, rare variation in TET2 may confer risk for neurodegeneration by altering the homeostasis of key aging-related processes. Additionally, our study emphasizes the relevance of non-coding variation in genetic studies of complex disease.",Am J Hum Genet,2020
32413284,Characterizing the Causal Pathway for Genetic Variants Associated with Neurological Phenotypes Using Human Brain-Derived Proteome Data.,"Leveraging high-dimensional molecular datasets can help us develop mechanistic insight into associations between genetic variants and complex traits. In this study, we integrated human proteome data derived from brain tissue to evaluate whether targeted proteins putatively mediate the effects of genetic variants on seven neurological phenotypes (Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, insomnia, intelligence, neuroticism, and schizophrenia). Applying the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) systematically across the genome highlighted 43 effects between genetically predicted proteins derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and these outcomes. Furthermore, genetic colocalization provided evidence that the same causal variant at 12 of these loci was responsible for variation in both protein and neurological phenotype. This included genes such as DCC, which encodes the netrin-1 receptor and has an important role in the development of the nervous system (p = 4.29 × 10<sup>-11</sup> with neuroticism), as well as SARM1, which has been previously implicated in axonal degeneration (p = 1.76 × 10<sup>-08</sup> with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We additionally conducted a phenome-wide MR study for each of these 12 genes to assess potential pleiotropic effects on 700 complex traits and diseases. Our findings suggest that genes such as SNX32, which was initially associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease, may potentially influence other complex traits in the opposite direction. In contrast, genes such as CTSH (which was also associated with Alzheimer disease) and SARM1 may make worthwhile therapeutic targets because they did not have genetically predicted effects on any of the other phenotypes after correcting for multiple testing.",Am J Hum Genet,2020
32619001,Genome-wide association studies of brain imaging data via weighted distance correlation.,"MOTIVATION: Imaging genetics is mainly used to reveal the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric risk genes and understand the relationship between human brain structure, functional and individual differences. Increasingly, the brain-wide imaging phenotypes in voxels are available to test the association with genetic markers. A challenge with analyzing such data is their high dimensionality and complex relationships.
RESULTS: To tackle this challenge, we introduce a weighed distance correlation (wdCor) that can assess the association between genetic markers and voxel-based imaging data. Importantly, the wdCor test takes the voxel-based data as a whole multivariate phenotype, which preserves the spatial continuity and might enhance the power. Besides, an adaptive permutation procedure is introduced to determine the P-values of the wdCor test and also alleviate the computational burden in GWAS. In extensive simulation studies, wdCor achieves much better performances compared to the original distance correlation. We also successfully apply wdCor to conduct a large-scale analysis on data from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging project (ADNI).
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our wdCor method provides new research directions and ideas for multivariate analysis of high-dimensional data, it can also be used as a tool for scientific analysis of imaging genetics research in practical applications. The R package wdcor, and the code for reproducing all results in this article is available in Github: https://github.com/yangyuhui0129/wdcor.

33188391,Neuropsychiatric symptoms in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease.,"There is clinical overlap between presentations of dementia due to limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that the combination of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC) and LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) is associated with greater neuropsychiatric symptom burden, compared to either pathology alone. Longitudinal Neuropsychiatric Inventory and psychotropic medication prescription data from neuropathologically diagnosed pure ADNC (n = 78), pure LATE-NC (n = 14) and mixed ADNC/LATE-NC (n = 39) brain bank donors were analysed using analysis of variance and linear mixed effects regression models to examine the relationship between diagnostic group and neuropsychiatric symptom burden. Nearly all donors had dementia; three (two pure LATE-NC and one pure ADNC) donors had mild cognitive impairment and another two donors with LATE-NC did not have dementia. The mixed ADNC/LATE-NC group was older than the pure ADNC group, had a higher proportion of females compared to the pure ADNC and LATE-NC groups, and had more severe dementia versus the pure LATE-NC group. After adjustment for length of follow-up, cognitive and demographic factors, mixed ADNC/LATE-NC was associated with lower total Neuropsychiatric Inventory and agitation factor scores than pure ADNC, and lower frontal factor scores than pure LATE-NC. Our findings indicate that concomitant LATE pathology in Alzheimer's disease is not associated with greater neuropsychiatric symptom burden. Future longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate whether mixed ADNC/LATE-NC may be protective against agitation and frontal symptoms in dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or LATE pathology.",Brain,2020
32591831,MRI signatures of brain age and disease over the lifespan based on a deep brain network and 14 468 individuals worldwide.,"Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach to constructing imaging signatures of normal brain ageing as well as of various neuropathological processes associated with brain diseases. In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to the community for MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general population and over the lifespan.",Brain,2020
33094327,Predicting future rates of tau accumulation on PET.,"Clinical trials with anti-tau drugs will need to target individuals at risk of accumulating tau. Our objective was to identify variables available in a research setting that predict future rates of tau PET accumulation separately among individuals who were either cognitively unimpaired or cognitively impaired. All 337 participants had: a baseline study visit with MRI, amyloid PET, and tau PET exams, at least one follow-up tau PET exam; and met clinical criteria for membership in one of two clinical diagnostic groups: cognitively unimpaired (n = 203); or cognitively impaired (n = 134, a combined group of participants with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome). Our primary analyses were in these two clinical groups; however, we also evaluated subgroups dividing the unimpaired group by normal/abnormal amyloid PET and the impaired group by clinical phenotype (mild cognitive impairment, amnestic dementia, and non-amnestic dementia). Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate associations between age, sex, education, APOE genotype, amyloid and tau PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), cognitive performance, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensity volume at baseline, and the rate of subsequent tau PET accumulation. Log-transformed tau PET SUVR was used as the response and rates were summarized as annual per cent change. A temporal lobe tau PET meta-region of interest was used. In the cognitively unimpaired group, only higher baseline amyloid PET was a significant independent predictor of higher tau accumulation rates (P < 0.001). Higher rates of tau accumulation were associated with faster rates of cognitive decline in the cognitively unimpaired subgroup with abnormal amyloid PET (P = 0.03), but among the subgroup with normal amyloid PET. In the cognitively impaired group, younger age (P = 0.02), higher baseline amyloid PET (P = 0.05), APOE ε4 (P = 0.05), and better cognitive performance (P = 0.05) were significant independent predictors of higher tau accumulation rates. Among impaired individuals, faster cognitive decline was associated with faster rates of tau accumulation (P = 0.01). While we examined many possible predictor variables, our results indicate that screening of unimpaired individuals for potential inclusion in anti-tau trials may be straightforward because the only independent predictor of high tau rates was amyloidosis. In cognitively impaired individuals, imaging and clinical variables consistent with early onset Alzheimer's disease phenotype were associated with higher rates of tau PET accumulation suggesting this may be a highly advantageous group in which to conduct proof-of-concept clinical trials that target tau-related mechanisms. The nature of the dementia phenotype (amnestic versus non-amnestic) did not affect this conclusion.",Brain,2020
32666090,ATN status in amnestic and non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Under the ATN framework, CSF analytes provide evidence of the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease pathological hallmarks: amyloid plaques (A), phosphorylated tau (T), and accompanying neurodegeneration (N). Still, differences in CSF levels across amnestic and non-amnestic variants or due to co-occurring pathologies might lead to misdiagnoses. We assess the diagnostic accuracy of CSF markers for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration in an autopsy cohort of 118 Alzheimer's disease patients (98 amnestic; 20 non-amnestic) and 64 frontotemporal lobar degeneration patients (five amnestic; 59 non-amnestic). We calculated between-group differences in CSF concentrations of amyloid-β1-42 peptide, tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181, total tau, and the ratio of phosphorylated tau to amyloid-β1-42. Results show that non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients were less likely to be correctly classified under the ATN framework using independent, published biomarker cut-offs for positivity. Amyloid-β1-42 did not differ between amnestic and non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses indicated that amyloid-β1-42 was equally effective in discriminating both groups from frontotemporal lobar degeneration. However, CSF concentrations of phosphorylated tau, total tau, and the ratio of phosphorylated tau to amyloid-β1-42 were significantly lower in non-amnestic compared to amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for these markers showed reduced area under the curve when discriminating non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal lobar degeneration, compared to discrimination of amnestic Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In addition, the ATN framework was relatively insensitive to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and these patients were likely to be classified as having normal biomarkers or biomarkers suggestive of primary Alzheimer's disease pathology. We conclude that amyloid-β1-42 maintains high sensitivity to A status, although with lower specificity, and this single biomarker provides better sensitivity to non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease than either the ATN framework or the phosphorylated-tau/amyloid-β1-42 ratio. In contrast, T and N status biomarkers differed between amnestic and non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease; standard cut-offs for phosphorylated tau and total tau may thus result in misclassifications for non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients. Consideration of clinical syndrome may help improve the accuracy of ATN designations for identifying true non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease.",Brain,2020

33184651,Brain network remodelling reflects tau-related pathology prior to memory deficits in Thy-Tau22 mice.,"In Alzheimer's disease, the tauopathy is known as a major mechanism responsible for the development of cognitive deficits. Early biomarkers of such affectations for diagnosis/stratification are crucial in Alzheimer's disease research, and brain connectome studies increasingly show their potential establishing pathology fingerprints at the network level. In this context, we conducted an in vivo multimodal MRI study on young Thy-Tau22 transgenic mice expressing tauopathy, performing resting state functional MRI and structural brain imaging to identify early connectome signatures of the pathology, relating with histological and behavioural investigations. In the prodromal phase of tauopathy, before the emergence of cognitive impairments, Thy-Tau22 mice displayed selective modifications of brain functional connectivity involving three main centres: hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMG) and the isocortical areas, notably the somatosensory (SS) cortex. Each of these regions showed differential histopathological profiles. Disrupted ventral HIP-AMG functional pathway and altered dynamic functional connectivity were consistent with high pathological tau deposition and astrogliosis in both hippocampus and amygdala, and significant microglial reactivity in amygdalar nuclei. These patterns were concurrent with widespread functional hyperconnectivity of memory-related circuits of dorsal hippocampus-encompassing dorsal HIP-SS communication-in the absence of significant cortical histopathological markers. These findings suggest the coexistence of two intermingled mechanisms of response at the functional connectome level in the early phases of pathology: a maladaptive and a likely compensatory response. Captured in the connectivity patterns, such first responses to pathology could further be used in translational investigations as a lead towards an early biomarker of tauopathy as well as new targets for future treatments.",Brain,2020
33296651,Reduction of mNAT1/hNAT2 Contributes to Cerebral Endothelial Necroptosis and Aβ Accumulation in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The contribution and mechanism of cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis are still unclear. Here, we show that venular and capillary cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) are selectively vulnerable to necroptosis in AD. We identify reduced cerebromicrovascular expression of murine N-acetyltransferase 1 (mNat1) in two AD mouse models and hNat2, the human ortholog of mNat1 and a genetic risk factor for type-2 diabetes and insulin resistance, in human AD. mNat1 deficiency in Nat1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and two AD mouse models promotes blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and endothelial necroptosis. Decreased mNat1 expression induces lysosomal degradation of A20, an important regulator of necroptosis, and LRP1β, a key component of LRP1 complex that exports Aβ in cerebral ECs. Selective restoration of cerebral EC expression of mNAT1 delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV) rescues cerebromicrovascular levels of A20 and LRP1β, inhibits endothelial necroptosis and activation, ameliorates mitochondrial fragmentation, reduces Aβ deposits, and improves cognitive function in the AD mouse model.",Cell Rep,2020
32668249,Pathogenic Tau Causes a Toxic Depletion of Nuclear Calcium.,"Synaptic activity-induced calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx and subsequent propagation into the nucleus is a major way in which synapses communicate with the nucleus to regulate transcriptional programs important for activity-dependent survival and memory formation. Nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> shapes the transcriptome by regulating cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB). Here, we utilize a Drosophila model of tauopathy and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from humans with Alzheimer's disease to study the effects of pathogenic tau, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, on nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We find that pathogenic tau depletes nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CREB to drive neuronal death, that CREB-regulated genes are over-represented among differentially expressed genes in tau transgenic Drosophila, and that activation of big potassium (BK) channels elevates nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> and suppresses tau-induced neurotoxicity. Our studies identify nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion as a mechanism contributing to tau-induced neurotoxicity, adding an important dimension to the calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.",Cell Rep,2020
32997994,Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Is Not Suitable for Detection of Microglial Activation Genes in Humans.,"Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is used as an alternative to single-cell RNA-seq, as it allows transcriptomic profiling of frozen tissue. However, it is unclear whether snRNA-seq is able to detect cellular state in human tissue. Indeed, snRNA-seq analyses of human brain samples have failed to detect a consistent microglial activation signature in Alzheimer's disease. Our comparison of microglia from single cells and single nuclei of four human subjects reveals that, although most genes show similar relative abundances in cells and nuclei, a small population of genes (∼1%) is depleted in nuclei compared to whole cells. This population is enriched for genes previously implicated in microglial activation, including APOE, CST3, SPP1, and CD74, comprising 18% of previously identified microglial-disease-associated genes. Given the low sensitivity of snRNA-seq to detect many activation genes, we conclude that snRNA-seq is not suited for detecting cellular activation in microglia in human disease.",Cell Rep,2020
32616071,Wandering along the epigenetic timeline.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy but also healthspan seems inaccessible as of yet but it may become a reality in the foreseeable future. To extend lifespan, it is essential to unveil molecular mechanisms involved in ageing. As for healthspan, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in age-related pathologies is crucial.
MAIN BODY: We focus on the epigenetic side of ageing as ageing is traced by specific epigenetic patterns and can be measured by epigenetic clocks. We discuss to what extent exposure to environmental factor, such as alcohol use, unhealthy diet, tobacco and stress, promotes age-related conditions. We focused on inflammation, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we discuss strategies to reverse time based on epigenetic reprogramming.
CONCLUSIONS: Reversibility of the epigenetic marks makes them promising targets for rejuvenation. For this purpose, a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying ageing is essential. Epigenetic clocks were successfully designed to monitor these mechanisms and the influence of environmental factors. Further studies on age-related diseases should be conducted to determine their epigenetic signature, but also to pinpoint the defect in the epigenetic machinery and thereby identify potential therapeutic targets. As for rejuvenation, epigenetic reprogramming is still at an early stage.",Clin Epigenetics,2020
32419904,Combining data integration and molecular dynamics for target identification in α-Synuclein-aggregating neurodegenerative diseases: Structural insights on Synaptojanin-1 (Synj1).,"Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases hallmarked by the formation of toxic protein aggregates. However, targeting these aggregates therapeutically have thus far shown no success. The treatment of AD has remained particularly problematic since no new drugs have been approved in the last 15 years. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets need to be identified and explored. Here, through the integration of genomic and proteomic data, a set of proteins with strong links to α-synuclein-aggregating neurodegenerative diseases was identified. We propose 17 protein targets that are likely implicated in neurodegeneration and could serve as potential targets. The human phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase synaptojanin-1, which has already been independently confirmed to be implicated in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, was among those identified. Despite its involvement in PD and AD, structural aspects are currently missing at the molecular level. We present the first atomistic model of the 5-phosphatase domain of synaptojanin-1 and its binding to its substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). We determine structural information on the active site including membrane-embedded molecular dynamics simulations. Deficiency of charge within the active site of the protein is observed, which suggests that a second divalent cation is required to complete dephosphorylation of the substrate. The findings in this work shed light on the protein's binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and give additional insight for future targeting of the protein active site, which might be of interest in neurodegenerative diseases where synaptojanin-1 is overexpressed.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,2020
33584248,Microglial Hyperreactivity Evolved to Immunosuppression in the Hippocampus of a Mouse Model of Accelerated Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Traits.,"Neuroinflammation is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to study the glial derangement in AD using diverse experimental models and human brain tissue. Besides classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, we analyzed chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL40) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) that are increasingly being associated with astrogliosis and microgliosis in AD, respectively. The SAMP8 mouse model of accelerated aging and AD traits showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated microglia phenotype. Furthermore, 6-month-old SAMP8 showed an exacerbated inflammatory response to peripheral lipopolysaccharide in the hippocampus and null responsiveness at the advanced age (for this strain) of 12 months. Gene expression of TREM2 was increased in the hippocampus of transgenic 5XFAD mice and in the cingulate cortex of autosomal dominant AD patients, and to a lesser extent in aged SAMP8 mice and sporadic early-onset AD patients. However, gene expression of CHI3L1 was increased in mice but not in human AD brain samples. The results support the relevance of microglia activation in the pathways leading to neurodegeneration and suggest diverse neuroinflammatory responses according to the AD process. Therefore, the SAMP8 mouse model with marked alterations in the dynamics of microglia activation and senescence may provide a complementary approach to transgenic mouse models for the study of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying AD risk and progression.",Front Aging Neurosci,2020
33488674,Studying the Interplay Between Apolipoprotein E and Education on Cognitive Decline in Centenarians Using Bayesian Beta Regression.,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an important risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease in aging individuals. Among the 3 known alleles of this gene: e2, e3, and e4, the e4 allele is associated with faster cognitive decline and increased risk for Alzheimer's and dementia, while the e2 allele has a positive effect on longevity, and possibly on preservation of cognitive function. Education also has an important effect on cognition and longevity but the interplay between APOE and education is not well-characterized. Previous studies of the effect of APOE on cognitive decline often used linear regression with the normality assumption, which may not be appropriate for analyzing bounded and skewed neuropsychological test scores. In this paper, we applied Bayesian beta regression to assess the effect of APOE alleles on cognitive decline in a cohort of centenarians with longitudinal assessment of their cognitive function. The analysis confirmed the negative association between older age and cognition and the beneficial effect of education that persists even at the extreme of human lifespan in carriers of the e3 allele. In addition, the analysis showed an association between APOE and cognition that is modified by education. Surprisingly, an antagonistic interaction existed between higher education and APOE alleles, suggesting that education may reduce the positive effect of APOE e2 and increase the negative effect of APOE e4 at extreme old age.",Front Genet,2020
31821608,Some statistical consideration in transcriptome-wide association studies.,"The methodology of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has become popular in integrating a reference expression quantitative trait (eQTL) data set with an independent main GWAS data set to identify (putatively) causal genes, shedding mechanistic insights to biological pathways from genetic variants to a GWAS trait mediated by gene expression. Statistically TWAS is a (two-sample) 2-stage least squares (2SLS) method in the framework of instrumental variables analysis for causal inference: in Stage 1 it uses the reference eQTL data to impute a genes expression for the main GWAS data, then in Stage 2 it tests for association between the imputed gene expression and the GWAS trait; if an association is detected in Stage 2, a (putatively) causal relationship between the gene and the GWAS trait is claimed. If a nonlinear model or a generalized linear model (GLM) is fitted in Stage 2 (e.g., for a binary GWAS trait), it is known that using only imputed gene expression, as in standard TWAS, in general does not lead to a consistent (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) estimate for the causal effect; accordingly, a variation of 2SLS, called two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), has been proposed to yield better estimates (e.g., being consistent under suitable conditions). Our main goal is to investigate whether it is necessary or even better to apply 2SRI, instead of the standard 2SLS. In addition, due to the use of imputed gene expression (i.e., with measurement errors), it is known that in general some correction to the standard error estimate of the causal effect estimate has to be applied, while in the standard TWAS no correction is applied. Is this an issue? We also compare one-sample 2SLS with two-sample 2SLS (i.e., the standard TWAS). We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and simulated data mimicking the ADNI data to address the above questions. At the end, we conclude that, in practice with the large sample sizes and small effect sizes of genetic variants, the standard TWAS performs well and is recommended.",Genet Epidemiol,2020
32677173,Leveraging existing GWAS summary data of genetically correlated and uncorrelated traits to improve power for a new GWAS.,"In spite of the tremendous success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying genetic variants associated with complex traits and common diseases, many more are yet to be discovered. Hence, it is always desirable to improve the statistical power of GWAS. Paralleling with the intensive efforts of integrating GWAS with functional annotations or other omic data, we propose leveraging other published GWAS summary data to boost statistical power for a new/focus GWAS; the traits of the published GWAS may or may not be genetically correlated with the target trait of the new GWAS. Building on weighted hypothesis testing with a solid theoretical foundation, we develop a novel and effective method to construct single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific weights based on 22 published GWAS data sets with various traits, detecting sometimes dramatically increased numbers of significant SNPs and independent loci as compared to the standard/unweighted analysis. For example, by integrating a schizophrenia GWAS summary data set with 19 other GWAS summary data sets of nonschizophrenia traits, our new method identified 1,585 genome-wide significant SNPs mapping to 15 linkage disequilibrium-independent loci, largely exceeding 818 significant SNPs in 13 independent loci identified by the standard/unweighted analysis; furthermore, using a later and larger schizophrenia GWAS summary data set as the validation data, 1,423 (out of 1,585) significant SNPs identified by the weighted analysis, compared to 705 (out of 818) by the unweighted analysis, were confirmed, while all 15 and 13 independent loci were also confirmed. Similar conclusions were reached with lipids and Alzheimer's disease (AD) traits. We conclude that the proposed approach is simple and cost-effective to improve GWAS power.",Genet Epidemiol,2020
32776088,Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 is a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.,"The role of Discoidin Domain Receptors (DDRs) is poorly understood in neurodegeneration. DDRs are upregulated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (PD), and DDRs knockdown reduces neurotoxic protein levels. Here we show that potent and preferential DDR1 inhibitors reduce neurotoxic protein levels in vitro and in vivo. Partial or complete deletion or inhibition of DDR1 in a mouse model challenged with α-synuclein increases autophagy and reduces inflammation and neurotoxic proteins. Significant changes of cerebrospinal fluid microRNAs that control inflammation, neuronal injury, autophagy and vesicular transport genes are observed in PD with and without dementia and Lewy body dementia, but these changes are attenuated or reversed after treatment with the DDR1 inhibitor, nilotinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DDR1 regulates autophagy and reduces neurotoxic proteins and inflammation and is a therapeutic target in neurodegeneration.",Hum Mol Genet,2020
33104032,Self-Reported Hearing Loss and Longitudinal Cognitive Function in a Cohort Enriched with Risk for Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests hearing loss is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment and dementia, but few studies have examined its relationship to sub-clinical cognitive outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of self-reported hearing loss on longitudinal cognitive function in a risk-enriched cohort of clinically-unimpaired, late middle-aged adults.
METHODS: 579 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) were included. Hearing status was determined via self-reported history of diagnosed hearing loss. Each participant with self-reported hearing loss was age- and sex-matched to two participants who never reported hearing loss using nearest-neighbor matching. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between self-reported hearing loss and age-related cognitive trajectories with covariates of sex, literacy, and ethnicity, person-level random intercepts and age-related slopes. Cognitive outcomes encompassed measures of speed and flexibility, visuospatial memory, and verbal fluency.
RESULTS: Participants with self-reported hearing loss exhibited significantly poorer performance on a speed and flexibility factor score and single test of psychomotor speed and executive function, relative to participants who never reported hearing loss. There was no association between self-reported hearing loss and visuospatial memory or verbal fluency. Longitudinally, self-reported hearing loss was associated with less rapid decline in speed and flexibility and no difference in rate of decline for any other cognitive measure.
CONCLUSION: Self-reported hearing loss was associated with poorer speed and flexibility but not with accelerated decline in any domain studied, contrary to previous findings. Further studies involving behavioral auditory measures in this cohort would clarify the robustness of these findings.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33185601,Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia in Indigenous Populations: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors.,"BACKGROUND: There remains a lack of information and understanding of the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in Indigenous populations. Little evidence available suggests that Indigenous peoples may have disproportionately high rates of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: Given this information, this study systematically explores what risk factors may be associated with ADRD in Indigenous populations.
METHODS: A search of all published literature was conducted in October 2016, March 2018, and July 2019 using Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO. Subject headings explored were inclusive of all terms related to Indigenous persons, dementia, and risk. All relevant words, phrases, and combinations were used. To be included in this systematic review, articles had to display an association of a risk factor and ADRD. Only studies that reported a quantifiable measure of risk, involved human subjects, and were published in English were included.
RESULTS: Of 237 articles originally identified through database searches, 45 were duplicates and 179 did not meet a priori inclusion criteria, resulting in 13 studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.
CONCLUSION: The large number of potentially modifiable risk factors reported relative to non-modifiable risk factors illustrates the importance of socioeconomic context in the pathogenesis of ADRD in Indigenous populations. The tendency to prioritize genetic over social explanations when encountering disproportionately high disease rates in Indigenous populations can distract from modifiable proximal, intermediate, and distal determinants of health.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33074225,Reduction of Dendritic Inhibition in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons in Amyloidosis Models of Early Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: In an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), before the formation of amyloid plaques, neuronal network hyperactivity has been reported in both patients and animal models. This suggests an underlying disturbance of the balance between excitation and inhibition. Several studies have highlighted the role of somatic inhibition in early AD, while less is known about dendritic inhibition.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated how inhibitory synaptic currents are affected by elevated Aβ levels.
METHODS: We performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures after treatment with Aβ-oligomers and in hippocampal brain slices from AppNL-F-G mice (APP-KI).
RESULTS: We found a reduction of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices after 24 h Aβ treatment. sIPSCs with slow rise times were reduced, suggesting a specific loss of dendritic inhibitory inputs. As miniature IPSCs and synaptic density were unaffected, these results suggest a decrease in activity-dependent transmission after Aβ treatment. We observed a similar, although weaker, reduction in sIPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons from APP-KI mice compared to control. When separated by sex, the strongest reduction in sIPSC frequency was found in slices from male APP-KI mice. Consistent with hyperexcitability in pyramidal cells, dendritically targeting interneurons received slightly more excitatory input. GABAergic action potentials had faster kinetics in APP-KI slices.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that Aβ affects dendritic inhibition via impaired action potential driven release, possibly due to altered kinetics of GABAergic action potentials. Reduced dendritic inhibition may contribute to neuronal hyperactivity in early AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33074228,Automated Hippocampal Subfield Volumetric Analyses in Atypical Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) are two of the most common variants of atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both PCA and LPA are associated with relative sparing of hippocampus compared to neocortex, although hippocampal atrophy is observed. It is unclear whether regional patterns of hippocampal subfield involvement differ between PCA and LPA, and whether they differ from typical AD.
OBJECTIVE: To assess volume of specific subfields of the hippocampus in PCA, LPA, and typical AD.
METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with PCA and 77 patients with LPA were recruited and underwent T1-weighted MRI and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET at Mayo Clinic. Thirty-six probable AD patients and 100 controls were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Hippocampal subfield volumes were calculated using Freesurfer, and volumes were compared between PCA, LPA, AD, and controls using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests.
RESULTS: The LPA and PCA groups both showed the most striking abnormalities in CA4, presubiculum, molecular layer of the hippocampus, molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus, and the hippocampal-amygdala transition area, although atrophy was left-sided in LPA. PCA showed smaller volume of right presubiculum compared to LPA, with trends for smaller volumes of right parasubiculum and fimbria. LPA showed a trend for smaller volumes of left CA1 compared to PCA. The AD group showed smaller volumes of the right subiculum, CA1, and presubiculum compared to LPA.
CONCLUSION: Patterns of hippocampal subfield atrophy differ across the different syndromic variants of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33252089,Genetic Factors of Alzheimer's Disease Modulate How Diet is Associated with Long-Term Cognitive Trajectories: A UK Biobank Study.,"BACKGROUND: Fluid intelligence (FI) involves abstract problem-solving without prior knowledge. Greater age-related FI decline increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and recent studies suggest that certain dietary regimens may influence rates of decline. However, it is uncertain how long-term food consumption affects FI among adults with or without familial history of AD (FH) or APOE4 (ɛ4).
OBJECTIVE: Observe how the total diet is associated with long-term cognition among mid- to late-life populations at-risk and not-at-risk for AD.
METHODS: Among 1,787 mid-to-late-aged adult UK Biobank participants, 10-year FI trajectories were modeled and regressed onto the total diet based on self-reported intake of 49 whole foods from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).
RESULTS: Daily cheese intake strongly predicted better FIT scores over time (FH-: β= 0.207, p < 0.001; ɛ4-: β= 0.073, p = 0.008; ɛ4+: β= 0.162, p = 0.001). Alcohol of any type daily also appeared beneficial (ɛ4+: β= 0.101, p = 0.022) and red wine was sometimes additionally protective (FH+: β= 0.100, p = 0.014; ɛ4-: β= 0.59, p = 0.039). Consuming lamb weekly was associated with improved outcomes (FH-: β= 0.066, p = 0.008; ɛ4+: β= 0.097, p = 0.044). Among at risk groups, added salt correlated with decreased performance (FH+: β= -0.114, p = 0.004; ɛ4+: β= -0.121, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Modifying meal plans may help minimize cognitive decline. We observed that added salt may put at-risk individuals at greater risk, but did not observe similar interactions among FH- and AD- individuals. Observations further suggest in risk status-dependent manners that adding cheese and red wine to the diet daily, and lamb on a weekly basis, may also improve long-term cognitive outcomes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33104027,Does a Live Performance Impact Synchronization to Musical Rhythm in Cognitively Impaired Elderly?,"BACKGROUND: Music-based interventions appear to be efficient approaches to improve emotional, social, and cognitive functioning of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE: Because benefits seem to increase with patient's motor involvement, we studied sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) abilities of patients with cognitive impairments (Alzheimer's disease, vascular and mixed dementia) and of patients with no evidence of cognitive impairments. More specifically, we compared the impact of a live performance by a musician to a video recording on SMS.
METHODS: SMS to a metronomic or a musical stimulus was assessed while patients watched a live musician or his pre-recorded video.
RESULTS: SMS to a metronome was better than to music but this effect was modulated by the social context. While SMS to a metronome was better when facing a video than a live performance, there was no impact of social context on SMS to music. No group differences of SMS were found.
CONCLUSION: The decrease in SMS to a metronome in a live performance may be due to social pressure. Such a pressure might be removed in pleasant social activities, like moving with music in a group, explaining the lack of effect on SMS to music. We found no performance differences in groups, suggesting relatively spared SMS in cognitively impaired patients. By showing that it is possible to encourage patients to synchronize with others, even when facing a video, our results indicate that SMS can be used as a relevant predictor in clinical trials and open up promising therapeutic options for isolated patients.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33285629,Targeting Mitophagy in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mitochondria perform many essential cellular functions including energy production, calcium homeostasis, transduction of metabolic and stress signals, and mediating cell survival and death. Maintaining viable populations of mitochondria is therefore critical for normal cell function. The selective disposal of damaged mitochondria, by a pathway known as mitophagy, plays a key role in preserving mitochondrial integrity and quality. Mitophagy reduces the formation of reactive oxygen species and is considered as a protective cellular process. Mitochondrial dysfunction and deficits of mitophagy have important roles in aging and especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeting mitophagy pathways has been suggested to have potential therapeutic effects against AD. In this review, we aim to briefly discuss the emerging concepts on mitophagy, molecular regulation of the mitophagy process, current mitophagy detection methods, and mitophagy dysfunction in AD. Finally, we will also briefly examine the stimulation of mitophagy as an approach for attenuating neurodegeneration in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33104025,The Relationship Between Anxiety and Incident Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been hypothesized to be an expression of anxiety, but whether anxiety early in the course of dementia could be a risk factor for developing later agitation is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to examine the longitudinal relationship between anxiety and incident agitation in individuals with a diagnosis of AD at baseline or during follow-up.
METHODS: Longitudinal neuropsychiatric symptom data from AD individuals who were agitation-free at study baseline (N = 272) were analyzed using mixed effects regression models to test the longitudinal relationship between baseline and incident anxiety with incident agitation.
RESULTS: Anxiety at baseline was not associated with subsequent agitation, but there was a positive linear relationship between incident anxiety and agitation over the study duration. Baseline apathy and delusions were consistently associated with subsequent agitation and greater disease severity and illness duration also appeared to be risk factors for agitation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the concept that anxiety and agitation are likely to be distinct rather than equivalent constructs in mild-moderate AD. Future longitudinal cohort studies are needed to replicate these findings and further characterize potential risk factors for agitation, such as apathy and delusions.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33044185,A Narrative Review of Alzheimer's Disease Stigma.,"As the most common form of senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by a great deal of uncertainty which can lead to fear and stigma for those identified with this devastating disease. As the AD definition evolves from a syndromal to a biological construct, and early diagnoses becomes more commonplace, more confusion and stigma may result. We conducted a narrative review of the literature on AD stigma to consolidate information on this body of research. From the perspective of several stigma theories, we identified relevant studies to inform our understanding of the way in which implementation of the new framework for a biological based AD diagnosis may have resulted in new and emerging stigma. Herein, we discuss the emergence of new AD stigma as our understanding of the definition of the disease changes. We further propose recommendations for future research to reduce the stigma associated with AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33074235,Potential Role for Herpesviruses in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Across the fields of virology and neuroscience, the role of neurotropic viruses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has received renewed enthusiasm, with a particular focus on human herpesviruses (HHVs). Recent genomic analyses of brain tissue collections and investigations of the antimicrobial responses of amyloid-β do not exclude a role of HHVs in contributing to or accelerating AD pathogenesis. Due to continued expansion in our aging cohort and the lack of effective treatments for AD, this composition examines a potential neuroviral theory of AD in light of these recent data. Consideration reveals a possible viral ""Hit-and-Run"" scenario of AD, as well as neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., neuroinflammation, protein quality control, oxidative stress) that may increase risk for AD following neurotropic infection. Although limitations exist, this theoretical framework reveals several novel therapeutic targets that may prove efficacious in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33074241,Antivirals Against SARS-CoV2: Relevance to the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"A recent study in vitro has shown that a sulphated polysaccharide, a type of fucoidan, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-Cov2. If the antiviral action were successful also for COVID-19 patients, it would be enormously valuable against not only acute disease but also long-term mental effects, which might include Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a trial of AD patients, the apparent success of treatment with a polysaccharide, GV971, was suggested to result from antiviral action against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) in brain, a pathogen strongly implicated in AD, and that sulphation of GV971, making it fucoidan-like, might increase its putative antiviral action. These data indicate that treatment of AD patients might be very effective using valacyclovir, a conventional antiviral, which inhibits viral replication, together with a fucoidan, which blocks virus entry into cells.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33300605,Successful Discharge to Community Gap of FFS Medicare Beneficiaries With and Without ADRD Narrowed.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the post-acute and long-term care experience of Medicare beneficiaries with and without Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and whether differences changed from January 1, 2007 to September 30, 2015.
DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional trend study using Medicare claims linked to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Minimum Data Set.
SETTING: CMS-certified skilled nursing facilities (skilled nursing facility (SNF), n = 17,043).
PARTICIPANTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥66 years (n = 6,614,939) discharged from a hospital to a SNF who had not lived in a nursing home during the year before hospitalization.
MEASUREMENTS: ADRD was defined by the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse. Outcome measures included: (1) successful discharge defined as being in SNF less than 90 days, then discharged back to the community, alive without subsequent inpatient health care for 30 continuous days; (2) became long-stay resident in SNF; (3) death in SNF within 90 days; (4) hospital readmission within 30 days of entering SNF; and (5) transferred to another nursing home within 30 days of entering SNF.
RESULTS: Successful discharge of beneficiaries with ADRD increased from 43.4% in 2007 to 53.9% in 2015 (average annual percent change (AAPC) = 2.1 (95% CI = 2.0-2.2)); those without ADRD also increased (from 59.1% to 63.6%, AAPC = 0.9 (95% CI = 0.7-1.1)) but not as fast as those with ADRD (P < .01). The proportion of all beneficiaries who became long-stay or were readmitted to the hospital decreased (P < .05). The proportion with ADRD who became long-stay was nearly three times higher than those without throughout the study (15.0% vs 5.5% in 2007; 11.3% vs 4.3% in 2015).
CONCLUSION: Though disparity in ADRD in becoming long-stay residents remains, the increase in successful discharges among those with ADRD also stresses the increasing importance of community as a care setting for adults with ADRD.",J Am Geriatr Soc,2020
32296844,Elevated Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma N-Cadherin in Alzheimer Disease.,"N-cadherin is a synaptic adhesion molecule stabilizing synaptic cell structure and function. Cleavage of N-cadherin by γ-secretase produces a C-terminal fragment, which is increased in the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Here, we investigated the relationship between fluid N-cadherin levels and AD pathology. We first showed that the cleaved levels of N-cadherin were increased in homogenates of postmortem brain from AD patients compared with that in non-AD patients. We found that cleaved N-cadherin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were increased in AD dementia compared with that in healthy control. ELISA results revealed that plasma levels of N-cadherin in 76 patients with AD were higher than those in 133 healthy control subjects. The N-cadherin levels in the brains of an AD mouse model, APP Swedish/PS1delE9 Tg (APP Tg) were reduced compared with that in control. The N-terminal fragment of N-cadherin produced by cleavage at a plasma membrane was detected extravascularly, accumulated in senile plaques in the cortex of an APP Tg mouse. In addition, N-cadherin plasma levels were increased in APP Tg mice. Collectively, our study suggests that alteration of N-cadherin levels might be associated with AD pathology.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2020
33090226,Assessment of Rural-Urban Differences in Health Care Use and Survival Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementia.,"IMPORTANCE: There is poor understanding as to how survival and health care use varies among older adults living with Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) in rural vs urban areas of the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To describe survival and trajectories of hospital, hospice, nursing home, and home health care use among rural and urban Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD in the 6 years after diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study linked Medicare claims data from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2016, with nursing home and home health assessment data from all US counties. A total of 555 333 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries newly diagnosed with ADRD in 2010 were included. A total of 424 561 individuals (76.5%) resided in metropolitan counties, 75 001 (13.5%) in micropolitan counties, and 55 771 (10.0%) in rural counties.
EXPOSURES: Rurality of beneficiary's county of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of days survived after initial ADRD diagnosis; percent of survived days per month spent in the hospital, hospice nursing home, community with home health care services, and community without home health care services.
RESULTS: A total of 555 333 Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 82.0 [7.5] years; 345 294 women [62.2%]; 480 286 White [86.5%]) were evaluated. Compared with metropolitan county residents, rural beneficiaries were younger (mean [SD] age, 81.6 [7.6] vs 82.1 [7.5] years), were less likely to be women (34 100 [61.1%] vs 264 688 [62.3%]), were more likely to be White (50 886 [91.2%] vs 361 205 [85.1%]) and Medicaid-eligible (14 264 [25.6%] vs 71 656 [16.9%]), and had fewer preexisting chronic conditions (mean [SD], 6.9 [2.8] vs 7.4 [2.9]). Medicare beneficiaries residing in metropolitan counties survived a mean (SD) of 1183.5 (826.0) days after diagnosis. Adjusting for individual demographic and clinical characteristics, rural and micropolitan county residents survived approximately 1.5 months less than metropolitan residents. The adjusted share of survived days spent in nursing homes was 5.7 (95% CI, 4.0-7.5) percentage points higher for rural vs metropolitan residents. The adjusted share of days in hospitals was 0.7 (95% CI, -0.9 to -0.4) percentage points lower, and the share of days in community without home health care was 4.6 (95% CI, -6.1 to -3.1) percentage points lower for rural vs metropolitan county residents. There were no statistically significant differences in home health or hospice use. Similar patterns were found for micropolitan vs metropolitan residents as for rural vs metropolitan residents, although the magnitude of the differences were smaller. Differences in time spent in community and nursing homes between rural vs metropolitan beneficiaries became more pronounced with further time from diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study results suggest that, after diagnosis, rural Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD spend more time in nursing homes and less time in the community, receive less home health care, and have shorter survival than their urban counterparts.",JAMA Netw Open,2020
33213497,An in vitro bioengineered model of the human arterial neurovascular unit to study neurodegenerative diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: The neurovascular unit (NVU) - the interaction between the neurons and the cerebrovasculature - is increasingly important to interrogate through human-based experimental models. Although advanced models of cerebral capillaries have been developed in the last decade, there is currently no in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) perfusible model of the human cortical arterial NVU.
METHOD: We used a tissue-engineering technique to develop a scaffold-directed, perfusible, 3D human NVU that is cultured in native-like flow conditions that mimics the anatomy and physiology of cortical penetrating arteries.
RESULTS: This system, composed of primary human vascular cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and astrocytes) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons, demonstrates a physiological multilayer organization of the involved cell types. It reproduces key characteristics of cortical neurons and astrocytes and enables formation of a selective and functional endothelial barrier. We provide proof-of-principle data showing that this in vitro human arterial NVU may be suitable to study neurovascular components of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), as endogenously produced phosphorylated tau and beta-amyloid accumulate in the model over time. Finally, neuronal and glial fluid biomarkers relevant to neurodegenerative diseases are measurable in our arterial NVU model.
CONCLUSION: This model is a suitable research tool to investigate arterial NVU functions in healthy and disease states. Further, the design of the platform allows culture under native-like flow conditions for extended periods of time and yields sufficient tissue and media for downstream immunohistochemistry and biochemistry analyses.",Mol Neurodegener,2020
32488129,The human brain NGF metabolic pathway is impaired in the pre-clinical and clinical continuum of Alzheimers disease.,"The NGF metabolic pathway entails the proteins that mature pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) to NGF and those that degrade NGF. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons require NGF for maintenance of cholinergic phenotype, are critical for cognition, and degenerate early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, NGF metabolism is altered, but it is not known whether this is an early phenomenon, nor how it relates to AD pathology and symptomology. We acquired dorsolateral/medial prefrontal cortex samples from individuals with Alzheimer's dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or no cognitive impairment with high (HA-NCI) and low (LA-NCI) brain Aβ from the Religious Orders Study. Cortical proNGF protein, but not mRNA, was higher in AD, MCI, and HA-NCI, while mature NGF was lower. Plasminogen protein was higher in MCI and AD brain tissue, with plasminogen mRNA not likewise elevated, suggesting diminished activation of the proNGF convertase, plasmin. The plasminogen activator tPA was lower in HA-NCI while neuroserpin, the CNS tPA inhibitor, was higher in AD and MCI cortical samples. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which degrades NGF, was overactive in MCI and AD. Transcription of the MMP9 inhibitor TIMP1 was lower in HA-NCI. ProNGF levels correlated with plasminogen, neuroserpin, and VAChT while NGF correlated with MMP9 activity. In NCI, proNGF correlated with cerebral Aβ and tau deposition and to cognitive performance. In summary, proNGF maturation is impaired in preclinical and clinical AD while mature NGF degradation is enhanced. These differences correlate with cognition, pathology, and cholinergic tone, and may suggest novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Mol Psychiatry,2020

33328588,Hyperactivation of P2X7 receptors as a culprit of COVID-19 neuropathology.,"Scientists and health professionals are exhaustively trying to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by elucidating viral invasion mechanisms, possible drugs to prevent viral infection/replication, and health cares to minimize individual exposure. Although neurological symptoms are being reported worldwide, neural acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown. COVID-19 complications are associated with exacerbated immunoinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion. In this scenario, pro-inflammatory factors are intensely released into the bloodstream, causing the so-called ""cytokine storm"". Both pro-inflammatory factors and viruses may cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system, activating neuroinflammatory responses accompanied by hemorrhagic lesions and neuronal impairment, which are largely described processes in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger and/or worse brain diseases. Moreover, patients with central nervous system disorders associated to neuroimmune activation (e.g. depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) may present increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or achieve severe conditions. Elevated levels of extracellular ATP induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger hyperactivation of P2X7 receptors leading to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation as a key mediator of neuroinvasion and consequent neuroinflammatory processes, as observed in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, P2X7 receptor antagonism could be a promising strategy to prevent or treat neurological complications in COVID-19 patients.",Mol Psychiatry,2020
32591633,Amyloid-beta modulates the association between neurofilament light chain and brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Neurofilament light chain (NFL) measurement has been gaining strong support as a clinically useful neuronal injury biomarker for various neurodegenerative conditions. However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), its reflection on regional neuronal injury in the context of amyloid pathology remains unclear. This study included 83 cognitively normal (CN), 160 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 73 AD subjects who were further classified based on amyloid-beta (Aβ) status as positive or negative (Aβ+ vs Aβ-). In addition, 13 rats (5 wild type and 8 McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg)) were examined. In the clinical study, reduced precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal grey matter density were significantly associated with increased NFL concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+. Moreover, AD Aβ+ showed a significant association between the reduced grey matter density in the AD-vulnerable regions and increased NFL concentrations in CSF or plasma. Congruently, Tg rats recapitulated and validated the association between CSF NFL and grey matter density in the parietotemporal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus in the presence of amyloid pathology. In conclusion, reduced grey matter density and elevated NFL concentrations in CSF and plasma are associated in AD-vulnerable regions in the presence of amyloid positivity in the AD clinical spectrum and amyloid Tg rat model. These findings further support the NFL as a neuronal injury biomarker in the research framework of AD biomarker classification and for the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials.",Mol Psychiatry,2020
33037195,A versatile soluble siglec scaffold for sensitive and quantitative detection of glycan ligands.,"Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) are immunomodulatory receptors that are regulated by their glycan ligands. The connections between Siglecs and human disease motivate improved methods to detect Siglec ligands. Here, we describe a new versatile set of Siglec-Fc proteins for glycan ligand detection. Enhanced sensitivity and selectivity are enabled through multimerization and avoiding Fc receptors, respectively. Using these Siglec-Fc proteins, Siglec ligands are systematically profiled on healthy and cancerous cells and tissues, revealing many unique patterns. Additional features enable the production of small, homogenous Siglec fragments and development of a quantitative ligand-binding mass spectrometry assay. Using this assay, the ligand specificities of several Siglecs are clarified. For CD33 (Siglec-3), we demonstrate that it recognizes both α2-3 and α2-6 sialosides in solution and on cells, which has implications for its link to Alzheimer's disease susceptibility. These soluble Siglecs reveal the abundance of their glycan ligands on host cells as self-associated molecular patterns.",Nat Commun,2020
32968074,Risk prediction of late-onset Alzheimer's disease implies an oligogenic architecture.,"Genetic association studies have identified 44 common genome-wide significant risk loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, LOAD genetic architecture and prediction are unclear. Here we estimate the optimal P-threshold (P<sub>optimal</sub>) of a genetic risk score (GRS) for prediction of LOAD in three independent datasets comprising 676 cases and 35,675 family history proxy cases. We show that the discriminative ability of GRS in LOAD prediction is maximised when selecting a small number of SNPs. Both simulation results and direct estimation indicate that the number of causal common SNPs for LOAD may be less than 100, suggesting LOAD is more oligogenic than polygenic. The best GRS explains approximately 75% of SNP-heritability, and individuals in the top decile of GRS have ten-fold increased odds when compared to those in the bottom decile. In addition, 14 variants are identified that contribute to both LOAD risk and age at onset of LOAD.",Nat Commun,2020
32826893,A single-cell atlas of the human substantia nigra reveals cell-specific pathways associated with neurological disorders.,"We describe a human single-nuclei transcriptomic atlas for the substantia nigra (SN), generated by sequencing approximately 17,000 nuclei from matched cortical and SN samples. We show that the common genetic risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with dopaminergic neuron (DaN)-specific gene expression, including mitochondrial functioning, protein folding and ubiquitination pathways. We identify a distinct cell type association between PD risk and oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression. Unlike Alzheimer's disease (AD), we find no association between PD risk and microglia or astrocytes, suggesting that neuroinflammation plays a less causal role in PD than AD. Beyond PD, we find associations between SN DaNs and GABAergic neuron gene expression and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Conditional analysis reveals that distinct neuropsychiatric disorders associate with distinct sets of neuron-specific genes but converge onto shared loci within oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors. This atlas guides our aetiological understanding by associating SN cell type expression profiles with specific disease risk.",Nat Commun,2020
33139712,APOE4 exacerbates synapse loss and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease patient iPSC-derived cerebral organoids.,"APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the underlying mechanism, we develop cerebral organoid models using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with APOE ε3/ε3 or ε4/ε4 genotype from individuals with either normal cognition or AD dementia. Cerebral organoids from AD patients carrying APOE ε4/ε4 show greater apoptosis and decreased synaptic integrity. While AD patient-derived cerebral organoids have increased levels of Aβ and phosphorylated tau compared to healthy subject-derived cerebral organoids, APOE4 exacerbates tau pathology in both healthy subject-derived and AD patient-derived organoids. Transcriptomics analysis by RNA-sequencing reveals that cerebral organoids from AD patients are associated with an enhancement of stress granules and disrupted RNA metabolism. Importantly, isogenic conversion of APOE4 to APOE3 attenuates the APOE4-related phenotypes in cerebral organoids from AD patients. Together, our study using human iPSC-organoids recapitulates APOE4-related phenotypes and suggests APOE4-related degenerative pathways contributing to AD pathogenesis.",Nat Commun,2020

A few key cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have been robustly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Several novel biomarkers are very promising, especially blood-based markers. However, many biomarker findings have had low reproducibility despite initial promising results. In this perspective, we identify possible sources for low reproducibility of studies on fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. We suggest guidelines for researchers and journal editors, with the aim to improve reproducibility of findings.",Nat Commun,2020

33461049,Associations between brain amyloid accumulation and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers.,"Some studies suggest that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) may protect against memory decline more than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), but few have examined possible mechanisms. We assessed longitudinal differences between ARB versus ACE-I users in global and sub-regional amyloid-β accumulation by <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir. In cognitively normal older adults (n= 142), propensity-weighted linear mixed-effects models showed that ARB versus ACE-I use was associated with slower amyloid-β accumulation in the cortex, and specifically in the caudal anterior cingulate and precuneus, and in the precentral and postcentral gyri. In amyloid-positive participants with Alzheimer's disease dementia or mild cognitive impairment (n = 169), ARB versus ACE-I use was not associated with different rates of amyloid-β accumulation. Apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status explained some heterogeneity in the different rates of amyloid-β accumulation between users of ARBs versus ACE-Is in the study. Replicative studies and clinical trials are warranted to confirm potential benefits of ARBs on rates of amyloid-β accumulation in the contexts of Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment.",Neurobiol Aging,2020
33477009,Association of enlarged perivascular spaces with Aβ and tau deposition in cognitively normal older population.,"The relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and Aβ and tau deposition is poorly investigated in cognitively normal older population. In our study, a total of 106 cognitively normal older subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were included. All the subjects underwent brain MRI, florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET), and flortaucipir PET examinations. EPVS were rated on MRI using a 5-point scale in the basal ganglia (BG-EPVS) and the centrum semiovale (CSO-EPVS). Our study revealed that 43 subjects had high-degree BG-EPVS (degree >1) and 58 subjects had high-degree CSO-EPVS (degree >1). In logistic regression, high degree of BG-EPVS was associated with age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.16) and severe deep white matter hyperintensity (OR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.12-6.35). High degree of CSO-EPVS was associated with flortaucipir PET positivity (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.02-4.93). In conclusion, high degree of CSO-EPVS was associated with tau deposition in the brain, whereas high degree of BG-EPVS was associated with age and severe deep white matter hyperintensity, a marker of small vessel disease.",Neurobiol Aging,2020
33338617,Analyzing the effect of APOE on Alzheimer's disease progression using an event-based model for stratified populations.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is phenotypically heterogeneous. APOE is a triallelic gene which correlates with phenotypic heterogeneity in AD. In this work, we determined the effect of APOE alleles on the disease progression timeline of AD using a discriminative event-based model (DEBM). Since DEBM is a data-driven model, stratification into smaller disease subgroups would lead to more inaccurate models as compared to fitting the model on the entire dataset. Hence our secondary aim is to propose and evaluate novel approaches in which we split the different steps of DEBM into group-aspecific and group-specific parts, where the entire dataset is used to train the group-aspecific parts and only the data from a specific group is used to train the group-specific parts of the DEBM. We performed simulation experiments to benchmark the accuracy of the proposed approaches and to select the optimal approach. Subsequently, the chosen approach was applied to the baseline data of 417 cognitively normal, 235 mild cognitively impaired who convert to AD within 3 years, and 342 AD patients from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to gain new insights into the effect of APOE carriership on the disease progression timeline of AD. In the ε4 carrier group, the model predicted with high confidence that CSF Amyloidβ<sub>42</sub> and the cognitive score of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) are early biomarkers. Hippocampus was the earliest volumetric biomarker to become abnormal, closely followed by the CSF Phosphorylated Tau<sub>181</sub> (PTAU) biomarker. In the homozygous ε3 carrier group, the model predicted a similar ordering among CSF biomarkers. However, the volume of the fusiform gyrus was identified as one of the earliest volumetric biomarker. While the findings in the ε4 carrier and the homozygous ε3 carrier groups fit the current understanding of progression of AD, the finding in the ε2 carrier group did not. The model predicted, with relatively low confidence, CSF Neurogranin as one of the earliest biomarkers along with cognitive score of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Amyloid β<sub>42</sub> was found to become abnormal after PTAU. The presented models could aid understanding of the disease, and in selecting homogeneous group of presymptomatic subjects at-risk of developing symptoms for clinical trials.",Neuroimage,2020
33134515,Association of blood-based transcriptional risk scores with biomarkers for Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether transcriptional risk scores (TRSs), a summation of polarized expression levels of functional genes, reflect the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: Blood transcriptome data were from Caucasian participants, which included AD, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal controls (CN) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 661) and AddNeuroMed (n = 674) cohorts. To calculate TRSs, we selected functional genes that were expressed under the control of the AD risk loci and were identified as being responsible for AD by using Bayesian colocalization and mendelian randomization methods. Regression was used to investigate the association of the TRS with diagnosis (AD vs CN) and MRI biomarkers (entorhinal thickness and hippocampal volume). Regression was also used to evaluate whether expression of each functional gene was associated with AD diagnosis.
RESULTS: The TRS was significantly associated with AD diagnosis, hippocampal volume, and entorhinal cortical thickness in the ADNI. The association of the TRS with AD diagnosis and entorhinal cortical thickness was also replicated in AddNeuroMed. Among functional genes identified to calculate the TRS, CD33 and PILRA were significantly upregulated, and TRAPPC6A was significantly downregulated in patients with AD compared with CN, all of which were identified in the ADNI and replicated in AddNeuroMed.
CONCLUSIONS: The blood-based TRS is significantly associated with AD diagnosis and neuroimaging biomarkers. In blood, CD33 and PILRA were known to be associated with uptake of β-amyloid and herpes simplex virus 1 infection, respectively, both of which may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: The study is rated Class III because of the case control design and the risk of spectrum bias.",Neurol Genet,2020

32926328,5-N-ethyl Carboxamidoadenosine Stimulates Adenosine-2b Receptor-Mediated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway to Improve Brain Mitochondrial Function in Amyloid Beta-Induced Cognitive Deficit Mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with loss in memory as one of the cardinal features. 5-N-ethyl carboxamidoadenosine (NECA), an agonist of adenosine-2b receptor, exerts neuroprotective activity against several experimental conditions. Further, NECA activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and also attenuates mitochondrial toxicity in mammalian tissues other than brain. Moreover, there is no report on the role of A2b/MAPK-mediated signaling pathway in Aβ-induced mitochondrial toxicity in the brain of the experimental animals. Therefore, the present study evaluated the neuroprotective activity of NECA with or without MAPK inhibitor against Aβ-induced cognitive deficit and mitochondrial toxicity in the experimental rodents. Further, the effect of NECA with or without MAPK inhibitor was evaluated on Aβ-induced mitochondrial toxicity in the memory-sensitive mice brain regions. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ 1-42 was injected to healthy male mice through Hamilton syringe via polyethylene tube to induce AD-like behavioral manifestations. NECA attenuated Aβ-induced cognitive impairments in the rodents. In addition, NECA ameliorated Aβ-induced Aβ accumulation and cholinergic dysfunction in the selected memory-sensitive mouse HIP, PFC, and AMY. Further, NECA significantly attenuated Aβ-induced mitochondrial toxicity in terms of decrease in the mitochondrial function, integrity, and bioenergetics in the brain regions of these animals. However, MAPKI diminished the therapeutic effects of NECA on behavioral, biochemical, and molecular observations in AD-like animals. Therefore, it can be speculated that NECA exhibits neuroprotective activity perhaps through MAPK activation in AD-like rodents. Moreover, A2b-mediated MAPK activation could be a promising target in the management of AD.",Neuromolecular Med,2020
33238137,"Transformative Network Modeling of Multi-omics Data Reveals Detailed Circuits, Key Regulators, and Potential Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease.","To identify the molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), we performed an integrative network analysis of multi-omics profiling of four cortical areas across 364 donors with varying cognitive and neuropathological phenotypes. Our analyses revealed thousands of molecular changes and uncovered neuronal gene subnetworks as the most dysregulated in LOAD. ATP6V1A was identified as a key regulator of a top-ranked neuronal subnetwork, and its role in disease-related processes was evaluated through CRISPR-based manipulation in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and RNAi-based knockdown in Drosophila models. Neuronal impairment and neurodegeneration caused by ATP6V1A deficit were improved by a repositioned compound, NCH-51. This study provides not only a global landscape but also detailed signaling circuits of complex molecular interactions in key brain regions affected by LOAD, and the resulting network models will serve as a blueprint for developing next-generation therapeutic agents against LOAD.",Neuron,2020
32012164,Tensor decomposition of stimulated monocyte and macrophage gene expression profiles identifies neurodegenerative disease-specific trans-eQTLs.,"Recent human genetic studies suggest that cells of the innate immune system have a primary role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the results from these studies often do not elucidate how the genetic variants affect the biology of these cells to modulate disease risk. Here, we applied a tensor decomposition method to uncover disease associated gene networks linked to distal genetic variation in stimulated human monocyte and macrophage gene expression profiles. We report robust evidence that some disease associated genetic variants affect the expression of multiple genes in trans. These include a Parkinson's disease locus influencing the expression of genes mediated by a protease that controls lysosomal function, and Alzheimer's disease loci influencing the expression of genes involved in type 1 interferon signaling, myeloid phagocytosis, and complement cascade pathways. Overall, we uncover gene networks in induced innate immune cells linked to disease associated genetic variants, which may help elucidate the underlying biology of disease.",PLoS Genet,2020
33152005,The association of clinical phenotypes to known AD/FTD genetic risk loci and their inter-relationship.,"To elucidate how variants in genetic risk loci previously implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) contribute to expression of disease phenotypes, a phenome-wide association study was performed in two waves. In the first wave, we explored clinical traits associated with thirteen genetic variants previously reported to be linked to disease risk using both the 23andMe and UKB cohorts. We tested 30 additional AD variants in UKB cohort only in the second wave. APOE variants defining ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles and rs646776 were identified to be significantly associated with metabolic/cardiovascular and longevity traits. APOE variants were also significantly associated with neurological traits. ABI3 variant rs28394864 was significantly associated with cardiovascular (e.g. (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, angina) and immune-related trait asthma. Both APOE variants and CLU variant were significantly associated with nearsightedness. HLA- DRB1 variant was associated with diseases with immune-related traits. Additionally, variants from 10+ AD genes (BZRAP1-AS1, ADAMTS4, ADAM10, APH1B, SCIMP, ABI3, SPPL2A, ZNF232, GRN, CD2AP, and CD33) were associated with hematological measurements such as white blood cell (leukocyte) count, monocyte count, neutrophill count, platelet count, and/or mean platelet (thrombocyte) volume (an autoimmune disease biomarker). Many of these genes are expressed specifically in microglia. The associations of ABI3 variant with cardiovascular and immune-related traits are one of the novel findings from this study. Taken together, it is evidenced that at least some AD and FTD variants are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes and not just dementia. These findings were discussed in the context of causal relationship versus pleiotropy via Mendelian randomization analysis.",PLoS One,2020
33119615,G82S RAGE polymorphism influences amyloid-RAGE interactions relevant in Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease(AD) due to its ability to bind amyloid-beta (Aβ42) and mediate inflammatory response. G82S RAGE polymorphism is associated with AD but the molecular mechanism for this association is not understood. Our previous in silico study indicated a higher binding affinity for mutated G82S RAGE, which could be caused due to changes in N linked glycosylation at residue N81. To confirm this hypothesis, in the present study molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to simulate the wild type (WT) and G82S glycosylated structures of RAGE to identify the global structural changes and to find the binding efficiency with Aβ42 peptide. Binding pocket analysis of the MD trajectory showed that cavity/binding pocket in mutant G82S glycosylated RAGE variants is more exposed and accessible to external ligands compared to WT RAGE, which can enhance the affinity of RAGE for Aβ. To validate the above concept, an in vitro binding study was carried using SHSY5Y cell line expressing recombinant WT and mutated RAGE variant individually to which HiLyte Fluor labeled Aβ42 was incubated at different concentrations. Saturated binding kinetics method was adopted to determine the Kd values for Aβ42 binding to RAGE. The Kd value for Aβ42- WT and Aβ42-mutant RAGE binding were 92±40 nM (95% CI-52 to 152nM; R2-0.92) and 45±20 nM (95% CI -29 to 64nM; R2-0.93), respectively. The Kd value of <100nM observed for both variants implicates RAGE as a high-affinity receptor for Aβ42 and mutant RAGE has higher affinity compared to WT. The alteration in binding affinity is responsible for activation of the inflammatory pathway as implicated by enhanced expression of TNFα and IL6 in mutant RAGE expressing cell line which gives a mechanistic view for the G82S RAGE association with AD.",PLoS One,2020
33370284,The protective mutation A673T in amyloid precursor protein gene decreases Aβ peptides production for 14 forms of Familial Alzheimer's Disease in SH-SY5Y cells.,"The deposition of Aβ plaques in the brain leads to the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease. The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by α-secretase (non-amyloidogenic processing of APP), however increased cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) leads to the accumulation of Aβ peptides, which forms plaques. APP mutations mapping to exons 16 and 17 favor plaque accumulation and cause Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). However, a variant of the APP gene (A673T) originally found in an Icelandic population reduces BACE1 cleavage by 40%. A series of plasmids containing the APP gene, each with one of 29 different FAD mutations mapping to exon 16 and exon 17 was created. These plasmids were then replicated with the addition of the A673T mutation. Combined these formed the library of plasmids that was used in this study. The plasmids were transfected in neuroblastomas to assess the effect of this mutation on Aβ peptide production. The production of Aβ peptides was decreased for some FAD mutations due to the presence of the co-dominant A673T mutation. The reduction of Aβ peptide concentrations for the London mutation (V717I) even reached the same level as for A673T control in SH-SY5Y cells. These preliminary results suggest that the insertion of A673T in APP genes containing FAD mutations might confer a clinical benefit in preventing or delaying the onset of some FADs.",PLoS One,2020

33246962,Patient-centered connectivity-based prediction of tau pathology spread in Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the Braak staging scheme suggests a stereotypical tau spreading pattern that does, however, not capture interindividual variability in tau deposition. This complicates the prediction of tau spreading, which may become critical for defining individualized tau-PET readouts in clinical trials. Since tau is assumed to spread throughout connected regions, we used functional connectivity to improve tau spreading predictions over Braak staging methods. We included two samples with longitudinal tau-PET from controls and AD patients. Cross-sectionally, we found connectivity of tau epicenters (i.e., regions with earliest tau) to predict estimated tau spreading sequences. Longitudinally, we found tau accumulation rates to correlate with connectivity strength to patient-specific tau epicenters. A connectivity-based, patient-centered tau spreading model improved the assessment of tau accumulation rates compared to Braak stage-specific readouts and reduced sample sizes by ~40% in simulated tau-targeting interventions. Thus, connectivity-based tau spreading models may show utility in clinical trials.",Sci Adv,2020
32985496,Global quantitative analysis of the human brain proteome and phosphoproteome in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an early, asymptomatic phase (AsymAD) in which individuals exhibit amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation in the absence of clinically detectable cognitive decline. Here we report an unbiased multiplex quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis using tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling of human post-mortem cortex (n = 27) across pathology-free controls, AsymAD and symptomatic AD individuals. With off-line high-pH fractionation and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer, we identified 11,378 protein groups across three TMT 11-plex batches. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to enrich for phosphopeptides from the same TMT-labeled cases and 51,736 phosphopeptides were identified. Of these, 48,992 were quantified by TMT reporter ions representing 33,652 unique phosphosites. Two reference standards in each TMT 11-plex were included to assess intra- and inter-batch variance at the protein and peptide level. This comprehensive human brain proteome and phosphoproteome dataset will serve as a valuable resource for the identification of biochemical, cellular and signaling pathways altered during AD progression.",Sci Data,2020
33335244,Identification of Alzheimer's disease using a convolutional neural network model based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.,"The classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using deep learning methods has shown promising results, but successful application in clinical settings requires a combination of high accuracy, short processing time, and generalizability to various populations. In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD classification algorithm using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from AD patients and age/gender-matched cognitively normal controls from two populations that differ in ethnicity and education level. These populations come from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each population, we trained CNNs on five subsets using coronal slices of T1-weighted images that cover the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated the models on validation subsets from both the same population (within-dataset validation) and other population (between-dataset validation). Our models achieved average areas under the curves of 0.91-0.94 for within-dataset validation and 0.88-0.89 for between-dataset validation. The mean processing time per person was 23-24 s. The within-dataset and between-dataset performances were comparable between the ADNI-derived and SNUBH-derived models. These results demonstrate the generalizability of our models to different patients with different ethnicities and education levels, as well as their potential for deployment as fast and accurate diagnostic support tools for AD.",Sci Rep,2020

34874463,Dysregulated coordination of MAPT exon 2 and exon 10 splicing underlies different tau pathologies in PSP and AD.,"Understanding regulation of MAPT splicing is important to the etiology of many nerurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), in which different tau isoforms accumulate in pathologic inclusions. MAPT, the gene encoding the tau protein, undergoes complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing to generate six isoforms. Tauopathies can be categorized by the presence of tau aggregates containing either 3 (3R) or 4 (4R) microtubule-binding domain repeats (determined by inclusion/exclusion of exon 10), but the role of the N-terminal domain of the protein, determined by inclusion/exclusion of exons 2 and 3 has been less well studied. Using a correlational screen in human brain tissue, we observed coordination of MAPT exons 2 and 10 splicing. Expressions of exon 2 splicing regulators and subsequently exon 2 inclusion are differentially disrupted in PSP and AD brain, resulting in the accumulation of 1N4R isoforms in PSP and 0N isoforms in AD temporal cortex. Furthermore, we identified different N-terminal isoforms of tau present in neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites and tufted astrocytes, indicating a role for differential N-terminal splicing in the development of disparate tau neuropathologies. We conclude that N-terminal splicing and combinatorial regulation with exon 10 inclusion/exclusion is likely to be important to our understanding of tauopathies.",Acta Neuropathol,2021
34727983,P62 accumulates through neuroanatomical circuits in response to tauopathy propagation.,"In Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, trans-synaptic transfer and accumulation of pathological tau from donor to recipient neurons is thought to contribute to disease progression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using complementary in vivo and in vitro models, we examined the relationship between these two processes and neuronal clearance. Accumulation of p62 (a marker of defective protein clearance) correlated with pathological tau accumulation in two mouse models of tauopathy spread; Entorhinal Cortex-tau (EC-Tau) mice where tau pathology progresses in time from EC to other brain regions, and PS19 mice injected with tau seeds. In both models and in several brain regions, p62 colocalized with human tau in a pathological conformation (MC1 antibody). In EC-Tau mice, p62 accumulated before overt tau pathology had developed and was associated with the presence of aggregation-competent tau seeds identified using a FRET-based assay. Furthermore, p62 accumulated in the cytoplasm of neurons in the dentate gyrus of EC-Tau mice prior to the appearance of MC1 positive tauopathy. However, MC1 positive tau was shown to be present at the synapse and to colocalize with p62 as shown by immuno electron microscopy. In vitro, p62 colocalized with tau inclusions in two primary cortical neuron models of tau pathology. In a three-chamber microfluidic device containing neurons overexpressing fluorescent tau, seeding of tau in the donor chamber led to tau pathology spread and p62 accumulation in both the donor and the recipient chamber. Overall, these data are in accordance with the hypothesis that the accumulation and trans-synaptic spread of pathological tau disrupts clearance mechanisms, preceding the appearance of obvious tau aggregation. A vicious cycle of tau accumulation and clearance deficit would be expected to feed-forward and exacerbate disease progression across neuronal circuits in human tauopathies.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2021
34635189,Anatomic survey of seeding in Alzheimer's disease brains reveals unexpected patterns.,"Tauopathies are heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases defined by progressive brain accumulation of tau aggregates. The most common tauopathy, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), involves progressive tau deposition that can be divided into specific stages of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. This classification is consistent with experimental data which suggests that network-based propagation is mediated by cell-cell transfer of tau ""seeds"", or assemblies, that serve as templates for their own replication. Until now, seeding assays of AD brain have largely been limited to areas previously defined by NFT pathology. We now expand this work to additional regions. We selected 20 individuals with AD pathology of NFT stages I, III, and V. We stained and classified 25 brain regions in each using the anti-phospho-tau monoclonal antibody AT8. We measured tau seeding in each of the 500 samples using a cell-based tau ""biosensor"" assay in which induction of intracellular tau aggregation is mediated by exogenous tau assemblies. We observed a progressive increase in tau seeding according to NFT stage. Seeding frequently preceded NFT pathology, e.g., in the basolateral subnucleus of the amygdala and the substantia nigra, pars compacta. We observed seeding in brain regions not previously known to develop tau pathology, e.g., the globus pallidus and internal capsule, where AT8 staining revealed mainly axonal accumulation of tau. AT8 staining in brain regions identified because of tau seeding also revealed pathology in a previously undescribed cell type: Bergmann glia of the cerebellar cortex. We also detected tau seeding in brain regions not previously examined, e.g., the intermediate reticular zone, dorsal raphe nucleus, amygdala, basal nucleus of Meynert, and olfactory bulb. In conclusion, tau histopathology and seeding are complementary analytical tools. Tau seeding assays reveal pathology in the absence of AT8 signal in some instances, and previously unrecognized sites of tau deposition. The variation in sites of seeding between individuals could underlie differences in the clinical presentation and course of AD.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2021
34625123,TNF-mediated neuroinflammation is linked to neuronal necroptosis in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus.,"The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying neuronal death and dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. However, chronic neuroinflammation has been implicated in stimulating or exacerbating neuronal damage. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of cytokines are involved in many systemic chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions and are amongst the key mediators of neuroinflammation. TNF binds to the TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors to activate diverse cellular responses that can be either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative. In particular, TNF can induce programmed necrosis or necroptosis in an inflammatory environment. Although activation of necroptosis has recently been demonstrated in the AD brain, its significance in AD neuron loss and the role of TNF signaling is unclear. We demonstrate an increase in expression of multiple proteins in the TNF/TNF receptor-1-mediated necroptosis pathway in the AD post-mortem brain, as indicated by the phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, predominantly observed in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. The density of phosphoRIPK3 + and phosphoMLKL + neurons correlated inversely with total neuron density and showed significant sexual dimorphism within the AD cohort. In addition, apoptotic signaling was not significantly activated in the AD brain compared to the control brain. Exposure of human iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons to TNF increased necroptotic cell death when apoptosis was inhibited, which was significantly reversed by small molecule inhibitors of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. In the post-mortem AD brain and in human iPSC neurons, in response to TNF, we show evidence of altered expression of proteins of the ESCRT III complex, which has been recently suggested as an antagonist of necroptosis and a possible mechanism by which cells can survive after necroptosis has been triggered. Taken together, our results suggest that neuronal loss in AD is due to TNF-mediated necroptosis rather than apoptosis, which is amenable to therapeutic intervention at several points in the signaling pathway.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2021
34751671,Alteration of mitochondrial homeostasis is an early event in a C. elegans model of human tauopathy.,"Tauopathies are a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of insoluble intracellular tau filaments in the brain. Evidence suggests that there is a tight connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. However, whether mitochondrial dysfunction occurs prior to the detection of tau aggregates in tauopathies remains elusive. Here, we utilized transgenic nematodes expressing the full length of wild type tau in neuronal cells and monitored mitochondrial morphology alterations over time. Although tau-expressing nematodes did not accumulate detectable levels of tau aggregates during larval stages, they displayed increased mitochondrial damage and locomotion defects compared to the control worms. Chelating calcium restored mitochondrial activity and improved motility in the tau-expressing larvae suggesting a link between mitochondrial damage, calcium homeostasis and neuronal impairment in these animals. Our findings suggest that defective mitochondrial function is an early pathogenic event of tauopathies, taking place before tau aggregation and undermining neuronal homeostasis and organismal fitness. Understanding the molecular mechanisms causing mitochondrial dysfunction early in tauopathy will be of significant clinical and therapeutic value and merits further investigation.",Aging (Albany NY),2021
34432674,Effects of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) on Cognitive Impairment in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Disease: A Meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the beneficial effects and optimal stimulation protocol of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched until March 2020. The cognitive outcomes were extracted and the standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval was calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. The result of NIBS showed significant effect on global cognition (P<0.05). Low-frequency rTMS over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) over left DLPFC, and the tDCS over left DLPFC and temporal lobe can significantly improve the memory function (P<0.05). HF-rTMS over left, right, or bilateral DLPFC can significantly improve the language function (P<0.05). Both HF-rTMS and tDCS over left DLPFC can obviously improve the executive function (P<0.05). Multiple sessions of rTMS with 80% to 100% intensity and anode tDCS with 2 mA current density are more suitable for all these functions.
CONCLUSIONS: NIBS has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease patients. Distinct optimal stimulation parameters were observed for different cognitive functions.",Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,2021
34873815,Differential expression of tau species and the association with cognitive decline and synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease.,"Pathological tau proteins in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) mainly accumulate in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs). However, the molecular properties of tau species present in NFTs and NPs are not known. We tested the hypothesis that tau species within NFT-predominant tissue (NFT_AD) are distinct and more toxic than those in NP-predominant tissue (NP_AD). We analyzed the tau species from post mortem prefrontal cortical brains of NFT_AD and NP_AD. Compared to NP_AD, NFT_AD displayed highly phosphorylated tau oligomers, possessed tau oligomers in extracellular vesicles, and the 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) isoforms were differentially expressed between the groups. Comparison of tau proteins isolated from NFT- versus NP-AD subjects demonstrated higher tau seeding activity in NFT subjects and a greater degree of inducing synaptic loss in cultured neurons. We propose that tau species from NFT-predominant tissues possess greater levels of degenerative properties, thereby causing synaptic loss and cognitive decline.",Alzheimers Dement,2021
34855281,What can 7T sodium MRI tell us about cellular energy depletion and neurotransmission in Alzheimer's disease?,"The pathophysiological processes underlying the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the neuronal level are still unclear. Previous research has hinted at metabolic energy deficits and altered sodium homeostasis with impaired neuronal function as a potential metabolic marker relevant for neurotransmission in AD. Using sodium (<sup>23</sup> Na) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging on an ultra-high-field 7 Tesla MR scanner, we found increased cerebral tissue sodium concentration (TSC) in 17 biomarker-defined AD patients compared to 22 age-matched control subjects in vivo. TSC was highly discriminative between controls and early AD stages and was predictive for cognitive state, and associated with regional tau load assessed with flortaucipir-positron emission tomography as a possible mediator of TSC-associated neurodegeneration. TSC could therefore serve as a non-invasive, stage-dependent, metabolic imaging marker. Setting a focus on cellular metabolism and potentially disturbed interneuronal communication due to energy-dependent altered cell homeostasis could hamper progressive cognitive decline by targeting these processes in future interventions.",Alzheimers Dement,2021
34971109,Feasibility and evaluation of the Dementia Engagement Modelling Program (DEMP): a novel model of aged care during COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the quality of life of aged care residents living with dementia (RLWD). Lockdown measures necessary to protect RLWD and caring staff from COVID-19 have resulted in increased social isolation, loneliness, and behaviors and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In response, the Australian Government funded a pilot program, the Dementia Engagement Modelling Program (DEMP) as part of the Aged Care COVID-19 Grief and Trauma support package for RLWD, their families and aged care staff. Operated by the Dementia Centre of HammondCare, the DEMP provides first-line multimodal external support for RLWD at a greater risk of developing BPSD due to COVID-19 restrictions. This study aims to describe the DEMP and evaluate its feasibility and outcomes for Australian RLWD.
METHODS: A team of 10 trained DEMP consultants was involved in delivering a consultancy service that modelled best practice and person-centred activities of engagement to support staff in providing residents with meaningful purpose, comfort, and reassurance. Consultants also provided coaching and development opportunities for staff to enhance their knowledge regarding communication and engagement. Outcome measures included the regular administration of the Engagement in Preferred ActivitieS Scale (EPASS; ≥4-9 moderate-to-high engagement). A phone evaluation survey for supported residential aged care homes (RACHs) was conducted to determine the feasibility of DEMP.
RESULTS: A total of 60 residents (86.0 ± 7.8 y; 68% female) across 10 RACHs from three Australian states (VIC, NSW, QLD) was supported by DEMP between May and July 2021. More than half of the residents had Alzheimer's disease (n = 24, 40%) and vascular dementia (n = 7, 12%). Completed EPASS assessments (n = 389) demonstrated that the vast majority (64%-72%) of residents scored moderate-to-high engagement. All supported RACHs highly recommended the DEMP to other colleagues and rated the program highly for implementation feasibility including the recommended engagement activities/brokered items.
CONCLUSIONS: The DEMP is a novel, feasible and effective dementia-specific engagement modelling program for Australian RLWD in the era of COVID-19 pandemic.",Alzheimers Dement,2021
34971052,Leveraging virtual reality to train certified nursing assistants as essential dementia-care personnel in the age of COVID-19.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has placed an extraordinary and disproportionate level of responsibility and risk on certified nursing assistants (CNAs) caring for persons with dementia (PWD) relative to their training, resources, and compensation levels. Nearly one-quarter of COVID-19 deaths in the United States have been nursing home residents and staff. Despite providing the majority of direct care, CNAs are amongst the most under-resourced and under-trained frontline workers. Given their essentiality, it is critical to support CNAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this work is to provide CNAs with a space to strengthen their knowledge and confidence in caring for PWD. This pilot study applies a virtual reality (VR) curriculum to train CNAs regarding the lived experiences of PWD and their loved ones. The VR vignette portrays a Latinx woman, Beatriz, through progressive stages of Alzheimer's disease.
METHOD: Chicago Methodist Senior Services (CMSS) CNAs were recruited (N=7; 86% female, 86% Black) for a seven-week online training program consisting of 1.5 hours per week. Each class included a didactic lecture and an Embodied Labs VR module depicting a first-person experience of dementia through a distributive model approach. The program concluded with two recorded focus groups. Participants completed the UCLA Geriatric Attitudes Scale, a dementia knowledge assessment, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index surveys, and a COVID-19 Impact questionnaire. Current analyses include qualitative content analysis for focus group data and descriptive, quantitative statistics for pre-and post-VR intervention surveys.
RESULT: Preliminary results demonstrate that CNAs endorsed a positive change in attitudes toward older adults (p=0.069), a deepened understanding of dementia, and increased confidence in caregiving skills. Focus groups allowed CNAs to discuss changes in resident behavior and support one another through a virtual platform during a global pandemic.
CONCLUSION: Combining traditional didactic lectures with VR-based curricula provided CNAs with foundational knowledge and first-hand experience of dementia pathology. Participants reported greater levels of insight and empathy for PWD. Future aims include expansion of training content to include end-of-life conversations, LGBTQIA aging, and Lewy body dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2021
34971285,Effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: A randomised controlled study.,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessity that rehabilitation services are provided remotely to patients. These process required a transformation in healthcare. The aim of this study was investigate the effectiveness of the home-based online supervised exercise program in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the results of real-time supervised physical exercise telerehabilitation program in AD.
METHOD: Eighteen subjects with early-middle stage of AD were randomised into 2 group as telerehabilitation group (TG; mean age: 77.7 ± 5.29 years; 7 Female, 3 Male) and control group (CG; mean age: 78.5 ± 7.07 years; 5 Female, 3 Male). Our primary outcome was Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), seconder outcomes were Timed Up&Go (TUG), One-leg Balance Test (OLBT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS). The 6-week motor-cognitive dual-task exercise training was performed online and under the supervision of physiotherapist through videoconference. No physical or cognitive intervention was applied to the control group for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed before and after the treatment. In statistical analysis, the change in the outcome scores was calculated (∆ = last measurement-first measurement), the difference between the groups was performed with the Mann Whitney-U Test in SPSS 22.0. Trial's protocol is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT04606251.
RESULT: There was a significant difference between TG and CG in favor of TG in MMSE, TUG, FIM and GDS (p<0,05); There was no significant difference between groups in OLBT (p>0,05). Statistical results have been showed in Table 1. No safety problem was observed during the treatment. All subjects were completed the study, there was a high adherence to treatment.
CONCLUSION: Physical exercise treatment with telerehabilitation was feasible, safe and well-accepted by people with early-middle stage of AD. Online-supervised exercise program can improve cognitive function, functional mobility, independence and reduce depressive symptoms.",Alzheimers Dement,2021
34568539,Routine magnetoencephalography in memory clinic patients: A machine learning approach.,"INTRODUCTION: We report the routine application of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a memory clinic, and its value in the discrimination of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from controls.
METHODS: Three hundred sixty-six patients visiting our memory clinic underwent MEG recording. Source-reconstructed MEG data were visually assessed and evaluated in the context of clinical findings and other diagnostic markers. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of MEG spectral measures in the discrimination of individual AD dementia patients (n = 40) from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients (n = 40) using random forest models.
RESULTS: Best discrimination was obtained using a combination of relative theta and delta power (accuracy 0.846, sensitivity 0.855, specificity 0.837). The results were validated in an independent cohort. Hippocampal and thalamic regions, besides temporal-occipital lobes, contributed considerably to the model.
DISCUSSION: MEG has been implemented successfully in the workup of memory clinic patients and has value in diagnostic decision-making.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34541290,Quantification of cognitive impairment to characterize heterogeneity of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychological test scores are limited and standard outcomes may mask the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment. This article presents the calculation and evaluation of six composite scores that quantify domain-specific impairment.
METHODS: Parameters for composite scores calculation were learned by performing confirmatory factor analysis in a sample of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The obtained scores were evaluated with a separate sample of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in two automated tasks: unsupervised partition in different subgroups and prediction of progression to dementia for different time windows.
RESULTS: MCI subgroups with distinctive cognitive profiles and risk of progression emerged from cluster analysis. Composite scores outperform standard neuropsychological tests when automatically predicting progression within time windows up to 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Domain-specific composite scores are useful to delineate profiles of impairment, stratify the MCI risk, and predict progression to dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34458552,Association of walking energetics with amyloid beta status: Findings from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.,"INTRODUCTION: Higher energetic costs for mobility predict gait speed decline. Slow gait is linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether the energetic cost of walking is linked to AD pathology is unknown. We investigated the cross-sectional association between the energetic cost of walking, gait speed, and amyloid beta (Aβ) status (+/-) in older adults.
METHODS: One hundred forty-nine cognitively normal adults (56% women, mean age 77.5 ± 8.4 years) completed customary-paced walking assessments with indirect calorimetry and <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. Logistic regression models examined associations adjusted for demographics, body composition, comorbid conditions, and apolipoprotein E ε4.
RESULTS: Each 0.01 mL/kg/m greater energy cost was associated with 18% higher odds of being Aβ+ (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.34; P = .011). These findings were not observed when investigating gait speed (OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.01; P = .321).
DISCUSSION: High energetic cost of walking is linked to AD pathology and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34136636,A profile of brain reserve in adults at genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our aim was to identify the structural brain measures that mitigate the negative effect of APOE ε4 on cognition, which would have implications for AD diagnosis and treatment trial selection.
METHODS: A total of 742 older adults (mean age: 70.1 ± 8.7 years) were stratified by APOE status and classified as cognitively normal (CDR 0) or with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5). Regional brain volume and cognitive performance were measured.
RESULTS: There were significant interactions between APOE and CDR on the left precuneus and on bilateral superior frontal volumes. These regions were preserved in CDR-0 ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 carriers but were reduced in CDR-0.5 ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 carriers, compared to their respective ε3/ε3 counterparts. Educational attainment predicted greater brain reserve.
DISCUSSION: This pattern of preserved brain structure in cognitively normal ε4 carriers with comprised medial temporal volume is consistent with the theory of brain reserve.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34466653,Head injury is associated with tau deposition on PET in MCI and AD patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Head injuries (HI) are a risk factor for dementia, but the underlying etiology is not fully known. Understanding whether tau might mediate this relationship is important.
METHODS: Cognition and tau deposition were compared between 752 individuals with (impaired, n = 302) or without cognitive impairment (CN, n = 450) with amyloid and [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir positron emission tomography, HI history information, and cognitive testing from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Indiana Memory and Aging Study.
RESULTS: Sixty-three (38 CN, 25 impaired) reported a history of HI. Higher neuropsychiatric scores and poorer memory were observed in those with a history of HI. Tau was higher in individuals with a history of HI, especially those who experienced a loss of consciousness (LOC). Results were driven by impaired individuals, especially amyloid beta-positive individuals with history of HI with LOC.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest biological changes, such as greater tau, are associated with HI in individuals with cognitive impairment. Small effect sizes were observed; thus, further studies should replicate and extend these results.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34692978,Objective subtle cognitive decline and plasma phosphorylated tau181: Early markers of Alzheimer's disease-related declines.,"INTRODUCTION: Objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD) and plasma phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) are promising early Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers. However, associations between Obj-SCD and p-tau181, and their combined prognostic potential, are unknown.
METHODS: Baseline and 4-year longitudinal p-tau181 changes were compared across cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 402), Obj-SCD (n = 199), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 346) groups. CU and Obj-SCD participants were further classified as p-tau181-positive or negative.
RESULTS: CU and Obj-SCD has lower baseline p-tau181 than MCI and did not differ from one another. Longitudinally, Obj-SCD had the steepest p-tau181 increase. Obj-SCD/p-tau181-positive participants had the fastest rates of amyloid accumulation, cognitive decline, and functional decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite assumptions that cognitive changes invariably follow biomarker changes, early neuropsychological difficulties may emerge before/concurrently with plasma p-tau181 changes. Combining Obj-SCD and p-tau181, two potentially accessible early markers, was associated with the faster declines in AD-related outcomes.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34189248,Fractal motor activity regulation and sex differences in preclinical Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Degradation in fractal motor activity regulation (FMAR), a measure of multiscale self-similarity of motor control, occurs in aging and accelerates with clinical progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether FMAR changes occur during the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease in women and men remains unknown.
METHODS: FMAR was assessed in cognitively normal participants (n = 178) who underwent 7 to 14 days of home actigraphy. Preclinical AD pathology was determined by amyloid imaging-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau) to amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) ratio.
RESULTS: Degradation in daytime FMAR was overall significantly associated with preclinical amyloid plaque pathology via PiB+ imaging (beta coefficient β = 0.217, standard error [SE] = 0.101, P = .034) and increasing CSF tau181-Aβ42 ratio (β = 0.220, SE = 0.084, P = .009). In subset analysis by sex, the effect sizes were significant in women for PiB+ (β = 0.279, SE = 0.112, P = .015) and CSF (β = 0.245, SE = 0.094, P = .011) but not in men (both Ps &gt; .05). These associations remained after inclusion of daily activity level, apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status, and rest/activity patterns.
DISCUSSION: Changes in daytime FMAR from actigraphy appear to be present in women early in preclinical AD. This may be a combination of earlier pathology changes in females reflected in daytime FMAR, and a relatively underpowered male group. Further studies are warranted to test FMAR as an early noncognitive physiological biomarker that precedes the onset of cognitive symptoms.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
34430703,Feasibility study for detection of retinal amyloid in clinical trials: The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The retina and brain exhibit similar pathologies in patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to access the retina through imaging techniques opens the possibility for non-invasive evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. While retinal amyloid deposits are detected in individuals clinically diagnosed with AD, studies including preclinical individuals are lacking, limiting assessment of the feasibility of retinal imaging as a biomarker for early-stage AD risk detection.
METHODS: In this small cross-sectional study we compare retinal and cerebral amyloid in clinically normal individuals who screened positive for high amyloid levels through positron emission tomography (PET) from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) trial as well as a companion cohort of individuals who exhibited low levels of amyloid PET in the Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) study. We quantified the number of curcumin-positive fluorescent retinal spots from a small subset of participants from both studies to determine retinal amyloid deposition at baseline.
RESULTS: The four participants from the A4 trial showed a greater number of retinal spots compared to the four participants from the LEARN study. We observed a positive correlation between retinal spots and brain amyloid, as measured by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr).
DISCUSSION: The results of this small pilot study support the use of retinal fundus imaging for detecting amyloid deposition that is correlated with brain amyloid PET SUVr. A larger sample size will be necessary to fully ascertain the relationship between amyloid PET and retinal amyloid both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021

34798903,Serum zinc levels and in vivo beta-amyloid deposition in the human brain.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the known associations between zinc levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and related cognitive impairment, the underlying neuropathological links remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that serum zinc level is associated with cerebral beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) deposition. Additionally, we explored associations between serum zinc levels and other AD pathologies [i.e., tau deposition and AD-signature cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-CM)] and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are measures of cerebrovascular injury.
METHODS: A total of 241 cognitively normal older adults between 55 and 90 years of age were enrolled. All the participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessments, serum zinc level measurement, and multimodal brain imaging, including Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PET), AV-1451 PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. Zinc levels were stratified into three categories: < 80 μg/dL (low), 80 to 90 μg/dL (medium), and > 90 μg/dL (high).
RESULTS: A low serum zinc level was significantly associated with increased Aβ retention. In addition, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4) status moderated the association: the relationship between low zinc level and Aβ retention was significant only in APOE4 carriers. Although a low zinc level appeared to reduce AD-CM, the relationship became insignificant on sensitivity analysis including only individuals with no nutritional deficiency. The serum zinc level was associated with neither tau deposition nor the WMH volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that decreased serum zinc levels are associated with elevation of brain amyloid deposition. In terms of AD prevention, more attention needs to be paid to the role of zinc.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2021
34732252,Dysregulated expression levels of APH1B in peripheral blood are associated with brain atrophy and amyloid-β deposition in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The interaction between the brain and periphery might play a crucial role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Using blood transcriptomic profile data from two independent AD cohorts, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) analysis of 29 significant genetic loci from a recent large-scale genome-wide association study to investigate the effects of the AD genetic variants on gene expression levels and identify their potential target genes. We then performed differential gene expression analysis of identified AD target genes and linear regression analysis to evaluate the association of differentially expressed genes with neuroimaging biomarkers.
RESULTS: A cis-eQTL analysis identified and replicated significant associations in seven genes (APH1B, BIN1, FCER1G, GATS, MS4A6A, RABEP1, TRIM4). APH1B expression levels in the blood increased in AD and were associated with entorhinal cortical thickness and global cortical amyloid-β deposition.
CONCLUSION: An integrative analysis of genetics, blood-based transcriptomic profiles, and imaging biomarkers suggests that APH1B expression levels in the blood might play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2021
34727970,The apolipoprotein receptor LRP3 compromises APP levels.,"BACKGROUND: Members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family are involved in endocytosis and in transducing signals, but also in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and β-amyloid secretion. ApoER2/LRP8 is a member of this family with key roles in synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. ApoER2 is cleaved after the binding of its ligand, the reelin protein, generating an intracellular domain (ApoER2-ICD) that modulates reelin gene transcription itself. We have analyzed whether ApoER2-ICD is able to regulate the expression of other LDL receptors, and we focused on LRP3, the most unknown member of this family. We analyzed LRP3 expression in middle-aged individuals (MA) and in cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology, and the relation of LRP3 with APP.
METHODS: The effects of full-length ApoER2 and ApoER2-ICD overexpression on protein levels, in the presence of recombinant reelin or Aβ42 peptide, were evaluated by microarray, qRT-PCRs, and western blots in SH-SY5Y cells. LRP3 expression was analyzed in human frontal cortex extracts from MA subjects (mean age 51.8±4.8 years) and AD-related pathology subjects [Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages I-II, 68.4±8.8 years; III-IV, 80.4 ± 8.8 years; V-VI, 76.5±9.7 years] by qRT-PCRs and western blot; LRP3 interaction with other proteins was assessed by immunoprecipitation. In CHO cells overexpressing LRP3, protein levels of full-length APP and fragments were evaluated by western blots. Chloroquine was employed to block the lysosomal/autophagy function.
RESULTS: We have identified that ApoER2 overexpression increases LRP3 expression, also after reelin stimulation of ApoER2 signaling. The same occurred following ApoER2-ICD overexpression. In extracts from subjects with AD-related pathology, the levels of LRP3 mRNA and protein were lower than those in MA subjects. Interestingly, LRP3 transfection in CHO-PS70 cells induced a decrease of full-length APP levels and APP-CTF, particularly in the membrane fraction. In cell supernatants, levels of APP fragments from the amyloidogenic (sAPPα) or non-amyloidogenic (sAPPβ) pathways, as well as Aβ peptides, were drastically reduced with respect to mock-transfected cells. The inhibitor of lysosomal/autophagy function, chloroquine, significantly increased full-length APP, APP-CTF, and sAPPα levels.
CONCLUSIONS: ApoER2/reelin signaling regulates LRP3 expression, whose levels are affected in AD; LRP3 is involved in the regulation of APP levels.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2021
34863295,"Clinical and analytical comparison of six Simoa assays for plasma P-tau isoforms P-tau181, P-tau217, and P-tau231.","INTRODUCTION: Studies using different assays and technologies showed highly promising diagnostic value of plasma phosphorylated (P-)tau levels for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to compare six P-tau Simoa assays, including three P-tau181 (Eli Lilly, ADx, Quanterix), one P-tau217 (Eli Lilly), and two P-tau231 (ADx, Gothenburg).
METHODS: We studied the analytical (sensitivity, precision, parallelism, dilution linearity, and recovery) and clinical (40 AD dementia patients, age 66±8years, 50%F; 40 age- and sex-matched controls) performance of the assays.
RESULTS: All assays showed robust analytical performance, and particularly P-tau217 Eli Lilly; P-tau231 Gothenburg and all P-tau181 assays showed robust clinical performance to differentiate AD from controls, with AUCs 0.936-0.995 (P-tau231 ADx: AUC = 0.719). Results obtained with all P-tau181 assays, P-tau217 Eli Lilly assay, and P-tau231 Gothenburg assay strongly correlated (Spearman's rho > 0.86), while correlations with P-tau231 ADx results were moderate (rho < 0.65).

34847922,"Dementia in Southeast Asia: influence of onset-type, education, and cerebrovascular disease.","BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia represents 10% of the global population, yet little is known about regional clinical characteristics of dementia and risk factors for dementia progression. This study aims to describe the clinico-demographic profiles of dementia in Southeast Asia and investigate the association of onset-type, education, and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) on dementia progression in a real-world clinic setting.
METHODS: In this longitudinal study, participants were consecutive series of 1606 patients with dementia from 2010 to 2019 from a tertiary memory clinic from Singapore. The frequency of dementia subtypes stratified into young-onset (YOD; <65 years age-at-onset) and late-onset dementia (LOD; ≥65 years age-at-onset) was studied. Association of onset-type (YOD or LOD), years of lifespan education, and CVD on the trajectory of cognition was evaluated using linear mixed models. The time to significant cognitive decline was investigated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) was the most common diagnosis (59.8%), followed by vascular dementia (14.9%) and frontotemporal dementia (11.1%). YOD patients accounted for 28.5% of all dementia patients. Patients with higher lifespan education had a steeper decline in global cognition (p<0.001), with this finding being more pronounced in YOD (p=0.0006). Older patients with a moderate-to-severe burden of CVD demonstrated a trend for a faster decline in global cognition compared to those with a mild burden.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high frequency of YOD with DAT being most common in our Southeast Asian memory clinic cohort. YOD patients with higher lifespan education and LOD patients with moderate-to-severe CVD experience a steep decline in cognition.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2021
33843952,Extension of Mendelian Randomization to Identify Earliest Manifestations of Alzheimer Disease: Association of Genetic Risk Score for Alzheimer Disease With Lower Body Mass Index by Age 50 Years.,"Weight loss or lower body mass index (BMI) could be an early symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD), but when this begins to emerge is difficult to estimate with traditional observational data. In an extension of Mendelian randomization, we leveraged variation in genetic risk for late-onset AD risk to estimate the causal effect of AD on BMI and the earliest ages at which AD-related weight loss (or lower BMI as a proxy) occurs. We studied UK Biobank participants enrolled in 2006-2010, who were without dementia, aged 39-73, with European genetic ancestry. BMI was calculated with measured height/weight (weight (kg)/height (m)2). An AD genetic risk score (AD-GRS) was calculated based on 23 genetic variants. Using linear regressions, we tested the association of AD-GRS with BMI, stratified by decade, and calculated the age of divergence in BMI trends between low and high AD-GRS. AD-GRS was not associated with BMI in 39- to 49-year-olds (β = 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.03, 0.03). AD-GRS was associated with lower BMI in 50- to 59-year-olds (β = -0.03, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.01) and 60- to 73-year-olds (β = -0.09, 95% CI:-0.12, -0.07). Model-based BMI age curves for high versus low AD-GRS began to diverge after age 47 years. Sensitivity analyses found no evidence for pleiotropy or survival bias. Longitudinal replication is needed; however, our findings suggest that AD genes might begin to reduce BMI decades prior to dementia diagnosis.",Am J Epidemiol,2021
34041783,Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in Relationship to Alzheimer and Vascular Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.
METHODS: Fifty-five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain-specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.
RESULTS: Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.
INTERPRETATION: These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:227-238.",Ann Neurol,2021
33550655,Apolipoprotein E4 Reduction with Antisense Oligonucleotides Decreases Neurodegeneration in a Tauopathy Model.,"OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid-β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau-mediated neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Herein, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO-treated mice.
INTERPRETATION: We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be explored further as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:952-966.",Ann Neurol,2021
34753427,ReRF-Pred: predicting amyloidogenic regions of proteins based on their pseudo amino acid composition and tripeptide composition.,"BACKGROUND: Amyloids are insoluble fibrillar aggregates that are highly associated with complex human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type II diabetes. Recently, many studies reported that some specific regions of amino acid sequences may be responsible for the amyloidosis of proteins. It has become very important for elucidating the mechanism of amyloids that identifying the amyloidogenic regions. Accordingly, several computational methods have been put forward to discover amyloidogenic regions. The majority of these methods predicted amyloidogenic regions based on the physicochemical properties of amino acids. In fact, position, order, and correlation of amino acids may also influence the amyloidosis of proteins, which should be also considered in detecting amyloidogenic regions.
RESULTS: To address this problem, we proposed a novel machine-learning approach for predicting amyloidogenic regions, called ReRF-Pred. Firstly, the pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) was exploited to characterize physicochemical properties and correlation of amino acids. Secondly, tripeptides composition (TPC) was employed to represent the order and position of amino acids. To improve the distinguishability of TPC, all possible tripeptides were analyzed by the binomial distribution method, and only those which have significantly different distribution between positive and negative samples remained. Finally, all samples were characterized by PseAAC and TPC of their amino acid sequence, and a random forest-based amyloidogenic regions predictor was trained on these samples. It was proved by validation experiments that the feature set consisted of PseAAC and TPC is the most distinguishable one for detecting amyloidosis. Meanwhile, random forest is superior to other concerned classifiers on almost all metrics. To validate the effectiveness of our model, ReRF-Pred is compared with a series of gold-standard methods on two datasets: Pep-251 and Reg33. The results suggested our method has the best overall performance and makes significant improvements in discovering amyloidogenic regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of our method are mainly attributed to that PseAAC and TPC can describe the differences between amyloids and other proteins successfully. The ReRF-Pred server can be accessed at http://106.12.83.135:8080/ReRF-Pred/.",BMC Bioinformatics,2021
34775974,Prediction of P-tau/Aβ42 in the cerebrospinal fluid with blood microRNAs in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: The most common biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or with positron emission tomography imaging. However, these procedures are invasive and expensive, which hamper their availability to the general population. Here, we report a panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum that can predict P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF and readily differentiate AD from other dementias, including vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and dementia with Lewy body (DLB).
METHODS: RNA samples were extracted from the participant's blood. P-tau/Aβ42 of CSF was examined for diagnostic purposes. A pilot study (controls, 21; AD, 23), followed by second (controls, 216; AD, 190) and third groups (controls, 153; AD, 151), is used to establish and verify a predictive model of P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF. The test is then applied to a fourth group of patients with different dementias (controls, 139; AD,155; amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], 55; VaD, 51; PDD, 53; bvFTD, 53; DLB, 52) to assess its diagnostic capacity.
RESULTS: In the pilot study, 29 upregulated and 31 downregulated miRNAs in the AD group were found. In Dataset 2, these miRNAs were then included as independent variables in the linear regression model. A seven-microRNA panel (miR-139-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-485-5p, miR-10a-5P, miR-26b-5p, and miR-451a-5p) accurately predicted values of P-tau/Aβ42 of CSF. In Datasets 3 and 4, by applying the predicted P-tau/Aβ42, the predictive model successfully differentiates AD from controls and VaD, PDD, bvFTD, and DLB.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the panel of microRNAs is a promising substitute for traditional measurement of P-tau/Aβ42 in CSF as an effective biomarker of AD.",BMC Med,2021
33663471,Sensitivity and specificity of the Bamberg Dementia Screening Test's (BDST) full and short versions: brief screening instruments for geriatric patients that are suitable for infectious environments.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, many patients suffering from dementia do not have a diagnosis when admitted to geriatric hospitals. This is the case despite an increased risk of complications affecting the length of stay and outcome. Unfortunately, many dementia screening tests cannot be used on geriatric inpatients, who are often bedridden. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of a small battery of bedside tasks that require minimal vision and fine motor skills in patients with suspected dementia.
METHODS: In this prospective study, the Bamberg Dementia Screening Test (BDST) was administered to a consecutive series of 1295 patients referred for neuropsychological testing. The diagnosis of dementia was confirmed in 1159 and excluded in 136 patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the first subtest (ultra-short form), the first two subtests (short form), and the total score of the BDST were obtained via receiver operating characteristic curves and compared with the sensitivity and specificity values of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE).
RESULTS: The overall diagnostic quality of the BDST was superior to the MMSE for mild Alzheimer's dementia (sensitivity and specificity = .94 (95% CI .92 to .96) and .82 (95% CI .75 to .88) vs. .79 (95% CI .76 to .83) and .88 (95% CI .82 to .93)) as well as for other subtypes of mild dementia (sensitivity and specificity = .91 (95% CI .88 to .94) and .82 (95% CI .75 to .88) vs. .72 (95% CI .67 to .76) and .88 (95% CI .82 to .93)). Even the short form of the BDST was comparable to the MMSE regarding sensitivity and specificity. For moderate dementia, it was possible to identify dementia cases with sufficient and excellent diagnostic quality by using the ultra-short and the short form.
CONCLUSIONS: The BDST is able to detect dementia in geriatric hospital settings. If the adaptive algorithm is used, administration time can be reduced to less than 2 min in most cases. Because no test materials have to be exchanged, this test is particularly suitable for infectious environments where contact between the examiner and the person being tested should be minimized.",BMC Med,2021
33331865,A Bayesian linear mixed model for prediction of complex traits.,"MOTIVATION: Accurate disease risk prediction is essential for precision medicine. Existing models either assume that diseases are caused by groups of predictors with small-to-moderate effects or a few isolated predictors with large effects. Their performance can be sensitive to the underlying disease mechanisms, which are usually unknown in advance.
RESULTS: We developed a Bayesian linear mixed model (BLMM), where genetic effects were modelled using a hybrid of the sparsity regression and linear mixed model with multiple random effects. The parameters in BLMM were inferred through a computationally efficient variational Bayes algorithm. The proposed method can resemble the shape of the true effect size distributions, captures the predictive effects from both common and rare variants, and is robust against various disease models. Through extensive simulations and the application to a whole-genome sequencing dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiatives, we have demonstrated that BLMM has better prediction performance than existing methods and can detect variables and/or genetic regions that are predictive.

32683450,Co-sparse reduced-rank regression for association analysis between imaging phenotypes and genetic variants.,"MOTIVATION: The association analysis between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes must be carried out to understand the inherited neuropsychiatric disorders via imaging genetic studies. Given the high dimensionality in imaging and genetic data, traditional methods based on massive univariate regression entail large computational cost and disregard many-to-many correlations between phenotypes and genetic variants. Several multivariate imaging genetic methods have been proposed to alleviate the above problems. However, most of these methods are based on the l1 penalty, which might cause the over-selection of variables and thus mislead scientists in analyzing data from the field of neuroimaging genetics.
RESULTS: To address these challenges in both statistics and computation, we propose a novel co-sparse reduced-rank regression model that identifies complex correlations in a dimensional reduction manner. We developed an iterative algorithm based on a group primal dual-active set formulation to detect simultaneously important genetic variants and imaging phenotypes efficiently and precisely via non-convex penalty. The simulation studies showed that our method achieved accurate and stable performance in parameter estimation and variable selection. In real application, the proposed approach successfully detected several novel Alzheimer's disease-related genetic variants and regions of interest, which indicate that our method may be a valuable statistical toolbox for imaging genetic studies.

33523132,A gene-level methylome-wide association analysis identifies novel Alzheimer's disease genes.,"MOTIVATION: Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have successfully facilitated the discovery of novel genetic risk loci for many complex traits, including late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most existing TWAS methods rely only on gene expression and ignore epigenetic modification (i.e., DNA methylation) and functional regulatory information (i.e., enhancer-promoter interactions), both of which contribute significantly to the genetic basis of AD.
RESULTS: We develop a novel gene-level association testing method that integrates genetically regulated DNA methylation and enhancer-target gene pairs with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary results. Through simulations, we show that our approach, referred to as the CMO (cross methylome omnibus) test, yielded well controlled type I error rates and achieved much higher statistical power than competing methods under a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, compared with TWAS, CMO identified an average of 124% more associations when analyzing several brain imaging-related GWAS results. By analyzing to date the largest AD GWAS of 71,880 cases and 383,378 controls, CMO identified six novel loci for AD, which have been ignored by competing methods.

35052691,Sensitive Electrochemical Detection of Phosphorylated-Tau Threonine 231 in Human Serum Using Interdigitated Wave-Shaped Electrode.,"The development of an electrochemical biosensor for the detection of phosphorylated-tau threonine 231 (p-tau231), a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has yet to be achieved. Therefore, in this study, we developed a simple, small size, cheap, and sensitive electrochemical biosensor based on an interdigitated wave-shaped electrode via an activated self-assembled monolayer to preserve a specific anti-p-tau231 antibody (IWE/SAM/EDC-NHS/anti-p-tau231). Detection of p-tau231 in human serum (HS) using the biosensor was undertaken using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The change in charge-transfer resistance (R<sub>ct</sub>) in the EIS analysis of the biosensor indicated the detection of p-tau231 in HS within a wide linear range of detection (10<sup>-4</sup>-10<sup>1</sup> ng mL<sup>-1</sup>), and a low limit of detection (140 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>). This lower limit is less than the detection level of p-tau231 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (700 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>) of AD patients and the level of CSF p-tau231 of patients with mild cognitive impairment (501 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>), demonstrating the possibility of using the biosensor in detection of p-tau231 at early stage AD. A high binding affinity and low dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) between anti-p-tau231 and p-tau231 in HS was demonstrated by using a biosensor and K<sub>d</sub> was 7.6 pM, demonstrating the high specific detection of p-tau231 by the biosensor. The good selectivity of the biosensor for the detection of p-tau231 with differential analytes was also examined in this study.",Biomedicines,2021
34589793,Microglial functional alteration and increased diversity in the challenged brain: Insights into novel targets for intervention.,"Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, which perform beneficial physiological roles across life. These immune cells actively maintain CNS health by clearing toxic debris and removing dysfunctional or degenerating cells. They also modify the wiring of neuronal circuits, by acting on the formation, modification, and elimination of synapses-the connections between neurons. Microglia furthermore recently emerged as highly diverse cells comprising several structural and functional states, indicating a far more critical involvement in orchestrating brain development, plasticity, behaviour, and cognition. Various environmental factors, together with the individual genetic predispositions, confer an increased risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as neurodegenerative diseases that include autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, across life. Microglia are highly sensitive to chronic psychological stress, inadequate diet, viral/bacterial infection, pollution, and insufficient or altered sleep, especially during critical developmental periods, but also throughout life. These environmental challenges can compromise microglial physiological functions, resulting notably in defective neuronal circuit wiring, altered brain functional connectivity, and the onset of behavioral deficits into adolescence, adulthood, and aging. This short review provides a historical and technical perspective, notably focused on my contribution to the field, on how environmental challenges affect microglia, particularly their physiological functions, and increase their diversity, which provides novel targets for intervention.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2021
34927073,"Amyloid-β, p-tau and reactive microglia are pathological correlates of MRI cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cortical atrophy on MRI and abnormal depositions of amyloid-beta, phosphorylated-tau and inflammation pathologically. However, the relative contribution of these pathological hallmarks to cortical atrophy, a widely used MRI biomarker in Alzheimer's disease, is yet to be defined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the histopathological correlates of MRI cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease donors, and its typical amnestic and atypical non-amnestic phenotypes. Nineteen Alzheimer's disease (of which 10 typical and 9 atypical) and 10 non-neurological control brain donors underwent post-mortem in situ 3T 3D-T1, from which cortical thickness was calculated with Freesurfer. Upon subsequent autopsy, 12 cortical brain regions from the right hemisphere and 9 from the left hemisphere were dissected and immunostained for amyloid-beta, phosphorylated-tau and reactive microglia, and percentage area load was calculated for each marker using ImageJ. In addition, post-mortem MRI was compared to ante-mortem MRI of the same Alzheimer's disease donors when available. MRI-pathology associations were assessed using linear mixed models. Higher amyloid-beta load weakly correlated with higher cortical thickness globally (r = 0.22, P = 0.022). Phosphorylated-tau strongly correlated with cortical atrophy in temporal and frontal regions (-0.76 &lt; r &lt; -1.00, all P &lt; 0.05). Reactive microglia load strongly correlated with cortical atrophy in the parietal region (r = -0.94, P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, post-mortem MRI scans showed high concordance with ante-mortem scans acquired &lt;1 year before death. In conclusion, distinct histopathological markers differently correlated with cortical atrophy, highlighting their different roles in the neurodegenerative process, and therefore contributing to the understanding of the pathological underpinnings of MRI atrophic patterns in Alzheimer's disease. In our cohort, no or only subtle differences were found in MRI-pathology associations in Alzheimer's disease phenotypes, indicating that the histopathological correlates of cortical atrophy in typical and atypical phenotypes might be similar. Moreover, we show that post-mortem in situ MRI can be used as proxy for ante-mortem in vivo MRI.",Brain Commun,2021
33847357,Bridging heterogeneous mutation data to enhance disease gene discovery.,"Bridging heterogeneous mutation data fills in the gap between various data categories and propels discovery of disease-related genes. It is known that genome-wide association study (GWAS) infers significant mutation associations that link genotype and phenotype. However, due to the differences of size and quality between GWAS studies, not all de facto vital variations are able to pass the multiple testing. In the meantime, mutation events widely reported in literature unveil typical functional biological process, including mutation types like gain of function and loss of function. To bring together the heterogeneous mutation data, we propose a 'Gene-Disease Association prediction by Mutation Data Bridging (GDAMDB)' pipeline with a statistic generative model. The model learns the distribution parameters of mutation associations and mutation types and recovers false-negative GWAS mutations that fail to pass significant test but represent supportive evidences of functional biological process in literature. Eventually, we applied GDAMDB in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicted 79 AD-associated genes. Besides, 12 of them from the original GWAS, 60 of them are supported to be AD-related by other GWAS or literature report, and rest of them are newly predicted genes. Our model is capable of enhancing the GWAS-based gene association discovery by well combining text mining results. The positive result indicates that bridging the heterogeneous mutation data is contributory for the novel disease-related gene discovery.",Brief Bioinform,2021

33326751,Pulse-Chase Proteomics of the App Knockin Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease Reveals that Synaptic Dysfunction Originates in Presynaptic Terminals.,"Compromised protein homeostasis underlies accumulation of plaques and tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To observe protein turnover at early stages of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteotoxicity, we performed pulse-chase proteomics on mouse brains in three genetic models of AD that knock in alleles of amyloid precursor protein (APP) prior to the accumulation of plaques and during disease progression. At initial stages of Aβ accumulation, the turnover of proteins associated with presynaptic terminals is selectively impaired. Presynaptic proteins with impaired turnover, particularly synaptic vesicle (SV)-associated proteins, have elevated levels, misfold in both a plaque-dependent and -independent manner, and interact with APP and Aβ. Concurrent with elevated levels of SV-associated proteins, we found an enlargement of the SV pool as well as enhancement of presynaptic potentiation. Together, our findings reveal that the presynaptic terminal is particularly vulnerable and represents a critical site for manifestation of initial AD etiology.

34795427,Astrocytic ApoE underlies maturation of hippocampal neurons and cognitive recovery after traumatic brain injury in mice.,"Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene confer a major genetic risk for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are predictive of outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Alterations in adult hippocampal neurogenesis have long been associated with both the development of AD and recovery following TBI and ApoE is known to play a role in this process. In order to determine how ApoE might influence hippocampal injury-induced neurogenesis, we generated a conditional knockout system whereby functional ApoE from astrocytes was ablated prior to injury. While successfully ablating ApoE just prior to TBI in mice, we observed an attenuation in the development of the spines in the newborn neurons. Intriguingly, animals with a double-hit, i.e. injury and ApoE conditionally inactivated in astrocytes, demonstrated the most pronounced impairments in the hippocampal-dependent Morris water maze test, failing to exhibit spatial memory after both acquisition and reversal training trials. In comparison, conditional knockout mice without injury displayed impairments but only in the reversal phase of the test, suggesting accumulative effects of astrocytic ApoE deficiency and traumatic brain injury on AD-like phenotypes. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytic ApoE is required for functional injury-induced neurogenesis following traumatic brain injury.",Commun Biol,2021
33998138,TRPV1 sustains microglial metabolic reprogramming in Alzheimer's disease.,"As the brain-resident innate immune cells, reactive microglia are a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact role of microglia is still unclear in AD pathogenesis. Here, using metabolic profiling, we show that microglia energy metabolism is significantly suppressed during chronic Aβ-tolerant processes including oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis via the mTOR-AKT-HIF-1α pathway. Pharmacological activation of TRPV1 rescues Aβ-tolerant microglial dysfunction, the AKT/mTOR pathway activity, and metabolic impairments and restores the immune responses including phagocytic activity and autophagy function. Amyloid pathology and memory impairment are accelerated in microglia-specific TRPV1-knockout APP/PS1 mice. Finally, we showed that metabolic boosting with TRPV1 agonist decreases amyloid pathology and reverses memory deficits in AD mice model. These results indicate that TRPV1 is an important target regulating metabolic reprogramming for microglial functions in AD treatment.",EMBO Rep,2021

The aim of this study was to determine serum levels of IL-17, TNF-α and netrin-1in a cohort of AD and MCI patients, and to study the relationship between these cytokines and cognitive status, as well as to assess the possible relationships between netrin-1 levels and inflammatory molecules.
METHODS: Serum concentrations of netrin-1, TNF-α and IL-17 were determined in 20 AD patients, 22 MCI patients and 22 healthy controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, neuropsychological evaluations and psychometric assessments were performed in all subjects.
RESULTS: Serum netrin-1 levels were decreased in AD and MCI patients and were positively correlated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. In contrast, serum TNF-α and IL-17 levels were elevated in AD and MCI cohorts and negatively correlated with MMSE scores. Serum netrin-1 levels were inversely related with TNF-α and IL-17 levels in AD, but not MCI, patients.
CONCLUSION: Based on the findings reported here, netrin-1 may serve as a marker for the early recognition of dementia and predict cognitive impairment.",Front Aging Neurosci,2021
34946903,The APOE ε4 Allele Affects Cognitive Functions Differently in Carriers of APP Mutations Compared to Carriers of PSEN1 Mutations in Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer's Disease.,"Mounting evidence shows that the APOE ε4 allele interferes with cognition in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Less is known about APOE in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (adAD). The present study explored the effects on cognition associated with the gene-gene interactions between the APOE gene and the APP and PSEN1 genes in adAD. This study includes mutation carriers (MC) and non-carriers (NC) from adAD families with mutations in APP (n = 28 and n = 25; MC and NC, respectively) and PSEN1 (n = 12 and n = 15; MC and NC, respectively) that represent the complete spectrum of disease: AD dementia (n = 8) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 15 and presymptomatic AD, n = 17). NC represented unimpaired normal aging. There was no significant difference in the distribution of APOE ε4 (absence vs. presence) between the APP vs. PSEN1 adAD genes and mutation status (MC vs. NC). However, episodic memory was significantly affected by the interaction between APOE and the APP vs. PSEN1 genes in MC. This was explained by favorable performance in the absence of APOE ε4 in PSEN1 compared to APP MC. Similar trends were seen in other cognitive functions. No significant associations between APOE ε4 and cognitive performance were obtained in NC. In conclusion, cognitive effects of APOE-adAD gene interaction were differentiated between the PSEN1 and APP mutation carriers, indicating epistasis.",Genes (Basel),2021
34198788,Shared Genetic Etiology between Alzheimer's Disease and Blood Levels of Specific Cytokines and Growth Factors.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a significant genetic and immunological component, but the molecular mechanisms through which genetic and immunity-related risk factors and their interplay contribute to AD pathogenesis are unclear. Therefore, we screened for genetic sharing between AD and the blood levels of a set of cytokines and growth factors to elucidate how the polygenic architecture of AD affects immune marker profiles. For this, we retrieved summary statistics from Finnish genome-wide association studies of AD and 41 immune marker blood levels and assessed for shared genetic etiology, using a polygenic risk score-based approach. For the blood levels of 15 cytokines and growth factors, we identified genetic sharing with AD. We also found positive and negative genetic concordances-implying that genetic risk factors for AD are associated with higher and lower blood levels-for several immune markers and were able to relate some of these results to the literature. Our results imply that genetic risk factors for AD also affect specific immune marker levels, which may be leveraged to develop novel treatment strategies for AD.",Genes (Basel),2021
34946908,Advances in Genetics and Epigenetic Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease: A Notion for Therapeutic Treatment.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disorder that leads to long-term functional and cognitive impairment and greatly reduces life expectancy. Early genetic studies focused on tracking variations in genome-wide DNA sequences discovered several polymorphisms and novel susceptibility genes associated with AD. However, despite the numerous risk factors already identified, there is still no fully satisfactory explanation for the mechanisms underlying the onset of the disease. Also, as with other complex human diseases, the causes of low heritability are unclear. Epigenetic mechanisms, in which changes in gene expression do not depend on changes in genotype, have attracted considerable attention in recent years and are key to understanding the processes that influence age-related changes and various neurological diseases. With the recent use of massive sequencing techniques, methods for studying epigenome variations in AD have also evolved tremendously, allowing the discovery of differentially expressed disease traits under different conditions and experimental settings. This is important for understanding disease development and for unlocking new potential AD therapies. In this work, we outline the genomic and epigenomic components involved in the initiation and development of AD and identify potentially effective therapeutic targets for disease control.",Genes (Basel),2021
34681041,Association and Gene-Gene Interactions Study of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease in the Russian Population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and represents the most common cause of dementia. In this study, we performed several different analyses to detect loci involved in development of the late onset AD in the Russian population. DNA samples from 472 unrelated subjects were genotyped for 63 SNPs using iPLEX Assay and real-time PCR. We identified five genetic loci that were significantly associated with LOAD risk for the Russian population (TOMM40 rs2075650, APOE rs429358 and rs769449, NECTIN rs6857, APOE ε4). The results of the analysis based on comparison of the haplotype frequencies showed two risk haplotypes and one protective haplotype. The GMDR analysis demonstrated three significant models as a result: a one-factor, a two-factor and a three-factor model. A protein-protein interaction network with three subnetworks was formed for the 24 proteins. Eight proteins with a large number of interactions are identified: APOE, SORL1, APOC1, CD33, CLU, TOMM40, CNTNAP2 and CACNA1C. The present study confirms the importance of the APOE-TOMM40 locus as the main risk locus of development and progress of LOAD in the Russian population. Association analysis and bioinformatics approaches detected interactions both at the association level of single SNPs and at the level of genes and proteins.",Genes (Basel),2021
34573297,Microarray Analysis Revealed Inflammatory Transcriptomic Changes after LSL60101 Treatment in 5XFAD Mice Model.,"I2-IR have been found dysregulated in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which the importance of neuroinflammation in the establishment and maintenance of cognitive decline is well-documented. To research the implication of I2-IR in neuroinflammatory pathways altered in AD, we determined the expression profile of genes associated with inflammation in the 5XFAD model treated with LSL60101, a well-established I2-IR ligand. Thus, we performed a qPCR array containing 84 inflammation-related genes. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three gene clusters, suggesting that treatment with LSL60101 affects the gene expression associated with inflammation in the 5XFAD model. Furthermore, we evaluated the functions of the three clusters; thereby performing a pathway enrichment analysis using the GO database. As we expected, clusters 2 and 3 showed alterations in the inflammatory response, chemotaxis and the chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, among others. To validate previous results from the gene profiling analysis, the expression levels of a representative subset of mRNAs were selected according to the intensity of the observed changes and their biological relevance. Interestingly, changes induced by LSL60101 in the 5XFAD model were validated for several genes. These results suggest that treatment with LSL60101 in the 5XFAD model reverses the inflammatory process during the development of AD.",Genes (Basel),2021

We present a causal inference framework, CoCoA-diff, that prioritizes disease genes by adjusting confounders without prior knowledge of control variables in single-cell RNA-seq data. We demonstrate that our method substantially improves statistical power in simulations and real-world data analysis of 70k brain cells collected for dissecting Alzheimer's disease.

34702310,"Identification and drug-induced reversion of molecular signatures of Alzheimer's disease onset and progression in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>, App<sup>NL-F</sup>, and 3xTg-AD mouse models.","BACKGROUND: In spite of many years of research, our understanding of the molecular bases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still incomplete, and the medical treatments available mainly target the disease symptoms and are hardly effective. Indeed, the modulation of a single target (e.g., β-secretase) has proven to be insufficient to significantly alter the physiopathology of the disease, and we should therefore move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic strategies, where AD-related changes are modulated globally.
METHODS: Here we present the complete characterization of three murine models of AD at different stages of the disease (i.e., onset, progression and advanced). We combined the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses and full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling of the hippocampus. Additionally, we derived specific Aβ-related molecular AD signatures and looked for drugs able to globally revert them.
RESULTS: We found that AD models show accelerated aging and that factors specifically associated with Aβ pathology are involved. We discovered a few proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding transcript levels remain stable, and showed that at least two of them (i.e., lfit3 and Syt11) co-localize with Aβ plaques in the brain. Finally, we found two NSAIDs (dexketoprofen and etodolac) and two anti-hypertensives (penbutolol and bendroflumethiazide) that overturn the cognitive impairment in AD mice while reducing Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and partially restoring the physiological levels of AD signature genes to wild-type levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of three AD mouse models at different disease stages provides an unprecedented view of AD pathology and how this differs from physiological aging. Moreover, our computational strategy to chemically revert AD signatures has shown that NSAID and anti-hypertensive drugs may still have an opportunity as anti-AD agents, challenging previous reports.",Genome Med,2021
33963077,Purifying selection on noncoding deletions of human regulatory loci detected using their cellular pleiotropy.,"Genomic deletions provide a powerful loss-of-function model in noncoding regions to assess the role of purifying selection on genetic variation. Regulatory element function is characterized by nonuniform tissue and cell type activity, necessarily linking the study of fitness consequences from regulatory variants to their corresponding cellular activity. We generated a callset of deletions from genomes in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and used deletions from The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (1000GP) in order to examine whether purifying selection preserves noncoding sites of chromatin accessibility marked by DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS), histone modification (enhancer, transcribed, Polycomb-repressed, heterochromatin), and chromatin loop anchors. To examine this in a cellular activity-aware manner, we developed a statistical method, pleiotropy ratio score (PlyRS), which calculates a correlation-adjusted count of ""cellular pleiotropy"" for each noncoding base pair by analyzing shared regulatory annotations across tissues and cell types. By comparing real deletion PlyRS values to simulations in a length-matched framework and by using genomic covariates in analyses, we found that purifying selection acts to preserve both DHS and enhancer noncoding sites. However, we did not find evidence of purifying selection for noncoding transcribed, Polycomb-repressed, or heterochromatin sites beyond that of the noncoding background. Additionally, we found evidence that purifying selection is acting on chromatin loop integrity by preserving colocalized CTCF binding sites. At regions of DHS, enhancer, and CTCF within chromatin loop anchors, we found evidence that both sites of activity specific to a particular tissue or cell type and sites of cellularly pleiotropic activity are preserved by selection.",Genome Res,2021
34719502,Improving Detection of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment with Sex-Specific Cognitive Norms.,"BackgroundDespite a female advantage in verbal memory, normative data for verbal memory tests used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) often are not sex-adjusted.ObjectiveTo determine whether sex-adjusted norms improve aMCI diagnostic accuracy when accuracy was evaluated by progression to AD dementia over time.MethodsNon-sex-specific and sex-specific verbal memory test norms were incorporated into Jak/Bondi aMCI criteria and applied to older (age 65-90) non-demented women (N = 1,036) and men (N = 355) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Using sex-specific aMCI diagnosis as the ""true"" condition versus non-sex-specific aMCI diagnosis as the ""predicted"" condition, we identified True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives and compared AD dementia risk over 10 years among groups.ResultsRates of aMCI were higher in men versus women (χ2 = 15.39, p < 0.001) when determined based on typical diagnostic criteria, but this difference reversed when using sex-specific diagnostic criteria (χ2 = 8.38, p = 0.004). We identified 8%of women as False Negatives and 12%of men as False Positives. Risk of incident AD dementia in False Positive men was significantly lower than in True Positive men (HR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.12-0.58, p = 0.001). Risk of incident AD dementia in False Negative women was substantially higher than in True Negative women (HR = 3.11, 95%CI = 2.09-4.63, p < 0.001).ConclusionResults suggest that previous reports of higher aMCI rates in men versus women may be an artifact of non-sex-adjusted norms/cut-scores. Incorporation of sex-specific norms/cut-scores for verbal memory impairment into aMCI diagnostic criteria may improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid diagnostic errors in approximately 20%.",J Alzheimers Dis,2021
34719492,The Positive Effects of Pet Ownership on Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Human-animal interactions are known to have many beneficial psychosocial and psychophysiological effects on persons with and without medical health conditions. There are no previous prospective studies with long follow-up times on the effects of domestic pets on the persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) living at home.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of pets on the activities of daily living (ADL), disease progression, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) during a five-year follow-up on the persons with AD.
METHODS: Altogether 223 home-dwelling persons (mean age 75.2 years) with very mild (CDR 0.5) or mild (CDR 1) AD at baseline were included for this study. ADCS-ADL, NPI, MMSE, and CDR-SOB were measured at baseline, annually for three years and after five years.
RESULTS: Totally 40 (17.9%) participants had a pet. At the baseline, pet owners and non-pet owners had no significant differences in age, gender, or the ADCS-ADL, NPS, and CDR-SOB scores, while MMSE was lower in pet owners than non-pet owners (20.2 versus 21.7; p = 0.009). Over the follow-up, pet owners had significantly better mean ADCS-ADL (57.5 versus 54.0; p = 0.031), NPI (9.3 versus 13.0; p = 0.038), and CDR-SOB scores (5.7 versus 6.6; p = 0.004) compared to non-pet owners. The differences in the MMSE scores between the groups detected at baseline attenuated over time.
CONCLUSION: Significant positive effects of the pets on ADL functions, NPS, and disease progression were detected over the whole follow-up suggesting that having a pet may support daily activity and slow the disease progression in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2021

34003967,Rapamycin Activates Mitophagy and Alleviates Cognitive and Synaptic Plasticity Deficits in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by cognitive and synaptic plasticity damage. Rapamycin is an activator of autophagy/mitophagy, which plays an important role in identifying and degrading damaged mitochondria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rapamycin on cognitive and synaptic plasticity defects induced by AD, and further explore if the underlying mechanism was associated with mitophagy. The results show that rapamycin increases Parkin-mediated mitophagy and promotes fusion of mitophagosome and lysosome in the APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus. Rapamycin enhances learning and memory viability, synaptic plasticity, and the expression of synapse-related proteins, impedes cytochrome C-mediated apoptosis, decreases oxidative status, and recovers mitochondrial function in APP/PS1 mice. The data suggest that rapamycin effectively alleviates AD-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity deficits in APP/PS1 mice, which is associated with enhanced mitophagy. Our findings possibly uncover an important function of mitophagy in eliminating damaged mitochondria to attenuate AD-associated pathology.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,2021
34464879,Changes in LASSI-L performance over time among older adults with amnestic MCI and amyloid positivity: A preliminary study.,"There is a pressing need to develop measures that are sensitive to the earliest subtle cognitive changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to improve early detection and track disease progression. The Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference (LASSI-L) has been shown to successfully discriminate between cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to correlate with total and regional brain amyloid load. The present study investigated how the LASSI-L scores change over time among three distinct diagnostic groups. Eighty-six community-dwelling older adults underwent a baseline evaluation including: a clinical interview, a neuropsychological evaluation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET). A follow up evaluation was conducted 12 months later. Initial mean values were calculated using one-way ANOVAs and chi-square analyses. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). A 3 × 2 repeated measures analysis was utilized to examine differences in LASSI-L performance over time. The MCI amyloid positive group demonstrated a significantly greater decline in LASSI-L performance than the MCI amyloid negative and CU groups respectively. The scales that best differentiated the three groups included the Cued A2, which taps into maximum learning capacity, and Cued B2, which assesses the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference. Our findings further support the LASSI-L's discriminative validity.",J Psychiatr Res,2021

34453725,Assessing Rab5 Activation in Health and Disease.,"The endocytic pathway is a system of dynamically communicating vesicles, known as early endosomes, that internalize, sort, and traffic nutrients, trophic factors, and signaling molecules to sites throughout the cell. In all eukaryotic cells, early endosome functions are regulated by Rab5 activity, dependent upon its binding to GTP, whereas Rab5 bound to GDP represents the biologically inactive form. An increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with endocytic dysfunction and, in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), an early appearing highly characteristic reflection of endocytic pathway dysfunction is an abnormal enlargement of Rab5 positive endosomes. In AD and DS, endosome enlargement accompanying accelerated endocytosis and fusion, upregulated transcription of endocytosis-related genes, and aberrant signaling by endosomes are caused by pathological Rab5 overactivation. In this chapter, we describe a battery of methods that have been used to assess Rab5 activation in models of AD/DS and are applicable to other cell and animal disease models. These methods include (1) fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay; (2) quantitative measurement of endosome size by light, fluorescence and electron microscopy; (3) detection of GTP-Rab5 by in situ immunocytochemistry in vitro and ex vivo; (4) immunoprecipitation and GTP-agarose pull-down assay; (5) biochemical detection of Rab5 in endosome-enriched subcellular fractions obtained by OptiPrep™ density gradient centrifugation of mouse brain.",Methods Mol Biol,2021
34456336,The Amyloid-β Pathway in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Breakthroughs in molecular medicine have positioned the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway at the center of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. While the detailed molecular mechanisms of the pathway and the spatial-temporal dynamics leading to synaptic failure, neurodegeneration, and clinical onset are still under intense investigation, the established biochemical alterations of the Aβ cycle remain the core biological hallmark of AD and are promising targets for the development of disease-modifying therapies. Here, we systematically review and update the vast state-of-the-art literature of Aβ science with evidence from basic research studies to human genetic and multi-modal biomarker investigations, which supports a crucial role of Aβ pathway dyshomeostasis in AD pathophysiological dynamics. We discuss the evidence highlighting a differentiated interaction of distinct Aβ species with other AD-related biological mechanisms, such as tau-mediated, neuroimmune and inflammatory changes, as well as a neurochemical imbalance. Through the lens of the latest development of multimodal in vivo biomarkers of AD, this cross-disciplinary review examines the compelling hypothesis- and data-driven rationale for Aβ-targeting therapeutic strategies in development for the early treatment of AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2021

34697451,Loss of TDP-43 function underlies hippocampal and cortical synaptic deficits in TDP-43 proteinopathies.,"TDP-43 proteinopathy is linked to neurodegenerative diseases that feature synaptic loss in the cortex and hippocampus, although it remains unclear how TDP-43 regulates mature synapses. We report that, in adult mouse hippocampus, TDP-43 knockdown, but not overexpression, induces robust structural and functional damage to excitatory synapses, supporting a role for TDP-43 in maintaining mature synapses. Dendritic spine loss induced by TDP-43 knockdown is rescued by wild-type TDP-43, but not ALS/FTLD-associated mutants, suggesting a common TDP-43 functional deficiency in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, M337V and A90V mutants also display dominant negative activities against WT TDP-43, partially explaining why M337V transgenic mice develop hippocampal degeneration similar to that in excitatory neuronal TDP-43 knockout mice, and why A90V mutation is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Further analyses reveal that a TDP-43 knockdown-induced reduction in GluN2A contributes to synaptic loss. Our results show that loss of TDP-43 function underlies hippocampal and cortical synaptic degeneration in TDP-43 proteinopathies.",Mol Psychiatry,2021
33888872,Astroglial tracer BU99008 detects multiple binding sites in Alzheimer's disease brain.,"With reactive astrogliosis being established as one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is high interest in developing novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to detect early astrocyte reactivity. BU99008, a novel astrocytic PET ligand targeting imidazoline-2 binding sites (I<sub>2</sub>BS) on astrocytes, might be a suitable candidate. Here we demonstrate for the first time that BU99008 could visualise reactive astrogliosis in postmortem AD brains and propose a multiple binding site [Super-high-affinity (SH), High-affinity (HA) and Low-affinity (LA)] model for BU99008, I<sub>2</sub>BS specific ligands (2-BFI and BU224) and deprenyl in AD and control (CN) brains. The proportion (%) and affinities of these sites varied significantly between the BU99008, 2-BFI, BU224 and deprenyl in AD and CN brains. Regional binding studies demonstrated significantly higher <sup>3</sup>H-BU99008 binding in AD brain regions compared to CN. Comparative autoradiography studies reinforced these findings, showing higher specific binding for <sup>3</sup>H-BU99008 than <sup>3</sup>H-Deprenyl in sporadic AD brain compared to CN, implying that they might have different targets. The data clearly shows that BU99008 could detect I<sub>2</sub>BS expressing reactive astrocytes with good selectivity and specificity and hence be a potential attractive clinical astrocytic PET tracer for gaining further insight into the role of reactive astrogliosis in AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2021

34381170,Identification of novel drug targets for Alzheimer's disease by integrating genetics and proteomes from brain and blood.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered numerous risk genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how these genes confer AD risk is challenging to decipher. To efficiently transform genetic associations into drug targets for AD, we employed an integrative analytical pipeline using proteomes in the brain and blood by systematically applying proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization. Collectively, we identified the brain protein abundance of 7 genes (ACE, ICA1L, TOM1L2, SNX32, EPHX2, CTSH, and RTFDC1) are causal in AD (P < 0.05/proteins identified for PWAS and MR; PPH4 >80% for Bayesian colocalization). The proteins encoded by these genes were mainly expressed on the surface of glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes. Of them, ACE with its protein abundance was also identified in significant association with AD on the blood-based studies and showed significance at the transcriptomic level. SNX32 was also found to be associated with AD at the blood transcriptomic level. Collectively, our current study results on genetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic approaches has identified compelling genes, which may provide important leads to design future functional studies and potential drug targets for AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2021
34880449,Pyroglutamate Aβ cascade as drug target in Alzheimer's disease.,"One of the central aims in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is the identification of clinically relevant drug targets. A plethora of potential molecular targets work very well in preclinical model systems both in vitro and in vivo in AD mouse models. However, the lack of translation into clinical settings in the AD field is a challenging endeavor. Although it is long known that N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (Aβ<sub>pE3</sub>) peptides are abundantly present in the brain of AD patients, form stable and soluble low-molecular weight oligomers, and induce neurodegeneration in AD mouse models, their potential as drug target has not been generally accepted in the past. This situation has dramatically changed with the report that passive immunization with donanemab, an Aβ<sub>pE3</sub>-specific antibody, cleared aymloid plaques and stabilized cognitive deficits in a group of patients with mild AD in a phase II trial. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of generation of Aβ<sub>pE</sub>, its biochemical properties, and the intervention points as a drug target in AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2021
36172600,Experimental and real-world evidence supporting the computational repurposing of bumetanide for APOE4-related Alzheimer's disease.,"The evident genetic, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses challenges for traditional drug development. We conducted a computational drug repurposing screen for drugs to treat apolipoprotein (apo) E4-related AD. We first established apoE-genotype-dependent transcriptomic signatures of AD by analyzing publicly-available human brain database. We then queried these signatures against the Connectivity Map database containing transcriptomic perturbations of >1300 drugs to identify those that best reverse apoE-genotype-specific AD signatures. Bumetanide was identified as a top drug for apoE4 AD. Bumetanide treatment of apoE4 mice without or with Aβ accumulation rescued electrophysiological, pathological, or cognitive deficits. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed transcriptomic reversal of AD signatures in specific cell types in these mice, a finding confirmed in apoE4-iPSC-derived neurons. In humans, bumetanide exposure was associated with a significantly lower AD prevalence in individuals over the age of 65 in two electronic health record databases, suggesting effectiveness of bumetanide in preventing AD.",Nat Aging,2021
34172723,Protein mimetic amyloid inhibitor potently abrogates cancer-associated mutant p53 aggregation and restores tumor suppressor function.,"Missense mutations in p53 are severely deleterious and occur in over 50% of all human cancers. The majority of these mutations are located in the inherently unstable DNA-binding domain (DBD), many of which destabilize the domain further and expose its aggregation-prone hydrophobic core, prompting self-assembly of mutant p53 into inactive cytosolic amyloid-like aggregates. Screening an oligopyridylamide library, previously shown to inhibit amyloid formation associated with Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes, identified a tripyridylamide, ADH-6, that abrogates self-assembly of the aggregation-nucleating subdomain of mutant p53 DBD. Moreover, ADH-6 targets and dissociates mutant p53 aggregates in human cancer cells, which restores p53's transcriptional activity, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Notably, ADH-6 treatment effectively shrinks xenografts harboring mutant p53, while exhibiting no toxicity to healthy tissue, thereby substantially prolonging survival. This study demonstrates the successful application of a bona fide small-molecule amyloid inhibitor as a potent anticancer agent.",Nat Commun,2021

Here, we integrate two partly complementary techniques-the aptamer-based SomaScan<sup>®</sup> v4 assay and the antibody-based Olink assays-to systematically assess phenotypic consequences of hundreds of pQTLs discovered for 871 protein targets across both platforms. We create a genetically anchored cross-platform proteome-phenome network comprising 547 protein-phenotype connections, 36.3% of which were only seen with one of the two platforms suggesting that both techniques capture distinct aspects of protein biology. We further highlight discordance of genetically predicted effect directions between assays, such as for PILRA and Alzheimer's disease. Our results showcase the synergistic nature of these technologies to better understand and identify disease mechanisms and provide a benchmark for future cross-platform discoveries.",Nat Commun,2021

We further show higher levels of proteins related to soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 are associated with reduced risk of conversion to dementia in the multi-centered (p = 0.027) and independent (p = 0.038) cohorts of people with mild cognitive impairment due to predicted Alzheimer's disease, while higher soluble TREM2 levels associated with slower decline in the dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease.

We included 366 adults with DS (240 asymptomatic, 43 prodromal AD, 83 AD dementia) and 44 euploid cognitively normal controls. We measured plasma p-tau181 with a Single molecule array (Simoa) assay. We examined the diagnostic performance of p-tau181 for the detection of AD and the relationship with other fluid and imaging biomarkers. Plasma p-tau181 concentration showed an area under the curve of 0.80 [95% CI 0.73-0.87] and 0.92 [95% CI 0.89-0.95] for the discrimination between asymptomatic individuals versus those in the prodromal and dementia groups, respectively. Plasma p-tau181 correlated with atrophy and hypometabolism in temporoparietal regions. Our findings indicate that plasma p-tau181 concentration can be useful to detect AD in DS.",Nat Commun,2021
34561430,Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) as a drug target for cardiovascular disease.,"Development of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors for coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to deliver licensed medicines. To distinguish compound from drug target failure, we compared evidence from clinical trials and drug target Mendelian randomization of CETP protein concentration, comparing this to Mendelian randomization of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). We show that previous failures of CETP inhibitors are likely compound related, as illustrated by significant degrees of between-compound heterogeneity in effects on lipids, blood pressure, and clinical outcomes observed in trials. On-target CETP inhibition, assessed through Mendelian randomization, is expected to reduce the risk of CHD, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, while increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration. In contrast, lower PCSK9 concentration is anticipated to decrease the risk of CHD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, while potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and asthma. Due to distinct effects on lipoprotein metabolite profiles, joint inhibition of CETP and PCSK9 may provide added benefit. In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence that CETP is an effective target for CHD prevention but with a potential on-target adverse effect on age-related macular degeneration.",Nat Commun,2021

35045380,Locus coeruleus integrity is related to tau burden and memory loss in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Abnormally phosphorylated tau, an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, accumulates in the first decades of life in the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's main noradrenaline supply. However, technical challenges in in-vivo assessments have impeded research into the role of the LC in Alzheimer's disease. We studied participants with or known to be at-risk for mutations in genes causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) with early onset, providing a unique window into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's largely disentangled from age-related factors. Using high-resolution MRI and tau PET, we found lower rostral LC integrity in symptomatic participants. LC integrity was associated with individual differences in tau burden and memory decline. Post-mortem analyses in a separate set of carriers of the same mutation confirmed substantial neuronal loss in the LC. Our findings link LC degeneration to tau burden and memory in Alzheimer's, and highlight a role of the noradrenergic system in this neurodegenerative disease.",Neurobiol Aging,2021
34847523,Cortical network modularity changes along the course of frontotemporal and Alzheimer's dementing diseases.,"Cortical network modularity underpins cognitive functions, so we hypothesized its progressive derangement along the course of frontotemporal (FTD) and Alzheimer's (AD) dementing diseases. EEG was recorded in 18 FTD, 18 AD, and 20 healthy controls (HC). In the FTD and AD patients, the EEG recordings were performed at the prodromal stage of dementia, at the onset of dementia, and three years after the onset of dementia. HC underwent three EEG recordings at 2-3-year time interval. Information flows underlying EEG activity recorded at electrode pairs were estimated by means of Mutual Information (MI) analysis. The functional organization of the cortical network was modelled by means of the Graph theory analysis on MI adjacency matrices. Graph theory analysis showed that the main hub of HC (Parietal area) was lost in FTD patients at onset of dementia, substituted by provincial hubs in frontal leads. No changes in global network organization were found in AD. Despite a progressive cognitive impairment during the FTD and AD progression, only the FTD patients showed a derangement in the cortical network modularity, possibly due to dysfunctions in frontal functional connectivity.",Neurobiol Aging,2021
34875506,Expression and proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein is unaffected by the expression of the three human apolipoprotein E alleles in the brains of mice.,"The 3 human apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene alleles modify an individual's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD): compared to the risk-neutral APOE ε3 allele, the ε4 allele (APOE4) is strongly associated with increased AD risk while the ε2 allele is protective. Multiple mechanisms have been shown to link APOE4 expression and AD risk, including the possibility that APOE4 increases the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Y-W.A. Huang, B. Zhou, A.M. Nabet, M. Wernig, T.C. Südhof, 2019). In this study, we investigated the impact of APOE genotype on the expression, and proteolytic processing of endogenously expressed APP in the brains of mice humanized for the 3 APOE alleles. In contrast to prior studies using neuronal cultures, we found in the brain that both App gene expression, and the levels of APP holoprotein were not affected by APOE genotype. Additionally, our analysis of APP fragments showed that APOE genotype does not impact APP processing in the brain: the levels of both α- and β-cleaved soluble APP fragments (sAPPs) were similar across genotypes, as were the levels of the membrane-associated α- and β-cleaved C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP. Lastly, APOE genotype did not impact the level of soluble amyloid beta (Aβ). These findings argue that the APOE-allele-dependent AD risk is independent of the brain expression and processing of APP.",Neurobiol Aging,2021

33630843,Hippocampal transcriptome-wide association study and neurobiological pathway analysis for Alzheimer's disease.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by early and progressive damage to the hippocampus. However, the association of hippocampal gene expression with AD and the underlying neurobiological pathways remain largely unknown. Based on the genomic and transcriptomic data of 111 hippocampal samples and the summary data of two large-scale meta-analyses of GWASs, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed to identify genes with significant associations between hippocampal expression and AD. We identified 54 significantly associated genes using an AD-GWAS meta-analysis of 455,258 individuals; 36 of the genes were confirmed in another AD-GWAS meta-analysis of 63,926 individuals. Fine-mapping models further prioritized 24 AD-related genes whose effects on AD were mediated by hippocampal expression, including APOE and two novel genes (PTPN9 and PCDHA4). These genes are functionally related to amyloid-beta formation, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, neuronal apoptosis, neurogenesis and telomerase-related processes. By integrating the predicted hippocampal expression and neuroimaging data, we found that the hippocampal expression of QPCTL and ERCC2 showed significant difference between AD patients and cognitively normal elderly individuals as well as correlated with hippocampal volume. Mediation analysis further demonstrated that hippocampal volume mediated the effect of hippocampal gene expression (QPCTL and ERCC2) on AD. This study identifies two novel genes associated with AD by integrating hippocampal gene expression and genome-wide association data and reveals candidate hippocampus-mediated neurobiological pathways from gene expression to AD.",PLoS Genet,2021
33465062,Htt is a repressor of Abl activity required for APP-induced axonal growth.,"Huntington's disease is a progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract at the N-terminus of a large cytoplasmic protein. The Drosophila huntingtin (htt) gene is widely expressed during all developmental stages from embryos to adults. However, Drosophila htt mutant individuals are viable with no obvious developmental defects. We asked if such defects could be detected in htt mutants in a background that had been genetically sensitized to reveal cryptic developmental functions. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Appl is the Drosophila APP ortholog and Appl signaling modulates axon outgrowth in the mushroom bodies (MBs), the learning and memory center in the fly, in part by recruiting Abl tyrosine kinase. Here, we find that htt mutations suppress axon outgrowth defects of αβ neurons in Appl mutant MB by derepressing the activity of Abl. We show that Abl is required in MB αβ neurons for their axon outgrowth. Importantly, both Abl overexpression and lack of expression produce similar phenotypes in the MBs, indicating the necessity of tightly regulating Abl activity. We find that Htt behaves genetically as a repressor of Abl activity, and consistent with this, in vivo FRET-based measurements reveal a significant increase in Abl kinase activity in the MBs when Htt levels are reduced. Thus, Appl and Htt have essential but opposing roles in MB development, promoting and suppressing Abl kinase activity, respectively, to maintain the appropriate intermediate level necessary for axon growth.",PLoS Genet,2021
33830999,PLD3 is a neuronal lysosomal phospholipase D associated with β-amyloid plaques and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.,"Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) is a protein of unclear function that structurally resembles other members of the phospholipase D superfamily. A coding variant in this gene confers increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the magnitude of this effect has been controversial. Because of the potential significance of this obscure protein, we undertook a study to observe its distribution in normal human brain and AD-affected brain, determine whether PLD3 is relevant to memory and cognition in sporadic AD, and to evaluate its molecular function. In human neuropathological samples, PLD3 was primarily found within neurons and colocalized with lysosome markers (LAMP2, progranulin, and cathepsins D and B). This colocalization was also present in AD brain with prominent enrichment on lysosomal accumulations within dystrophic neurites surrounding β-amyloid plaques. This pattern of protein distribution was conserved in mouse brain in wild type and the 5xFAD mouse model of cerebral β-amyloidosis. We discovered PLD3 has phospholipase D activity in lysosomes. A coding variant in PLD3 reported to confer AD risk significantly reduced enzymatic activity compared to wild-type PLD3. PLD3 mRNA levels in the human pre-frontal cortex inversely correlated with β-amyloid pathology severity and rate of cognitive decline in 531 participants enrolled in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. PLD3 levels across genetically diverse BXD mouse strains and strains crossed with 5xFAD mice correlated strongly with learning and memory performance in a fear conditioning task. In summary, this study identified a new functional mammalian phospholipase D isoform which is lysosomal and closely associated with both β-amyloid pathology and cognition.",PLoS Genet,2021
33715299,Identifying prescribing cascades in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: The calcium channel blocker-diuretic prescribing cascade.,"PURPOSE: Prescribing cascades occur when a physician prescribes a new drug to address the side-effect of another drug. Persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at increased risk for prescribing cascades. Our objective was to develop an approach to estimating the proportion of calcium channel blocker-diuretic (CCB-diuretic) prescribing cascades among persons with ADRD in two U.S. health plans.
METHODS: We identified patients aged ≥50 on January 1, 2017, dispensed a drug to treat ADRD in the 365-days prior to/on cohort entry date. Patients had medical/pharmacy coverage for 1 year before and through cohort entry. We excluded individuals with an institutional stay encounter in the 45 days prior to cohort entry and censored patients based on: disenrollment from coverage, death, or end of data. We identified incident and prevalent CCB use in the 183-days following cohort entry, and identified subsequent incident diuretic use among incident and prevalent CCB-users within 365-days from cohort entry.
RESULTS: There were 121 538 eligible patients. Approximately 62% were female, with a mean age of 79.5 (SD ±8.6). Overall 2.1% of the cohort experienced a prevalent CCB-diuretic prescribing cascade with 1586 incident diuretic-users among 36 462 prevalent CCB-users (4.3%, 95% CI 4.1-4.6%]); and there were161 incident diuretic-users among 3304 incident CCB-users (4.9%, 95% CI 4.2-5.7%) (incident CCB-diuretic cascade).
CONCLUSIONS: We describe an approach to identify prescribing cascades in persons with ADRD, which can be used to assess the proportion of prescribing cascades in large cohorts. We determined the proportion of CCB-diuretic prescribing cascades was low.",Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,2021
34819378,Three-dimensional virtual histology of the human hippocampus based on phase-contrast computed tomography.,"We have studied the three-dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture of the human hippocampus in neuropathologically healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals, based on phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography of postmortem human tissue punch biopsies. In view of recent findings suggesting a nuclear origin of AD, we target in particular the nuclear structure of the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Tissue samples of 20 individuals were scanned and evaluated using a highly automated approach of measurement and analysis, combining multiscale recordings, optimized phase retrieval, segmentation by machine learning, representation of structural properties in a feature space, and classification based on the theory of optimal transport. Accordingly, we find that the prototypical transformation between a structure representing healthy granule cells and the pathological state involves a decrease in the volume of granule cell nuclei, as well as an increase in the electron density and its spatial heterogeneity. The latter can be explained by a higher ratio of heterochromatin to euchromatin. Similarly, many other structural properties can be derived from the data, reflecting both the natural polydispersity of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture between different individuals in the physiological context and the structural effects associated with AD pathology.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2021
34739309,TSC1 loss increases risk for tauopathy by inducing tau acetylation and preventing tau clearance via chaperone-mediated autophagy.,"Age-associated neurodegenerative disorders demonstrating tau-laden intracellular inclusions are known as tauopathies. We previously linked a loss-of-function mutation in the TSC1 gene to tau accumulation and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Now, we have identified genetic variants in TSC1 that decrease TSC1/hamartin levels and predispose to tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Cellular and murine models of TSC1 haploinsufficiency, as well as human brains carrying a TSC1 risk variant, accumulated tau protein that exhibited aberrant acetylation. This acetylation hindered tau degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy, thereby leading to its accumulation. Aberrant tau acetylation in TSC1 haploinsufficiency resulted from the dysregulation of both p300 acetyltransferase and SIRT1 deacetylase. Pharmacological modulation of either enzyme restored tau levels. This study substantiates TSC1 as a novel tauopathy risk gene and includes TSC1 haploinsufficiency as a genetic model for tauopathies. In addition, these findings promote tau acetylation as a rational target for tauopathy therapeutics and diagnostic.",Sci Adv,2021
34799679,Association between depression and the risk of Alzheimer's disease using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Elderly Cohort.,"In this cohort study, we assessed the association between depression and the risk of Alzheimer's disease from data obtained from the 2002 to 2013 Korean National Health Insurance Service-Elderly Cohort Database, which accounts for 10% of the South Korean population aged > 60 years. A total 518,466 patients were included in the analysis and followed up, unless they were excluded due to death or migration. Patients who sought treatment for depression or dementia within 1 year of the washout period and who were diagnosed with dementia within the 1-year period of the diagnosis of depression were excluded from the study. The risk of dementia was analysed using Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with a history of depression during the follow-up period were at a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease than those without a history of depression (HR 3.35, CI 3.27-3.42). The severe-depression group exhibited the highest risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR 4.41, CI 4.04-4.81), while the mild-depression group exhibited a relatively lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR 3.31, CI 3.16-3.47). The risk of Alzheimer's disease was associated with depression history and an increased severity of depression increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease.",Sci Rep,2021
34824300,Mechanism of quercetin therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Quercetin has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities, suggesting therapeutic potential against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, potential molecular targets of quercetin were first identified using the Swiss Target Prediction platform and pathogenic targets of T2DM and AD were identified using online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM), DisGeNET, TTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards databases. The 95 targets shared among quercetin, T2DM, and AD were used to establish a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, top 25 core genes, and protein functional modules using MCODE. Metascape was then used for gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. A protein functional module with best score was obtained from the PPI network using CytoHubba, and 6 high-probability quercetin targets (AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) were confirmed by docking simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out according to the molecular docking results. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the major shared mechanisms for T2DM and AD include ""AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,"" ""pathways in cancer,"" and ""MAPK signaling pathway"" (the key pathway). We speculate that quercetin may have therapeutic applications in T2DM and AD by targeting MAPK signaling, providing a theoretical foundation for future clinical research.",Sci Rep,2021
34759276,Comparative analysis of default mode networks in major psychiatric disorders using resting-state EEG.,"Default mode network (DMN) is a set of functional brain structures coherently activated when individuals are in resting-state. In this study, we constructed multi-frequency band resting-state EEG-based DMN functional network models for major psychiatric disorders to easily compare their pathophysiological characteristics. Phase-locking values (PLVs) were evaluated to quantify functional connectivity; global and nodal clustering coefficients (CCs) were evaluated to quantify global and local connectivity patterns of DMN nodes, respectively. DMNs of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia (SZ), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were constructed relative to their demographically-matched healthy control groups. Overall DMN patterns were then visualized and compared with each other. In global CCs, SZ and AD showed hyper-clustering in the theta band; OCD, MCI, and AD showed hypo-clustering in the low-alpha band; OCD and MDD showed hypo-clustering and hyper-clustering in low-beta, and high-beta bands, respectively. In local CCs, disease-specific patterns were observed. In the PLVs, lowered theta-band functional connectivity between the left lingual gyrus and the left hippocampus was frequently observed. Our comprehensive comparisons suggest EEG-based DMN as a useful vehicle for understanding altered brain networks of major psychiatric disorders.",Sci Rep,2021
34702870,Analysis of whole exome sequencing in severe mental illness hints at selection of brain development and immune related genes.,"Evolutionary trends may underlie some aspects of the risk for common, non-communicable disorders, including psychiatric disease. We analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 80 unique individuals from India coming from families with two or more individuals with severe mental illness. We used Population Branch Statistics (PBS) to identify variants and genes under positive selection and identified 74 genes as candidates for positive selection. Of these, 20 were previously associated with Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and cognitive abilities in genome wide association studies. We then checked whether any of these 74 genes were involved in common biological pathways or related to specific cellular or molecular functions. We found that immune related pathways and functions related to innate immunity such as antigen binding were over-represented. We also evaluated for the presence of Neanderthal introgressed segments in these genes and found Neanderthal introgression in a single gene out of the 74 candidate genes. However, the introgression pattern indicates the region is unlikely to be the source for selection. Our findings hint at how selection pressures in individuals from families with a history of severe mental illness may diverge from the general population. Further, it also provides insights into the genetic architecture of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia and its link to immune factors.",Sci Rep,2021
34961762,Patch individual filter layers in CNNs to harness the spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data.,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-as a type of deep learning-have been specifically designed for highly heterogeneous data, such as natural images. Neuroimaging data, however, is comparably homogeneous due to (1) the uniform structure of the brain and (2) additional efforts to spatially normalize the data to a standard template using linear and non-linear transformations. To harness spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data, we suggest here a new CNN architecture that combines the idea of hierarchical abstraction in CNNs with a prior on the spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data. Whereas early layers are trained globally using standard convolutional layers, we introduce patch individual filters (PIF) for higher, more abstract layers. By learning filters in individual latent space patches without sharing weights, PIF layers can learn abstract features faster and specific to regions. We thoroughly evaluated PIF layers for three different tasks and data sets, namely sex classification on UK Biobank data, Alzheimer's disease detection on ADNI data and multiple sclerosis detection on private hospital data, and compared it with two baseline models, a standard CNN and a patch-based CNN. We obtained two main results: First, CNNs using PIF layers converge consistently faster, measured in run time in seconds and number of iterations than both baseline models. Second, both the standard CNN and the PIF model outperformed the patch-based CNN in terms of balanced accuracy and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) with a maximal balanced accuracy (ROC AUC) of 94.21% (99.10%) for the sex classification task (PIF model), and 81.24% and 80.48% (88.89% and 87.35%) respectively for the Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis detection tasks (standard CNN model). In conclusion, we demonstrated that CNNs using PIF layers result in faster convergence while obtaining the same predictive performance as a standard CNN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces a prior in form of an inductive bias to harness spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data.",Sci Rep,2021
34644146,Microglial activation states drive glucose uptake and FDG-PET alterations in neurodegenerative diseases.,"2-Deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is widely used to study cerebral glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated whether the FDG-PET signal is directly influenced by microglial glucose uptake in mouse models and patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Using a recently developed approach for cell sorting after FDG injection, we found that, at cellular resolution, microglia displayed higher glucose uptake than neurons and astrocytes. Alterations in microglial glucose uptake were responsible for both the FDG-PET signal decrease in Trem2-deficient mice and the FDG-PET signal increase in mouse models for amyloidosis. Thus, opposite microglial activation states determine the differential FDG uptake. Consistently, 12 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 21 patients with four-repeat tauopathies also exhibited a positive association between glucose uptake and microglial activity as determined by <sup>18</sup>F-GE-180 18-kDa translocator protein PET (TSPO-PET) in preserved brain regions, indicating that the cerebral glucose uptake in humans is also strongly influenced by microglial activity. Our findings suggest that microglia activation states are responsible for FDG-PET signal alterations in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and mouse models for amyloidosis. Microglial activation states should therefore be considered when performing FDG-PET.",Sci Transl Med,2021
34759274,Mild behavioral impairment correlates of cognitive impairments in older adults without dementia: mediation by amyloid pathology.,"The relationship between mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intricate and still not well investigated. The purpose of the study is to examine the roles of the AD imaging pathologies in modulating the associations of MBI with cognitive impairments. We analyzed 1129 participants (563 [49.86%] female), who had measures of Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), cognition, and amyloid PET AD biomarkers from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We assess the longitudinal neuropathological and clinical correlates of baseline MBI via linear mixed effects and Cox proportional hazard models. The mediation analyses were used to test the mediation effects of AD pathologies on cognition. We found that MBI was associated with worse global cognition as represented by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p < 0.001), and higher β-amyloid burden (p < 0.001). β-amyloid partially mediated the effects of MBI on cognition with the mediation percentage varied from 14.67 to 40.86% for general cognition, memory, executive, and language functions for non-dementia individuals. However, no significant associations were discovered between MBI and tau burden or neurodegeneration. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses revealed that individuals with MBI had a faster increase in brain amyloid burden (p < 0.001) and a higher risk of clinical conversion (HR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.45 to 4.01 p < 0.001). In conclusion, MBI could be an imperative prediction indicator of clinical and pathological progression. In addition, amyloid pathologies might partially mediate the influences of MBI on cognitive impairments and AD risk.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
33446646,A cortical immune network map identifies distinct microglial transcriptional programs associated with β-amyloid and Tau pathologies.,"Microglial dysfunction has been proposed as one of the many cellular mechanisms that can contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, using a transcriptional network map of the human frontal cortex, we identify five modules of co-expressed genes related to microglia and assess their role in the neuropathologic features of AD in 540 subjects from two cohort studies of brain aging. Two of these transcriptional programs-modules 113 and 114-relate to the accumulation of β-amyloid, while module 5 relates to tau pathology. We replicate these associations in brain epigenomic data and in two independent datasets. In terms of tau, we propose that module 5, a marker of activated microglia, may lead to tau accumulation and subsequent cognitive decline. We validate our model further by showing that three representative module 5 genes (ACADVL, TRABD, and VASP) encode proteins that are upregulated in activated microglia in AD.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
34537810,Staging tau pathology with tau PET in Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study.,"A biological research framework to define Alzheimer' disease with dichotomized biomarker measurement was proposed by National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA). However, it cannot characterize the hierarchy spreading pattern of tau pathology. To reflect in vivo tau progression using biomarker, we constructed a refined topographic <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 tau PET staging scheme with longitudinal clinical validation. Seven hundred and thirty-four participants with baseline <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 tau PET (baseline age 73.9 ± 7.7 years, 375 female) were stratified into five stages by a topographic PET staging scheme. Cognitive trajectories and clinical progression were compared across stages with or without further dichotomy of amyloid status, using linear mixed-effect models and Cox proportional hazard models. Significant cognitive decline was first observed in stage 1 when tau levels only increased in transentorhinal regions. Rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression accelerated from stage 2 to stage 3 and stage 4. Higher stages were also associated with greater CSF phosphorylated tau and total tau concentrations from stage 1. Abnormal tau accumulation did not appear with normal β-amyloid in neocortical regions but prompt cognitive decline by interacting with β-amyloid in temporal regions. Highly accumulated tau in temporal regions independently led to cognitive deterioration. Topographic PET staging scheme have potentials in early diagnosis, predicting disease progression, and studying disease mechanism. Characteristic tau spreading pattern in Alzheimer's disease could be illustrated with biomarker measurement under NIA-AA framework. Clinical-neuroimaging-neuropathological studies in other cohorts are needed to validate these findings.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
33654092,Ethnic and trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies identify new loci influencing Japanese Alzheimer's disease risk.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has no cure, but early detection and risk prediction could allow earlier intervention. Genetic risk factors may differ between ethnic populations. To discover novel susceptibility loci of AD in the Japanese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 3962 AD cases and 4074 controls. Out of 4,852,957 genetic markers that passed stringent quality control filters, 134 in nine loci, including APOE and SORL1, were convincingly associated with AD. Lead SNPs located in seven novel loci were genotyped in an independent Japanese AD case-control cohort. The novel locus FAM47E reached genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis of association results. This is the first report associating the FAM47E locus with AD in the Japanese population. A trans-ethnic meta-analysis combining the results of the Japanese data sets with summary statistics from stage 1 data of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project identified an additional novel susceptibility locus in OR2B2. Our data highlight the importance of performing GWAS in non-European populations.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
34663799,Prefrontal Aβ pathology influencing the pathway from apathy to cognitive decline in non-dementia elderly.,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the complex connection between apathy and cognitive decline that remains unclear. A total of 1057 non-dementia elderly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database received up to 13 years of follow-up and were divided into an apathy negative (-) group of 943 participants and an apathy positive (+) group of 114 participants through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)-apathy subitem. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and amyloid β (Aβ) PET were measured, and their longitudinal changes were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Risk factors for cognitive decline and apathy conversion were explored through the Cox proportional hazards model. Mediation effects of Aβ pathology on cognition were investigated using the causal mediation analysis. Apathy syndrome was associated with faster impairment of cognition and elevation of the Aβ burden. The effects of apathy on cognitive function and life quality were mediated by Aβ pathology, including CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/total tau ratio, and Aβ deposition in the prefrontal regions. Apathy syndrome was the risk factor for cognitive deterioration; meanwhile, frontal Aβ burden was the risk factor for apathy conversion. Apathy syndrome is an early manifestation of cognitive decline and there are bidirectional roles between apathy syndrome and Aβ pathology. Prefrontal Aβ pathology influenced the pathway from apathy to cognitive decline.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
34354038,BRUCE silencing leads to axonal dystrophy by repressing autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Alzheimer's disease.,"Axonal dystrophy is a swollen and tortuous neuronal process that contributes to synaptic alterations occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous study identified that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) at the axon terminal and then the signal is propagated along the axon to the cell body and affects neuronal function through retrograde transport. Therefore, this study was designed to identify a microRNA (miRNA) that alters related components of the transport machinery to affect BDNF retrograde signaling deficits in AD. Hippocampus tissues were isolated from APP/PS1 transgenic (AD-model) mice and C57BL/6J wild-type mice and subject to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and immunohistochemical staining. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion and nuclear translocation of BDNF was detected using immunofluorescence in HT22 cells. The interaction among miR-204, BIR repeat containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (BRUCE) and Syntaxin 17 (STX17) was investigated using dual luciferase reporter gene assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. The expression of relevant genes and proteins were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Knockdown of STX17 or BRUCE inhibited autophagosome-lysosome fusion and impacted axon growth in HT22 cells. STX17 immunoprecipitating with BRUCE and co-localization of them demonstrated BRUCE interacted with STX17. BRUCE was the target of miR-204, and partial loss of miR-204 by inhibitor promoted autophagosome-lysosome fusion to prevent axon dystrophy and accumulated BDNF nuclear translocation to rescue BDNF/TrkB signaling deficits in HT22 cells. The overall results demonstrated that inhibition of miR-204 prevents axonal dystrophy by blocking BRUCE interaction with STX17, which unraveled potential novel therapeutic targets for delaying AD.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
34671017,Bilobalide inhibits inflammation and promotes the expression of Aβ degrading enzymes in astrocytes to rescue neuronal deficiency in AD models.,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves multiple cell types including endothelial cells, glia, and neurons. It suggests that therapy against single target in single cell type may not be sufficient to treat AD and therapies with protective effects in multiple cell types may be more effective. Here, we comprehensively investigated the effects of bilobalide on neuroinflammation and Aβ degrading enzymes in AD cell model and mouse model. We find that bilobalide inhibits Aβ-induced and STAT3-dependent expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in primary astrocyte culture. Bilobalide also induces robust expression of Aβ degrading enzymes like NEP, IDE, and MMP2 to facilitate astrocyte-mediated Aβ clearance. Moreover, bilobalide treatment of astrocyte rescues neuronal deficiency in co-cultured APP/PS1 neurons. Most importantly, bilobalide reduces amyloid and inflammation in AD mouse brain. Taken together, the protective effects of bilobalide in in vitro cultures were fully recapitulated in in vivo AD mouse model. Our study supports that bilobalide has therapeutic potential for AD treatment.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
36135933,The MK2 cascade mediates transient alteration in mGluR-LTD and spatial learning in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease.,"A key aim of Alzheimer disease research is to develop efficient therapies to prevent and/or delay the irreversible progression of cognitive impairments. Early deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) are associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta in rodent models of the disease; however, less is known about how mGluR-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is affected. In this study, we have found that mGluR-LTD is enhanced in the APP<sub>swe</sub> /PS1dE9 mouse at 7 but returns to wild-type levels at 13 months of age. This transient over-activation of mGluR signalling is coupled with impaired LTP and shifts the dynamic range of synapses towards depression. These alterations in synaptic plasticity are associated with an inability to utilize cues in a spatial learning task. The transient dysregulation of plasticity can be prevented by genetic deletion of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a substrate of p38 MAPK, demonstrating that manipulating the mGluR-p38 MAPK-MK2 cascade at 7 months can prevent the shift in synapse dynamic range. Our work reveals the MK2 cascade as a potential pharmacological target to correct the over-activation of mGluR signalling.",Aging Cell,2022
35962576,"Glucose derived carbon nanosphere (CSP) conjugated TTK21, an activator of the histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300, ameliorates amyloid-beta 1-42 induced deficits in plasticity and associativity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.","The master epigenetic regulator lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300/CBP plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. Recent evidence has shown that in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression level and function of p300/CBP are severely compromised, leading to altered gene expression causing pathological conditions. Here, we show that p300/CBP activation by a small-molecule TTK21, conjugated to carbon nanosphere (CSP) ameliorates Aβ-impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation, theta burst stimulation, and synaptic tagging/capture (STC). This functional rescue was correlated with CSP-TTK21-induced changes in transcription and translation. Mechanistically, we observed that the expression of a large number of synaptic plasticity- and memory-related genes was rescued, presumably by the restoration of p300/CBP mediated acetylation. Collectively, these results suggest that small-molecule activators of p300/CBP could be a potential therapeutic molecule for neurodegenerative diseases like AD.",Aging Cell,2022
35909315,p38α-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells ameliorate symptoms and pathology of APP-transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is pathologically characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) and microglia-dominated inflammatory activation in the brain. p38α-MAPK is activated in both neurons and microglia. How p38α-MAPK in microglia contributes to AD pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we conditionally knocked out p38α-MAPK in all myeloid cells or specifically in microglia of APP-transgenic mice, and examined animals for AD-associated pathologies (i.e., cognitive deficits, Aβ pathology, and neuroinflammation) and individual microglia for their inflammatory activation and Aβ internalization at different disease stages (e.g., at 4 and 9 months of age). Our experiments showed that p38α-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells were more effective than p38α-MAPK-deficient microglia in reducing cerebral Aβ and neuronal impairment in APP-transgenic mice. Deficiency of p38α-MAPK in myeloid cells inhibited inflammatory activation of individual microglia at 4 months but enhanced it at 9 months. Inflammatory activation promoted microglial internalization of Aβ. Interestingly, p38α-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells reduced IL-17a-expressing CD4-positive lymphocytes in 9 but not 4-month-old APP-transgenic mice. By cross-breeding APP-transgenic mice with Il-17a-knockout mice, we observed that IL-17a deficiency potentially activated microglia and reduced Aβ deposition in the brain as shown in 9-month-old myeloid p38α-MAPK-deficient AD mice. Thus, p38α-MAPK deficiency in all myeloid cells, but not only in microglia, prevents AD progression. IL-17a-expressing lymphocytes may partially mediate the pathogenic role of p38α-MAPK in peripheral myeloid cells. Our study supports p38α-MAPK as a therapeutic target for AD patients.",Aging Cell,2022
36354163,One-year Medicare costs associated with delirium in older hospitalized patients with and without Alzheimer's disease dementia and related disorders.,"INTRODUCTION: One-year health-care costs associated with delirium in older hospitalized patients with and without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have not been examined previously.
METHODS: Medicare costs were determined prospectively at discharge, and at 30, 90, and 365 days in a cohort (n = 311) of older adults after hospital admission.
RESULTS: Seventy-six (24%) patients had ADRD and were more likely to develop delirium (51% vs. 24%, P < 0.001) and die within 1 year (38% vs. 21%, P = 0.002). In ADRD patients with versus without delirium, adjusted mean difference in costs associated with delirium were $34,828; most of the excess costs were incurred between 90 and 365 days (P = 0.03). In non-ADRD patients, delirium was associated with increased costs at all timepoints. Excess costs associated with delirium in ADRD patients increased progressively over 1 year, whereas in non-ADRD patients the increase was consistent across time periods.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the complexity of health-care costs for ADRD patients who develop delirium, a potentially preventable source of expenditures.
HIGHLIGHTS: Novel examination of health-care costs of delirium in persons with and without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Increased 1-year costs of $34,828 in ADRD patients with delirium (vs. without). Increased costs for delirium in ADRD occur later during the 365-day study period. For ADRD patients, cost differences between those with and without delirium increased over 1 year. For non-ADRD patients, the parallel cost differences were consistent over time.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36448627,Microglial INPP5D limits plaque formation and glial reactivity in the PSAPP mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase D (INPP5D) gene encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that can dephosphorylate both phospholipids and phosphoproteins. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in INPP5D impact risk for developing late onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
METHODS: To assess the consequences of inducible Inpp5d knockdown in microglia of APP<sup>KM670/671NL</sup> /PSEN1<sup>Δexon9</sup> (PSAPP) mice, we injected 3-month-old Inpp5d<sup>fl/fl</sup> /Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup> and PSAPP/Inpp5d<sup>fl/fl</sup> /Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup> mice with either tamoxifen (TAM) or corn oil (CO) to induce recombination.
RESULTS: At age 6 months, we found that the percent area of 6E10<sup>+</sup> deposits and plaque-associated microglia in Inpp5d knockdown mice were increased compared to controls. Spatial transcriptomics identified a plaque-specific expression profile that was extensively altered by Inpp5d knockdown.
DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that conditional Inpp5d downregulation in the PSAPP mouse increases plaque burden and recruitment of microglia to plaques. Spatial transcriptomics highlighted an extended gene expression signature associated with plaques and identified CST7 (cystatin F) as a novel marker of plaques.
HIGHLIGHTS: Inpp5d knockdown increases plaque burden and plaque-associated microglia number. Spatial transcriptomics identifies an expanded plaque-specific gene expression profile. Plaque-induced gene expression is altered by Inpp5d knockdown in microglia. Our plaque-associated gene signature overlaps with human Alzheimer's disease gene networks.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36583449,"MGMT, a risk factor for both genetic and environmental forms of dementia.","MGMT, the gene coding for the DNA-repair protein O<sup>6</sup> -methylguanine methyltransferase, which has been recently shown to be a risk factor for inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), notably among women, might also be linked to Western Pacific amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC), one phenotype of which is an AD-like dementia. Guam ALS/PDC is strongly considered to be an environmental disorder caused by oral exposure to natural toxins (i.e., genotoxic/epigenotoxic chemicals), notably methylazoxymethanol (MAM) that alkylates guanine to form O<sup>6</sup> -methylguanine, found in the seed of cycad plants traditionally used for food. Thus, the DNA-repair protein MGMT might participate in both AD and in the AD-related disorder ALS/PDC.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36565459,Mayo-PACC: A parsimonious preclinical Alzheimer's disease cognitive composite comprised of public-domain measures to facilitate clinical translation.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to define a Mayo Preclinical Alzheimer's disease Cognitive Composite (Mayo-PACC) that prioritizes parsimony and use of public domain measures to facilitate clinical translation.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 65 to 85 at baseline with amyloid PET imaging were included, yielding 428 amyloid negative (A-) and 186 amyloid positive (A+) individuals with 7 years mean follow-up. Sensitivity to amyloid-related cognitive decline was examined using slope estimates derived from linear mixed models (difference in annualized change across A+ and A- groups). We compared differences in rates of change between Mayo-PACC and other composites (A+ > A- indicating more significant decline in A+).
RESULTS: All composites showed sensitivity to amyloid-related longitudinal cognitive decline (A+ > A- annualized change p < 0.05). Comparisons revealed that Mayo-PACC (AVLT sum of trials 1-5+6+delay, Trails B, animal fluency) showed comparable longitudinal sensitivity to other composites.
DISCUSSION: Mayo-PACC performs similarly to other composites and can be directly translated to the clinic.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36372959,Improving generalizability and study design of Alzheimer's disease cohort studies in the United States by including under-represented populations.,"The poor generalizability of clinical research data due to the enrollment of highly educated, non-Latinx White participants hampers the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Black and Latinx older adults have a greater risk for dementia, yet it is unclear how health-care disparities and sociocultural factors influence potential AD therapies and prognosis. Low enrollment of under-represented populations may be attributable to several factors including greater exclusion due to higher rates of comorbidities, lower access to AD clinics, and the legacy of unethical treatment in medical research. This perspective outlines solutions tested in the Brain Health Registry (BHR) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including culturally-informed digital research methods, community-engaged research strategies, leadership from under-represented communities, and the reduction of exclusion criteria based on comorbidities. Our successes demonstrate that it is possible to increase the inclusion and engagement of under-represented populations into US-based clinical studies, thereby increasing the generalizability of their results.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36373344,A public resource of baseline data from the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer's Disease Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (API ADAD) Trial evaluated the anti-oligomeric amyloid beta (Aβ) antibody therapy crenezumab in cognitively unimpaired members of the Colombian presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A kindred. We report availability, methods employed to protect confidentiality and anonymity of participants, and process for requesting and accessing baseline data.
METHODS: We developed mechanisms to share baseline data from the API ADAD Trial in consultation with experts and other groups sharing data from Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention trials, balancing the need to protect anonymity and trial integrity with making data broadly available to accelerate progress in the field. We pressure-tested deliberate and inadvertent potential threats under specific assumptions, employed a system to suppress or mask both direct and indirect identifying variables, limited and firewalled data managers, and put forth specific principles requisite to receive data.
RESULTS: Baseline demographic, PSEN1 E280A and apolipoprotein E genotypes, florbetapir and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, clinical, and cognitive data can now be requested by interested researchers.
DISCUSSION: Baseline data are publicly available; treatment data and biological samples, including baseline and treatment-related blood-based biomarker data will become available in accordance with our original trial agreement and subsequently developed Collaboration for Alzheimer's Prevention principles. Sharing of these data will allow exploration of important questions including the differential effects of initiating an investigational AD prevention therapy both before as well as after measurable Aβ plaque deposition.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36327171,The effect of race and co-morbidities on Alzheimer's disease based on Medicare data.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence is thought to be higher among Black than White individuals.
METHODS: We studied the US Medicare population from 2000 to 2018. Cox regression was used to determine the roles of race and co-morbidities for AD incidence.
RESULTS: We studied 11,880,906 Medicare beneficiaries, with 774,548 AD cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) by increasing numbers of co-morbidities (1-7) were 1.51, 2.00, 2.55, 3.16, 2.89, 4.77, and 5.65. Among those with no co-morbidities, Black individuals had a lower rate than those who are White (HR = 0.69), while among those with one more co-morbidities, Black individuals had a higher rate (HR = 1.19). The presence of hypertension increased AD rates by 14% for White individuals, but 69% for those who are Black.
DISCUSSION: More co-morbidities was strongly associated with higher AD rates. The higher rates for Black versus White individuals was apparent only for those with co-morbidities and appears driven both by more co-morbidities, and the greater effect of hypertension.
HIGHLIGHTS: Black individuals have been shown to have higher Alzheimer's disease (AD) rates than those who are White. Some co-morbidities are known to increase AD risk. Among those In Medicare data with no co-morbidities, Black individuals have less risk than those who are White. Among those with co-morbidities, Black individuals have higher rates than those who are White. Hypertension results in a much stronger increase in AD risk for Black versus White individuals.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36370135,Reduced synaptic proteins and SNARE complexes in Down syndrome with Alzheimer's disease and the Dp16 mouse Down syndrome model: Impact of APP gene dose.,"INTRODUCTION: Synaptic failure, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is correlated with reduced levels of synaptic proteins. Though people with Down syndrome (DS) are at markedly increased risk for AD (AD-DS), few studies have addressed synapse dysfunction.
METHODS: Synaptic proteins were measured in the frontal cortex of DS, AD-DS, sporadic AD cases, and controls. The same proteins were examined in the Dp16 model of DS.
RESULTS: A common subset of synaptic proteins were reduced in AD and AD-DS, but not in DS or a case of partial trisomy 21 lacking triplication of APP gene. Pointing to compromised synaptic function, the reductions in AD and AD-DS were correlated with reduced SNARE complexes. In Dp16 mice reductions in syntaxin 1A, SNAP25 and the SNARE complex recapitulated findings in AD-DS; reductions were impacted by both age and increased App gene dose.
DISCUSSION: Synaptic phenotypes shared between AD-DS and AD point to shared pathogenetic mechanisms.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36547260,Synaptic resilience is associated with maintained cognition during ageing.,"INTRODUCTION: It remains unclear why age increases risk of Alzheimer's disease and why some people experience age-related cognitive decline in the absence of dementia. Here we test the hypothesis that resilience to molecular changes in synapses contribute to healthy cognitive ageing.
METHODS: We examined post-mortem brain tissue from people in mid-life (n = 15), healthy ageing with either maintained cognition (n = 9) or lifetime cognitive decline (n = 8), and Alzheimer's disease (n = 13). Synapses were examined with high resolution imaging, proteomics, and RNA sequencing. Stem cell-derived neurons were challenged with Alzheimer's brain homogenate.
RESULTS: Synaptic pathology increased, and expression of genes involved in synaptic signaling decreased between mid-life, healthy ageing and Alzheimer's. In contrast, brain tissue and neurons from people with maintained cognition during ageing exhibited decreases in synaptic signaling genes compared to people with cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: Efficient synaptic networks without pathological protein accumulation may contribute to maintained cognition during ageing.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36335579,"Fragmentation of rest periods, astrocyte activation, and cognitive decline in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Sleep disruption is associated with astrocyte activation and impaired cognition in model organisms. However, the relationship among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition in humans is uncertain.
METHODS: We used RNA-seq to quantify the prefrontal cortex expression of a panel of human activated astrocyte marker genes in 1076 older adults in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, 411 of whom had multi-day actigraphy prior to death. We related this to rest fragmentation, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, and to longitudinal cognitive function.
RESULTS: Fragmentation of rest periods was associated with higher expression of activated astrocyte marker genes, which was associated with a lower level and faster decline of cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Astrocyte activation and fragmented rest are associated with each other and with accelerated cognitive decline. If experimental studies confirm a causal relationship, targeting sleep fragmentation and astrocyte activation may benefit cognition in older adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: Greater fragmentation of rest periods, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, is associated with higher composite expression of a panel of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes. Increased expression of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes was associated with a lower level and more rapid decline of cognitive function, beyond that accounted for by the burden of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to delineate the causal relationships among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36469008,The electrophysiological and neuropathological profiles of cerebellum in APP<sup>swe</sup> /PS1<sup>ΔE9</sup> mice: A hypothesis on the role of cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease.,"We propose the hypothesis that the cerebellar electrophysiology and sleep-wake cycles may be altered at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), proceeding the amyloid-β neuropathological hallmarks. The electrophysiologic characteristics of cerebellum thereby might be served as a biomarker in the prepathological detection of AD. Sleep disturbances are common in preclinical AD patients, and the cerebellum has been implicated in sleep-wake regulation by several pioneer studies. Additionally, recent studies suggest that the structure and function of the cerebellum may be altered at the early stages of AD, indicating that the cerebellum may be involved in the disease's progression. We used APP<sup>swe</sup> /PS1<sup>ΔE9</sup> mice as a model of AD, monitored and analyzed electroencephalogram data, and assessed neuropathological profiles in the cerebellum of AD mice. Our hypothesis may establish a linkage between the cerebellum and AD, thereby potentially providing new perspectives on the pathogenesis of the disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36419215,Identification of causal effects of neuroanatomy on cognitive decline requires modeling unobserved confounders.,"INTRODUCTION: Carrying out a randomized controlled trial to estimate the causal effects of regional brain atrophy due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is impossible. Instead, we must estimate causal effects from observational data. However, this generally requires knowing and having recorded all confounders, which is often unrealistic.
METHODS: We provide an approach that leverages the dependencies among multiple neuroanatomical measures to estimate causal effects from observational neuroimaging data without the need to know and record all confounders.
RESULTS: Our analyses of  N = 732 $N=732$  subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative demonstrate that using our approach results in biologically meaningful conclusions, whereas ignoring unobserved confounding yields results that conflict with established knowledge on cognitive decline due to AD.
DISCUSSION: The findings provide evidence that the impact of unobserved confounding can be substantial. To ensure trustworthy scientific insights, future AD research can account for unobserved confounding via the proposed approach.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36465055,Cerebrospinal fluid irisin and lipoxin A4 are reduced in elderly Brazilian individuals with depression: Insight into shared mechanisms between depression and dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Depression is frequent among older adults and is a risk factor for dementia. Identifying molecular links between depression and dementia is necessary to shed light on shared disease mechanisms. Reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuroinflammation are implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and dementia. The exercise-induced hormone, irisin, increases BDNF and improves cognition in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Lipoxin A4 is a lipid mediator with anti-inflammatory activity. However, the roles of irisin and lipoxin A4 in depression remain to be determined.
METHODS: In the present study, blood and CSF were collected from 61 elderly subjects, including individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Screening for symptoms of depression was performed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15).
RESULTS: CSF irisin and lipoxin A4 were positively correlated and reduced, along with a trend of BDNF reduction, in elderly individuals with depression, similar to previous observations in patients with dementia.
DISCUSSION: Our findings provide novel insight into shared molecular signatures connecting depression and dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
36324157,Plasma amyloid-beta oligomer is related to subjective cognitive decline and brain amyloid status.,"BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a target for Alzheimer's disease prediction. Plasma amyloid-beta oligomer (AβO), the pathogenic form of Aβ in blood, has recently been proposed as a novel blood-based biomarker of AD prediction by representing brain Aβ deposition. The relationship between plasma AβO, brain Aβ deposition, and SCD in individuals with normal objective cognition has not been investigated.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 126 participants with normal objective cognition. More SCD symptoms were expressed as higher scores of the Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCDQ) and Memory Age-associated Complaint Questionnaire (MACQ). The plasma AβO level of each participant was measured twice for validation and expressed as a concentration (ng/mL) and a ratio relative to the mean value of two internal standards. Brain Aβ deposition was assessed by [<sup>18</sup>F] flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET) and expressed as standard uptake value ratio (SUVR). Associations of SCDQ and MACQ with plasma AβO levels or SUVR were analyzed in multiple linear regression models. The association between plasma AβO level and flutemetamol PET positivity was assessed in logistic regression and receiver operative characteristic analyses.
RESULTS: Overall, participants were 73.3 years old with female predominance (69.0%). After adjustment for confounders, high SCDQ and MACQ scores were associated with the high plasma AβO levels as both concentrations and ratios (ratios: standardized coefficient = 0.246 and p = 0.023 for SCDQ, standardized coefficient = 0.209 and p = 0.029 for MACQ; concentrations: standardized coefficient = 0.257 and p = 0.015 for SCDQ, standardized coefficient = 0.217 and p = 0.021 for MACQ). In contrast, SCDQ and MACQ were not significantly associated with SUVRs (p = 0.134 for SCDQ, p = 0.079 for MACQ). High plasma AβO levels were associated with flutemetamol PET (+) with an area under the curve of 0.694 (ratio) or 0.662 (concentration). Combined with APOE e4, plasma AβO presented area under the curves of 0.789 (ratio) and 0.783 (concentration).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the high plasma AβO level could serve as a potential surrogate biomarker of severe SCD and the presence of brain Aβ deposition in individuals with normal objective cognition.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36329512,Blood-based lipidomic signature of severe obstructive sleep apnoea in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the most frequent form of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Available evidence demonstrates that both conditions are independently associated with alterations in lipid metabolism. However, it is unknown whether the expression of lipids is different between AD patients with and without severe OSA. In this context, we examined the plasma lipidome of patients with suspected OSA, aiming to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers and to provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease.
METHODS: The study included 103 consecutive patients from the memory unit of our institution with a diagnosis of AD. The individuals were subjected to overnight polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose severe OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index ≥30/h), and blood was collected the following morning. Untargeted plasma lipidomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: We identified a subset of 44 lipids (mainly phospholipids and glycerolipids) that were expressed differently between patients with AD and severe and nonsevere OSA. Among the lipids in this profile, 30 were significantly correlated with specific PSG measures of OSA severity related to sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia. Machine learning analyses revealed a 4-lipid signature (phosphatidylcholine PC(35:4), cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid and two oxidized triglycerides (OxTG(58:5) and OxTG(62:12)) that provided an accuracy (95% CI) of 0.78 (0.69-0.86) in the detection of OSA. These same lipids improved the predictive power of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) from 0.61 (0.50-0.74) to 0.80 (0.70-0.90).
CONCLUSION: Our results show a plasma lipidomic fingerprint that allows the identification of patients with AD and severe OSA, allowing the personalized management of these individuals. The findings suggest that oxidative stress and inflammation are potential prominent mechanisms underlying the association between OSA and AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36348410,Driving assessment in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: progress to date and the path forward.,"BACKGROUND: Changes in driving behaviour may start at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where the underlying AD biological process has begun in the presence of cognitive normality. Here, we summarize the emerging evidence suggesting that preclinical AD may impact everyday driving behaviour. MAIN: Increasing evidence links driving performance and behaviour with AD biomarkers in cognitively intact older adults. These studies have found subtle yet detectable differences in driving associated with AD biomarker status among cognitively intact older adults.
CONCLUSION: Recent studies suggest that changes in driving, a highly complex activity, are linked to, and can indicate the presence of, neuropathological AD. Future research must now examine the internal and external validity of driving for widespread use in identifying biological AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36529757,"Persisting neuropsychiatric symptoms, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebrospinal fluid cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.","INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are important treatment targets in the management of dementia and can be present at very early clinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Increased cortisol has been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been associated with faster cognitive decline. Elevated cortisol output has been observed in relation to perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has known anti-glucocorticoid effects and may counter the effects of cortisol.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine whether CSF cortisol and DHEAS levels were associated with (1) neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline, (2) changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms over 3 years, and (3) whether these associations were related to or independent of AD pathology.
METHODS: One hundred and eighteen participants on a prospective study in a memory clinic setting, including patients with cognitive impairment (n = 78), i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, and volunteers with normal cognition (n = 40), were included. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). CSF cortisol and DHEAS, as well as CSF AD biomarkers, were obtained at baseline. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were re-assessed at follow-up visits 18 and 36 months from baseline. We constructed linear regression models to examine the links between baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms, the presence of AD pathology as indicated by CSF biomarkers, and CSF cortisol and DHEAS. We used repeated-measures mixed ANCOVA models to examine the associations between the neuropsychiatric symptoms' changes over time, baseline CSF cortisol and DHEAS, and AD pathology.
RESULTS: Higher CSF cortisol was associated with higher NPI-Q severity scores at baseline after controlling for covariates including AD pathology status (B = 0.085 [0.027; 0.144], p = 0.027; r = 0.277). In particular, higher CSF cortisol was associated with higher baseline scores of depression/dysphoria, anxiety, and apathy/indifference. Elevated CSF cortisol was also associated with more marked increase in NPI-Q scores over time regardless of AD status (p = 0.036, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.207), but this association was no longer significant after controlling for BMI and the use of psychotropic medications. CSF DHEAS was associated neither with NPI-Q scores at baseline nor with their change over time. Cortisol did not mediate the association between baseline NPI-Q and changes in clinical dementia rating sum of boxes over 36 months.
CONCLUSION: Higher CSF cortisol may reflect or contribute to more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline, as well as more pronounced worsening over 3 years, independently of the presence of AD pathology. Our findings also suggest that interventions targeting the HPA axis may be helpful to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36581943,A low-dimensional cognitive-network space in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show network dysfunctions linked with cognitive deficits. Within this framework, network abnormalities between AD and FTD show both convergent and divergent patterns. However, these functional patterns are far from being established and their relevance to cognitive processes remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: We investigated the relationship between cognition and functional connectivity of major cognitive networks in these diseases. Twenty-three bvFTD (age: 71±10), 22 AD (age: 72±6), and 20 controls (age: 72±6) underwent cognitive evaluation and resting-state functional MRI. Principal component analysis was used to describe cognitive variance across participants. Brain network connectivity was estimated with connectome analysis. Connectivity matrices were created assessing correlations between parcels within each functional network. The following cognitive networks were considered: default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks. The relationship between cognition and connectivity was assessed using a bootstrapping correlation and interaction analyses.
RESULTS: Three principal cognitive components explained more than 80% of the cognitive variance: the first component (cogPC1) loaded on memory, the second component (cogPC2) loaded on emotion and language, and the third component (cogPC3) loaded on the visuo-spatial and attentional domains. Compared to HC, AD and bvFTD showed impairment in all cogPCs (p<0.002), and bvFTD scored worse than AD in cogPC2 (p=0.031). At the network level, the DMN showed a significant association in the whole group with cogPC1 and cogPC2 and the VAN with cogPC2. By contrast, DAN and FPN showed a divergent pattern between diagnosis and connectivity for cogPC2. We confirmed these results by means of a multivariate analysis (canonical correlation).
CONCLUSIONS: A low-dimensional representation can account for a large variance in cognitive scores in the continuum from normal to pathological aging. Moreover, cognitive components showed both convergent and divergent patterns with connectivity across AD and bvFTD. The convergent pattern was observed across the networks primarily involved in these diseases (i.e., the DMN and VAN), while a divergent FC-cognitive pattern was mainly observed between attention/executive networks and the language/emotion cognitive component, suggesting the co-existence of compensatory and detrimental mechanisms underlying these components.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36482412,Consistency of efficacy results across various clinical measures and statistical methods in the lecanemab phase 2 trial of early Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Lecanemab (BAN2401) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (protofibrils) with activity at insoluble fibrils and slowed clinical decline in an 18-month phase 2 proof-of-concept study (Study 201; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01767311) in 856 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this trial, subjects were randomized to five lecanemab dose regimens or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) at 12 months with Bayesian analyses. The key secondary endpoints were ADCOMS at 18 months and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14) at 18 months. The results have been published previously. Herein, we describe the results of sensitivity analyses evaluating the consistency of the lecanemab efficacy results in Study 201 at the identified dose, the ED90, across multiple statistical methods and multiple endpoints over the duration of the study.
METHODS: The protocol-specified analysis model was a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Sensitivity analyses address the consistency of the conclusions using multiple statistical methods. These include a disease progression model (DPM), a natural cubic spline (NCS) model, a quadratic mixed model (QMM), and 2 MMRMs with additional covariates.
RESULTS: The sensitivity analyses showed positive lecanemab treatment effects for all endpoints and all statistical models considered. The protocol-specified ADCOMS analysis showed a 29.7% slower decline than placebo for ADCOMS at 18 months. The various other analyses of 3 key endpoints showed declines ranging from 26.5 to 55.9%. The results at 12 months are also consistent with those at 18 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion of the primary analysis of the lecanemab Study 201 is strengthened by the consistently positive conclusions across multiple statistical models, across efficacy endpoints, and over time, despite missing data. The 18-month data from this trial was utilized in the design of the confirmatory phase 3 trial (Clarity AD) and allowed for proper powering for multiple, robust outcomes.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36581949,Subjective cognitive decline is a better marker for future cognitive decline in females than in males.,"BACKGROUND: The identification of biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical to the development of therapies and interventions targeted at symptom management and tracking the pathophysiology of disease. The endorsement of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has emerged as a potential indicator of early change in cognitive status that may be predictive of future impairment at a time when measurable declines in neuropsychological performance cannot be detected. While there are numerous findings revealing sex differences in the prevalence of AD, there is a paucity of research examining sex differences in SCD. Therefore, the goal of this project was to determine if the relationship between the endorsement of SCD and future cognitive changes differ as a function of biological sex.
METHODS: A sample of 3019 male and female healthy older adults (2188 without SCD, 831 with SCD), with a mean follow-up time of 5.7 years, were included from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center Research Sharing Hub. Linear regressions were performed to determine group differences in baseline cognitive scores, while linear mixed-effects models were completed to determine group differences in the rate of cognitive change over time.
RESULTS: Individuals endorsing SCD had significantly lower baseline cognitive scores and increased rates of decline in all cognitive domains compared to those without SCD. Males exhibited significantly lower scores in baseline performance in global cognition, episodic memory, and perceptual speed regardless of SCD classification. Females with SCD were found to decline at significantly faster rates than both males with SCD and males and females without SCD in all cognitive domains over a maximum 15-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: SCD is related to lower baseline cognitive performance and faster cognitive decline compared to those who do not endorse SCD. Females with SCD have the fastest rate of decline suggesting that SCD may be more predictive of future decline in females than in males. Targeted assessments of SCD may allow for the identification of individuals for inclusion in intervention trials, and other research studies, aiming to attenuate casual disease processes, which may ultimately aid in the mitigation of sex disparities in AD.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36371267,Budget impact analysis of the use of Souvenaid in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's Disease in Spain.,"INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the use of Souvenaid for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been previously evidenced. To complete the economic analysis, there is a need to assess whether society can afford it. The objective of this study was to carry out a budget impact analysis of the use of Souvenaid in Spain under the conditions of the LipiDidiet clinical trial from a societal perspective.
METHODS: We built a population model that took into account all the cohorts of individuals with AD, their individual progression, and the potential impact of Souvenaid treatment on their trajectories. Patient progression data were obtained from mixed models. The target population was estimated based on the population forecast for 2020-2035 and the incidence of dementia. Individual progression to dementia measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes was reproduced using mixed models. Besides the costs of treatment and diagnosis, direct costs of medical and non-medical care and indirect costs were included.
RESULTS: The epidemiological indicators and the distribution of life expectancy by stages validated the model. From the third year (2022), the differences in the cost of dementia offset the incremental cost of diagnosis and treatment. The costs of dependency reached €500 million/year while those of the intervention were limited to €40 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Souvenaid, with modest effectiveness in delaying dementia associated with AD, achieved a positive economic balance between costs and savings. Its use in the treatment of prodromal AD would imply an initial cost that would be ongoing, but this would be offset by savings in the care system for dependency associated with dementia from the third year. These results were based on adopting a societal perspective taking into account the effect of treatment on the use of health, social, and family resources.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2022
36538409,Safety and efficacy of plasma transfusion from exercise-trained donors in patients with early Alzheimer's disease: protocol for the ExPlas study.,"INTRODUCTION: Given that exercise training reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), induces changes in the blood composition and has widespread systemic benefits, it is reasonable to hypothesise that exercised plasma (ExPlas) may have rejuvenative properties. The main objective is to test safety and tolerability of transfusing ExPlas from young, healthy, fit adults to patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD. The study is a pilot for a future efficacy study. The key secondary objectives are examining the effect of plasma transfusions on cognitive function, fitness level, vascular risk profile, assessment of cerebral blood flow and hippocampal volume, quality of life, functional connectivity assessed by resting state functional MRI and biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: ExPlas is a double-blinded, randomised controlled clinical single-centre trial. Patients up to 75 years of age with diagnosis early symptomatic phase AD will be recruited from two Norwegian hospitals. ExPlas is plasma drawn by plasmapheresis once a month for 4 months, from a total of 30 fit male donors (aged 18-40, BMI≤27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and maximal oxygen uptake&gt;55 mL/kg/min). All units will be virus inactivated by the Intercept method in accordance with procedures at St. Olavs University Hospital. Comparison with isotonic saline allows differentiation from a non-blood product. The main study consists of 6 rounds of examinations in addition to 12 plasma transfusions divided over three 4-week periods during study year-1. It is also planned to conduct follow-up examinations 2 and 5 years after baseline ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants and participation is voluntary. All participants have a next of kin who will follow them throughout the study to represent the patient's interest. The study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK 2018/702) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency (EudraCT No. 2018-000148-24). The study will be published in an open access journal and results will be presented at numerous national and international meetings as well as on social media platforms.

35157023,MOMA: a multi-task attention learning algorithm for multi-omics data interpretation and classification.,"MOTIVATION: Accurate diagnostic classification and biological interpretation are important in biology and medicine, which are data-rich sciences. Thus, integration of different data types is necessary for the high predictive accuracy of clinical phenotypes, and more comprehensive analyses for predicting the prognosis of complex diseases are required.
RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel multi-task attention learning algorithm for multi-omics data, termed MOMA, which captures important biological processes for high diagnostic performance and interpretability. MOMA vectorizes features and modules using a geometric approach and focuses on important modules in multi-omics data via an attention mechanism. Experiments using public data on Alzheimer's disease and cancer with various classification tasks demonstrated the superior performance of this approach. The utility of MOMA was also verified using a comparison experiment with an attention mechanism that was turned on or off and biological analysis.

36552165,The Discourse Profile in Corticobasal Syndrome: A Comprehensive Clinical and Biomarker Approach.,"The aim of this study was to characterize the oral discourse of CBS patients and to verify whether measures obtained during a semi-spontaneous speech production could differentiate CBS patients from controls. A second goal was to compare the performance of patients with CBS probably due to Alzheimer's disease (CBS-AD) pathology and CBS not related to AD (CBS-non-AD) in the same measures, based on the brain metabolic status (FDG-PET) and in the presence of amyloid deposition (amyloid-PET). Results showed that CBS patients were significantly different from controls in speech rate, lexical level, informativeness, and syntactic complexity. Discursive measures did not differentiate CBS-AD from CBS-non-AD. However, CBS-AD displayed more lexical-semantic impairments than controls, a profile that is frequently reported in patients with clinical AD and the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA). CBS-non-AD presented mainly with impairments related to motor speech disorders and syntactic complexity, as seen in the non-fluent variant of PPA.",Brain Sci,2022
35702342,Effect of Time to Detection on the Measured Concentrations of Blood Proteins Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: For assays using immunomagnetic reduction, a reagent composed of antibody-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles is dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline solution. The real-time signals of alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibility, χ<sub>ac</sub>, of the reagent are subsequently recorded after mixing the reagent with a biofluid sample. After mixing the reagent and sample, the reduction in χ<sub>ac</sub> of the mixture is calculated and used to quantify the concentration of the target biomarker in the sample. The reduction does not occur immediately but rather occurs at some time after mixing. This observation implies that the time elapsed before recording the real-time signals of χ<sub>ac</sub> of a reagent-sample mixture needs to be investigated to ensure that the signals are fully recorded. In this work, the effect of time to detection on the measured concentrations of proteins in human plasma after mixing the reagent and sample is examined.
METHODS: The proteins analyzed are related to Alzheimer's disease: amyloid β 1-40, amyloid β 1-42, and Tau protein. The investigated times to detection after the mixing the reagent and sample are 0, 20, 30, 40, and 120 min.
RESULTS: The results show that the recording of real-time signals of χ<sub>ac</sub> should be conducted within 20 min after mixing the reagent and sample.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra,2022
36346209,High-frequency oscillations (250-500 Hz) in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and two animal models of epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 250 and 500 Hz occur in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus are not unique to epilepsy.
METHODS: Experiments were conducted in three mouse models of AD: Tg2576 mice that simulate a form of familial AD, presenilin 2 knock-out (PS2KO) mice, and the Ts65Dn model of Down's syndrome. We recorded HFOs using wideband (0.1-500 Hz, 2 kHz) intra-hippocampal and cortical surface electroencephalography (EEG) at 1 month until 24 months of age during wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, interictal spikes (IISs) and seizures were analyzed for the possible presence of HFOs. Comparisons were made to the intra-hippocampal kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epilepsy.
RESULTS: We describe for the first time that hippocampal and cortical HFOs are a new EEG abnormality in AD mouse models. HFOs occurred in all transgenic mice but no controls. They were also detectable as early as 1 month of age and prior to amyloid beta plaque neuropathology. HFOs were most frequent during SWS (vs REM sleep or wakefulness). Notably, HFOs in the AD and epilepsy models were indistinguishable in both spectral frequency and duration. HFOs also occurred during IISs and seizures in the AD models, although with altered spectral properties compared to isolated HFOs.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that HFOs, an epilepsy biomarker with high translational value, are not unique to epilepsy and thus not disease specific. Our findings also strengthen the idea of hyperexcitability in AD and its significant overlap with epilepsy. HFOs in AD mouse models may serve as an EEG biomarker, which is detectable from the scalp and thus amenable to noninvasive detection in people at risk for AD.",Epilepsia,2022
36910862,Patterns of structure-function association in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease: Screening for mild cognitive impairment and dementia with ML regression and classification models.,"BACKGROUND: The combined analysis of imaging and functional modalities is supposed to improve diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases with advanced data science techniques.
OBJECTIVE: To get an insight into normal and accelerated brain aging by developing the machine learning models that predict individual performance in neuropsychological and cognitive tests from brain MRI. With these models we endeavor to look for patterns of brain structure-function association (SFA) indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the age-related variability of cognitive and neuropsychological test scores in normal and accelerated aging and constructed regression models predicting functional performance in cognitive tests from brain radiomics data. The models were trained on the three study cohorts from ADNI dataset-cognitively normal individuals, patients with MCI or dementia-separately. We also looked for significant correlations between cortical parcellation volumes and test scores in the cohorts to investigate neuroanatomical differences in relation to cognitive status. Finally, we worked out an approach for the classification of the examinees according to the pattern of structure-function associations into the cohorts of the cognitively normal elderly and patients with MCI or dementia.
RESULTS: In the healthy population, the global cognitive functioning slightly changes with age. It also remains stable across the disease course in the majority of cases. In healthy adults and patients with MCI or dementia, the trendlines of performance in digit symbol substitution test and trail making test converge at the approximated point of 100 years of age. According to the SFA pattern, we distinguish three cohorts: the cognitively normal elderly, patients with MCI, and dementia. The highest accuracy is achieved with the model trained to predict the mini-mental state examination score from voxel-based morphometry data. The application of the majority voting technique to models predicting results in cognitive tests improved the classification performance up to 91.95% true positive rate for healthy participants, 86.21%-for MCI and 80.18%-for dementia cases.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning model, when trained on the cases of this of that group, describes a disease-specific SFA pattern. The pattern serves as a ""stamp"" of the disease reflected by the model.",Front Aging Neurosci,2022
35260199,A neurodegenerative disease landscape of rare mutations in Colombia due to founder effects.,"BACKGROUND: The Colombian population, as well as those in other Latin American regions, arose from a recent tri-continental admixture among Native Americans, Spanish invaders, and enslaved Africans, all of whom passed through a population bottleneck due to widespread infectious diseases that left small isolated local settlements. As a result, the current population reflects multiple founder effects derived from diverse ancestries.
METHODS: We characterized the role of admixture and founder effects on the origination of the mutational landscape that led to neurodegenerative disorders under these historical circumstances. Genomes from 900 Colombian individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [n = 376], frontotemporal lobar degeneration-motor neuron disease continuum (FTLD-MND) [n = 197], early-onset dementia not otherwise specified (EOD) [n = 73], and healthy participants [n = 254] were analyzed. We examined their global and local ancestry proportions and screened this cohort for deleterious variants in disease-causing and risk-conferring genes.
RESULTS: We identified 21 pathogenic variants in AD-FTLD related genes, and PSEN1 harbored the majority (11 pathogenic variants). Variants were identified from all three continental ancestries. TREM2 heterozygous and homozygous variants were the most common among AD risk genes (102 carriers), a point of interest because the disease risk conferred by these variants differed according to ancestry. Several gene variants that have a known association with MND in European populations had FTLD phenotypes on a Native American haplotype. Consistent with founder effects, identity by descent among carriers of the same variant was frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: Colombian demography with multiple mini-bottlenecks probably enhanced the detection of founder events and left a proportionally higher frequency of rare variants derived from the ancestral populations. These findings demonstrate the role of genomically defined ancestry in phenotypic disease expression, a phenotypic range of different rare mutations in the same gene, and further emphasize the importance of inclusiveness in genetic studies.",Genome Med,2022
35332097,A hidden layer of structural variation in transposable elements reveals potential genetic modifiers in human disease-risk loci.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been highly informative in discovering disease-associated loci but are not designed to capture all structural variations in the human genome. Using long-read sequencing data, we discovered widespread structural variation within SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) elements, a class of great ape-specific transposable elements with gene-regulatory roles, which represents a major source of structural variability in the human population. We highlight the presence of structurally variable SVAs (SV-SVAs) in neurological disease-associated loci, and we further associate SV-SVAs to disease-associated SNPs and differential gene expression using luciferase assays and expression quantitative trait loci data. Finally, we genetically deleted SV-SVAs in the BIN1 and CD2AP Alzheimer's disease-associated risk loci and in the BCKDK Parkinson's disease-associated risk locus and assessed multiple aspects of their gene-regulatory influence in a human neuronal context. Together, this study reveals a novel layer of genetic variation in transposable elements that may contribute to identification of the structural variants that are the actual drivers of disease associations of GWAS loci.",Genome Res,2022
35640139,Identifying candidate genes and drug targets for Alzheimer's disease by an integrative network approach using genetic and brain region-specific proteomic data.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 75 genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (ad). However, how these variants function and impact protein expression in brain regions remain elusive. Large-scale proteomic datasets of ad postmortem brain tissues have become available recently. In this study, we used these datasets to investigate brain region-specific molecular pathways underlying ad pathogenesis and explore their potential drug targets. We applied our new network-based tool, Edge-Weighted Dense Module Search of GWAS (EW_dmGWAS), to integrate ad GWAS statistics of 472 868 individuals with proteomic profiles from two brain regions from two large-scale ad cohorts [parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), sample size n = 190; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), n = 192]. The resulting network modules were evaluated using a scale-free network index, followed by a cross-region consistency evaluation. Our EW_dmGWAS analyses prioritized 52 top module genes (TMGs) specific in PHG and 58 TMGs in DLPFC, of which four genes (CLU, PICALM, PRRC2A and NDUFS3) overlapped. Those four genes were significantly associated with ad (GWAS gene-level false discovery rate < 0.05). To explore the impact of these genetic components on TMGs, we further examined their differentially co-expressed genes at the proteomic level and compared them with investigational drug targets. We pinpointed three potential drug target genes, APP, SNCA and VCAM1, specifically in PHG. Gene set enrichment analyses of TMGs in PHG and DLPFC revealed region-specific biological processes, tissue-cell type signatures and enriched drug signatures, suggesting potential region-specific drug repurposing targets for ad.",Hum Mol Genet,2022
35661211,Altered hydroxymethylome in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and aging and genetic and environmental exposure can contribute to its pathogenesis. DNA methylation has been suggested to play a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is generated through 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidization by ten-eleven translocation proteins and is particularly enriched in the brain. Although 5hmC has been linked to multiple neurological disorders, little is known about 5hmC alterations in the substantia nigra of patients with PD. To determine the specific alterations in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in PD brain samples, we examined the genome-wide profiles of 5mC and 5hmC in the substantia nigra of patients with PD and Alzheimer's disease (ad). We identified 4119 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) and no differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the postmortem brains of patients with PD compared with those of controls. These DhMRs were PD-specific when compared with the results of AD. Gene ontology analysis revealed that several signaling pathways, such as neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, were significantly enriched in PD DhMRs. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed substantial alterations in multiple signaling pathways, including phospholipase D (PLD), cAMP and Rap1. In addition, using a PD Drosophila model, we found that one of the 5hmC-modulated genes, PLD1, modulated α-synuclein toxicity. Our analysis suggested that 5hmC may act as an independent epigenetic marker and contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.",Hum Mol Genet,2022
36018824,Quantitative trait locus (xQTL) approaches identify risk genes and drug targets from human non-coding genomes.,"Advances and reduction of costs in various sequencing technologies allow for a closer look at variations present in the non-coding regions of the human genome. Correlating non-coding variants with large-scale multi-omic data holds the promise not only of a better understanding of likely causal connections between non-coding DNA and expression of traits but also identifying potential disease-modifying medicines. Genome-phenome association studies have created large datasets of DNA variants that are associated with multiple traits or diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease; yet, the functional consequences of variants, in particular of non-coding variants, remain largely unknown. Recent advances in functional genomics and computational approaches have led to the identification of potential roles of DNA variants, such as various quantitative trait locus (xQTL) techniques. Multi-omic assays and analytic approaches toward xQTL have identified links between genetic loci and human transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic data. In this review, we first discuss the recent development of xQTL from multi-omic findings. We then highlight multimodal analysis of xQTL and genetic data for identification of risk genes and drug targets using Alzheimer's disease as an example. We finally discuss challenges and future research directions (e.g. artificial intelligence) for annotation of non-coding variants in complex diseases.",Hum Mol Genet,2022
34897434,Dysregulated mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNA m1A methylation in Alzheimer's disease.,"RNA modifications affect many aspects of RNA metabolism and are involved in the regulation of many different biological processes. Mono-methylation of adenosine in the N1 position, N1-methyladensoine (m1A), is a reversible modification that is known to target rRNAs and tRNAs. m1A has been shown to increase tRNA structural stability and induce correct tRNA folding. Recent studies have begun to associate the dysregulation of epitranscriptomic control with age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Here, we applied the newly developed m1A-quant-seq approach to map the brain abundant m1A RNA modification in the cortex of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, 5XFAD. We observed hypomethylation in both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs in 5XFAD mice compared with wild type. Furthermore, the main enzymes responsible for the addition of m1A in mitochondrial (TRMT10C, HSD17B10) and cytosolic tRNAs (TRMT61A) displayed decreased expression in 5XFAD compared with wild-type mice. Knockdown of these enzymes results in a more severe phenotype in a Drosophila tau model, and differential m1A methylation is correlated with differences in mature mitochondrial tRNA expression. Collectively, this work suggests that hypo m1A modification in tRNAs may play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",Hum Mol Genet,2022
35994042,Non-coding RNAs in Alzheimer's disease: perspectives from omics studies.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the brain and the spinal cord. The pathophysiology of AD is multifactorial with heterogeneous molecular manifestations. The lack of efficacious therapies for AD reinforces the importance of exploring in depth multifaceted disease mechanisms. Recent progresses on AD have generated a large amount of RNA-sequencing data at both bulk and single cell levels and revealed thousands of genes with expression changes in AD. However, the upstream regulators of such gene expression changes are largely unknown. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) represent the majority of the human transcriptome, and regulatory ncRNAs have been found to play an important role in regulating gene expression. A single miRNA usually targets a number of mRNAs and thus such ncRNAs are particular important for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapeutics. This review aims to summarize the recent findings on the roles of ncRNAs in AD from ncRNA-omics studies with a focus on ncRNA signatures, interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs, and ncRNA-regulated pathways in AD. We also review the potential of specific ncRNAs to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. In the end, we point out future directions for studying ncRNAs in AD.",Hum Mol Genet,2022
34428151,A Computational Monte Carlo Simulation Strategy to Determine the Temporal Ordering of Abnormal Age Onset Among Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.,"To quantitatively determining the temporal ordering of abnormal age onsets (AAO) among various biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we introduced a computational Monte-Carlo simulation (CMCS) to statistically examine such ordering of an AAO pair or over all AAOs. The CMCS 1) simulates longitudinal data, estimates AAO for each iteration, and finally assesses the type-I error of an AAO pair or all AAO ordering. Using hippocampus volume (V<sub>HC</sub>), cerebral glucose hypometabolic convergence index (HCI), plasma neurofilament light (NfL), mini-mental state exam (MMSE), the auditory verbal learning test-long term memory (AVLT-LTM), short term memory (AVLT-STM) and clinical-dementia rating sum of box scale (CDR-SOB) from 382 mild cognitive impairment converters and non-converters, the CMCS estimated type-I error for the earlier AAO of V<sub>HC</sub>, AVLT_STM and AVLT_LTM each than MMSE was significant (p&lt;0.002). The type-I error for the overall AAO temporal ordering of V<sub>HC</sub> ≤ AVLT_STM ≤ AVLT_LTM &lt; HCI ≤ MMSE ≤ CDR-SOB ≤ NfL was p = 0.012. These findings showed that our CMCS is capable of providing statistical inferences for quantifying AAO ordering which has important implications in advancing our understanding of AD.",IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,2022
36245380,Altered Odor-Evoked Electrophysiological Responses in the Anterior Piriform Cortex of Conscious APP/PS1 Mice.,"BACKGROUND: Olfactory decline is an indicator of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the anterior piriform cortex (aPC) is an important brain area involved in processing olfactory input, little is known about how its neuronal activity is affected in early-stage AD.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether odor-induced electrophysiological responses are altered in the aPC of 3-5-month-old APP/PS1 mice.
METHODS: Using head-fixed multi-channel recording techniques in APP/PS1 AD mouse model to uncover potential aberrance of the aPC neuronal firing and local field potential (LFP) in response to vanillin.
RESULTS: We show that the firing rate of aPC neurons evoked by vanillin is significantly reduced in conscious APP/PS1 mice. LFP analysis demonstrates reduced low- and high-gamma (γlow,γhigh) oscillations during both the baseline and odor stimulation periods in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, according to spike-field coherence (SFC) analysis, APP/PS1 mice show decreased coherence between odor-evoked spikes and γlow rhythms, while the coherence with γhigh rhythms and the ΔSFC of the oscillations is unaffected. Furthermore, APP/PS1 mice show reduced phase-locking strength in the baseline period, such that there is no difference between baseline and odor-stimulation conditions. This contrasts markedly with wild type mice, where phase-locking strength decreases on stimulation.
CONCLUSION: The abnormalities in both the neuronal and oscillatory activities of the aPC may serve as electrophysiological indicators of underlying olfactory decline in early AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022

36155518,Somatic Mutations and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global health challenge, with an estimated 55 million people suffering from the non-curable disease across the world. While amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain define AD proteinopathy, it has become evident that diverse coding and non-coding regions of the genome may significantly contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The diversity of factors associated with AD pathogenesis, coupled with age-associated damage, suggests that a series of triggering events may be required to initiate AD. Since somatic mutations accumulate with aging, and aging is a major risk factor for AD, there is a great potential for somatic mutational events to drive disease. Indeed, recent data from the Gozes team/laboratories as well as other leading laboratories correlated the accumulation of somatic brain mutations with the progression of tauopathy. In this review, we lay the current perspectives on the principal genetic factors associated with AD and the potential causes, highlighting the contribution of somatic mutations to the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease. The roles that artificial intelligence and big data can play in accelerating the progress of causal somatic mutation markers/biomarkers identification, and the associated drug discovery/repurposing, have been highlighted for future AD and other neurodegenerations, with the aim to bring hope for the vulnerable aging population.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36278353,Associations of Naturally Occurring Antibodies to Presenilin-1 with Brain Amyloid-β Load and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) promotes the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, which is involved in the process of Aβ production. The profiles of autoantibodies are dysregulated in AD patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relative levels and clinical relevance of naturally occurring antibodies to PS1 (NAbs-PS1) in AD.
METHODS: A total of 55 subjects with AD (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to AD), 28 subjects with cognitive impairment (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment) not due to AD (non-AD CI), and 70 cognitively normal (CN) subjects were recruited. One-site ELISA was utilized to determine the relative levels of NAbs-PS1 in plasma.
RESULTS: AD subjects had lower plasma levels of NAbs-PS1 than CN and non-AD CI subjects. Plasma NAbs-PS1 were negatively associated with the brain Aβ load, as reflected by PET-PiB SUVR, and were positively associated with cognitive functions of participants. Plasma NAbs-PS1 discriminated AD patients from CN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.730, a sensitivity of 69.09%, and a specificity of 67.14%, and they discriminated AD patients from non-AD CI subjects with an AUC of 0.750, a specificity of 70.91%, and a sensitivity of 71.43%.
CONCLUSION: This study found an aberrant immunological phenotype in AD patients. Further investigations are needed to determine the pathophysiological functions of NAbs-PS1 in AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36155517,"An Alzheimer's Disease Mechanism Based on Early Pathology, Anatomy, Vascular-Induced Flow, and Migration of Maximum Flow Stress Energy Location with Increasing Vascular Disease.","This paper suggests a chemical mechanism for the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress ""hot spots"" in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as Aβ and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest Aβ and tau AD disease pathologies. A key to the proposed AD mechanism is a comparison of early chronic traumatic encephalopathy and AD pathologies. Experiments that test the proposed mechanism are needed.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36245378,"Association of Kidney Function with Risk of Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study of 275,167 UK Biobank Participants.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether CKD is a risk factor for dementia and compare the performance of different measures of calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
METHODS: 275,167 participants from UK Biobank were included and eGFR at baseline was calculated using serum creatinine (eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), and creatinine-cystatin C equations (eGFRcr-cys). Restricted cubic splines and Cox regression models were performed to assess the relationship of eGFR with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD).
RESULTS: We observed a U-shaped relationship between each eGFR and risk of all-cause dementia and VaD, with eGFRcys and eGFRcr-cys showing a closer linkage (peGFRcys <0.0001, peGFRcrhboxcys<0.0001 and peGFRcr = 0.0001). Lower and supranormal eGFR were related to increased risk of all-cause dementia. Compared to the reference category of 90-104 ml/min/1.73 m2, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause dementia for eGFRcr-cys 30-59, <30, and ≥105 ml/min/1.73 m2 were 1.26 (95% CI [1.05-1.50], p = 0.012), 2.62 (95% CI [1.54-4.47], p < 0.001), and 1.41 (95% CI [1.17-1.70], p < 0.001). No statistically significant association was observed between eGFR with risk of AD.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study identified impaired kidney function as a critical risk factor for dementia and noted the application of cystatin C strengthened the relationship between CKD and dementia, underlining the significant value of preserving kidney function to reduce the risk of dementia and considering cystatin C measurement as part of clinical practice.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022

36314209,Hypothalamic Functional Connectivity and Apathy in People with Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitively Normal Healthy Controls.,"BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have described the neural markers of apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but few focused on the motivation circuits. Here, we targeted hypothalamus, a hub of the motivation circuit.
OBJECTIVE: To examine hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in relation to apathy.
METHODS: We performed whole-brain regression of hypothalamic rsFC against Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) total score and behavioral, cognitive, and emotional subscores in 29 patients with AD/MCI and 28 healthy controls (HC), controlling for age, sex, education, cognitive status, and depression. We evaluated the results at a corrected threshold and employed path analyses to assess possible interaction between hypothalamic rsFCs, apathy and depression/memory. Finally, we re-examined the findings in a subsample of amyloid-β-verified AD.
RESULTS: AES total score correlated negatively with hypothalamic precuneus (PCu)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and positively with left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and supramarginal gyrus rsFCs. Behavioral subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic PCu/PCC and positively with middle frontal gyrus rsFC. Cognitive subscore correlated positively with hypothalamic MTG rsFC. Emotional subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic calcarine cortex rsFC. In path analyses, hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC negatively modulated apathy and, in turn, depression. The model where hypothalamic MTG rsFC and memory independently modulated apathy also showed a good fit. The findings of diminished hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC in relation to apathy and, in turn, depression were confirmed in amyloid-verified AD.
CONCLUSION: The findings together support a role of altered hypothalamic connectivity in relation to apathy and depression, and modulation of apathy by memory dysfunction.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36155515,Characteristics of Drawing Process Differentiate Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies.,"BACKGROUND: Early differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is important for treatment and disease management, but it remains challenging. Although computer-based drawing analysis may help differentiate AD and DLB, it has not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the differences in features characterizing the drawing process between AD, DLB, and cognitively normal (CN) individuals, and to evaluate the validity of using these features to identify and differentiate AD and DLB.
METHODS: We collected drawing data with a digitizing tablet and pen from 123 community-dwelling older adults in three clinical diagnostic groups of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD (n = 47) or Lewy body disease (LBD; n = 27), and CN (n = 49), matched for their age, sex, and years of education. We then investigated drawing features in terms of the drawing speed, pressure, and pauses.
RESULTS: Reduced speed and reduced smoothness in speed and pressure were observed particularly in the LBD group, while increased pauses and total durations were observed in both the AD and LBD groups. Machine-learning models using these features achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80 for AD versus CN, 0.88 for LBD versus CN, and 0.77 for AD versus LBD.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate how different types of drawing features were particularly discriminative between the diagnostic groups, and how the combination of these features can facilitate the identification and differentiation of AD and DLB.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36278349,Synaptic Proteins as Fluid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Synaptic disruption precedes neuronal death and correlates with clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The identification of fluid biomarkers of synaptic damage is emerging as a goal for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether fluid biomarkers of synaptic damage are impaired in AD.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for articles reporting synaptic proteins as fluid biomarkers in AD and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. Pooled effect sizes were determined using the Hedge G method with random effects. Questions adapted from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies were applied for quality assessment. A protocol for this study has been previously registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42021277487).
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 204 articles that were assessed for eligibility. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review and 15 were included in the meta-analysis. For Neurogranin, 827 AD and 1,237 CU subjects were included in the meta-analysis, showing a significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD compared to CU individuals, with an effect size of 1.01 (p < 0.001). A significant increase in SNAP-25 and GAP-43 levels in CSF of patients with AD was observed.
CONCLUSION: Neurogranin, SNAP-25, and GAP-43 are possible biomarkers of synaptic damage in AD, and other potential synaptic biomarkers are emerging. This meta-analysis also revealed that there are still relatively few studies investigating these biomarkers in patients with AD or other dementias and showed wide heterogeneity in literature.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36155523,Quality of Life and the Experience of Living with Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to better understand the experience of patients living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the early stages.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the perception of quality of life in patients with early-stage AD.
METHODS: A multicenter, non-interventional study was conducted including patients of 50-90 years of age with prodromal or mild AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥22, and a Clinical Dementia Rating-Global score (CDR-GS) of 0.5.-1.0. The Quality of Life in Alzheimer 's Disease (QoL-AD) questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of life. A battery of self-report instruments was used to evaluate different psychological and behavioral domains. Associations between the QoL-AD and other outcome measures were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlations.
RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were included. Mean age (SD) was 72.3 (7.0) years and mean disease duration was 1.4 (1.8) years. Mean MMSE score was 24.6 (2.1). The mean QoL-AD score was 37.9 (4.5). Eighty-three percent (n = 124) of patients had moderate-to-severe hopelessness, 22.1% (n = 33) had depressive symptoms, and 36.9% (n = 55) felt stigmatized. The quality of life showed a significant positive correlation with self-efficacy and negative correlations with depression, emotional and practical consequences, stigma, and hopelessness.
CONCLUSION: Stigma, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness are frequent scenarios in AD negatively impacting quality of life, even in a population with short disease duration and minimal cognitive impairment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022

36050860,The 677C &gt; T variant in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase causes morphological and functional cerebrovascular deficits in mice.,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) particularly Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are increasing; however, mechanisms driving cerebrovascular decline are poorly understood. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a critical enzyme in the folate and methionine cycles. Variants in MTHFR, notably 677 C &gt; T, are associated with dementias, but no mouse model existed to identify mechanisms by which MTHFR<sup>677C &gt; T</sup> increases risk. Therefore, MODEL-AD created a novel knock-in (KI) strain carrying the Mthfr<sup>677C &gt; T</sup> allele on the C57BL/6J background (Mthfr<sup>677C &gt; T</sup>) to characterize morphology and function perturbed by the variant. Consistent with human clinical data, Mthfr<sup>677C &gt; T</sup> mice have reduced enzyme activity in the liver and elevated plasma homocysteine levels. MTHFR enzyme activity is also reduced in the Mthfr<sup>677C &gt; T</sup> brain. Mice showed reduced tissue perfusion in numerous brain regions by PET/CT as well as significantly reduced vascular density, pericyte number and increased GFAP-expressing astrocytes in frontal cortex. Electron microscopy revealed cerebrovascular damage including endothelial and pericyte apoptosis, reduced luminal size, and increased astrocyte and microglial presence in the microenvironment. Collectively, these data support a mechanism by which variations in MTHFR perturb cerebrovascular health laying the foundation to incorporate our new Mthfr<sup>677C &gt; T</sup> mouse model in studies examining genetic susceptibility for cerebrovascular dysfunction in ADRDs.",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,2022
35863150,Neuropsychiatric symptoms influence differently cognitive decline in older women and men.,"OBJECTIVE: The potential impact of sex on cognitive performance in normal aging and participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been outlined previously. Nevertheless, differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) have been also outlined. We aimed to study a potential association between NPS and cognitive performances according to sex, in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Demographic, neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological data from the ADNI and NACC databases were merged into a dataset of 506 participants with healthy cognitive performance, 467 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 238 patients with AD. Cognitive performance in each group was evaluated according to sex and the presence of NPS.
RESULTS: Based on sex, cognitive performance differed according to clinical stage: in the healthy controls and AD groups, women had better fluency performance, while in the mild cognitive impairment group, women had better working memory and men better oral naming. Regardless of sex, depression showed a negative effect on processing speed in AD. Finally, there was an interaction between sex and NPS in mild cognitive impairment, where women with apathy had better working memory performance, and in AD, women with depression had better fluency performance. The opposite pattern being was observed in men, where men with depression have worse focused attention.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance is influenced by sex, yet this influence has different manifestations at normal cognition, MCI or AD. Furthermore, apathy and depression seem to influence differently women and men at different types of cognitive decline.",J Psychiatr Res,2022
36577843,Hydroxychloroquine lowers Alzheimer's disease and related dementias risk and rescues molecular phenotypes related to Alzheimer's disease.,"We recently nominated cytokine signaling through the Janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway as a potential AD drug target. As hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has recently been shown to inactivate STAT3, we hypothesized that it may impact AD pathogenesis and risk. Among 109,124 rheumatoid arthritis patients from routine clinical care, HCQ initiation was associated with a lower risk of incident AD compared to methotrexate initiation across 4 alternative analyses schemes addressing specific types of biases including informative censoring, reverse causality, and outcome misclassification (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] of 0.92 [0.83-1.00], 0.87 [0.81-0.93], 0.84 [0.76-0.93], and 0.87 [0.75-1.01]). We additionally show that HCQ exerts dose-dependent effects on late long-term potentiation (LTP) and rescues impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity prior to significant accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, HCQ treatment enhances microglial clearance of Aβ<sub>1-42,</sub> lowers neuroinflammation, and reduces tau phosphorylation in cell culture-based phenotypic assays. Finally, we show that HCQ inactivates STAT3 in microglia, neurons, and astrocytes suggesting a plausible mechanism associated with its observed effects on AD pathogenesis. HCQ, a relatively safe and inexpensive drug in current use may be a promising disease-modifying AD treatment. This hypothesis merits testing through adequately powered clinical trials in at-risk individuals during preclinical stages of disease progression.",Mol Psychiatry,2022
36504237,Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Synaptic Dysfunction are Altered in Parkinson's Disease and Related Disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction and degeneration are central contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, identification and validation of biomarkers reflecting pathological synaptic alterations are greatly needed and could be used in prognostic assessment and to monitor treatment effects.
OBJECTIVE: To explore candidate biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders.
METHODS: Mass spectrometry was used to quantify 15 synaptic proteins in two clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cohorts, including PD (n<sub>1</sub>  = 51, n<sub>2</sub>  = 101), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (n<sub>1</sub>  = 11, n<sub>2</sub>  = 3), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n<sub>1</sub>  = 22, n<sub>2</sub>  = 21), multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n<sub>1</sub>  = 31, n<sub>2</sub>  = 26), and healthy control (HC) (n<sub>1</sub>  = 48, n<sub>2</sub>  = 30) participants, as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n<sub>2</sub>  = 23) patients in the second cohort.
RESULTS: Across both cohorts, lower levels of the neuronal pentraxins (NPTX; 1, 2, and receptor) were found in PD, MSA, and PSP, compared with HC. In MSA and PSP, lower neurogranin, AP2B1, and complexin-2 levels compared with HC were observed. In AD, levels of 14-3-3 zeta/delta, beta- and gamma-synuclein were higher compared with the parkinsonian disorders. Lower pentraxin levels in PD correlated with Mini-Mental State Exam scores and specific cognitive deficits (NPTX2; rho = 0.25-0.32, P < 0.05) and reduced dopaminergic pre-synaptic integrity as measured by DaTSCAN (NPTX2; rho = 0.29, P = 0.023). Additionally, lower levels were associated with the progression of postural imbalance and gait difficulty symptoms (All NPTX; β-estimate = -0.025 to -0.038, P < 0.05) and cognitive decline (NPTX2; β-estimate = 0.32, P = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings show different alterations of synaptic proteins in parkinsonian disorders compared with AD and HC. The neuronal pentraxins may serve as prognostic CSF biomarkers for both cognitive and motor symptom progression in PD. © 2022 The Authors.

34764492,Identifying phenotype-associated subpopulations by integrating bulk and single-cell sequencing data.,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) distinguishes cell types, states and lineages within the context of heterogeneous tissues. However, current single-cell data cannot directly link cell clusters with specific phenotypes. Here we present Scissor, a method that identifies cell subpopulations from single-cell data that are associated with a given phenotype. Scissor integrates phenotype-associated bulk expression data and single-cell data by first quantifying the similarity between each single cell and each bulk sample. It then optimizes a regression model on the correlation matrix with the sample phenotype to identify relevant subpopulations. Applied to a lung cancer scRNA-seq dataset, Scissor identified subsets of cells associated with worse survival and with TP53 mutations. In melanoma, Scissor discerned a T cell subpopulation with low PDCD1/CTLA4 and high TCF7 expression associated with an immunotherapy response. Beyond cancer, Scissor was effective in interpreting facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer's disease datasets. Scissor identifies biologically and clinically relevant cell subpopulations from single-cell assays by leveraging phenotype and bulk-omics datasets.",Nat Biotechnol,2022
36418293,Enhanced activity of Alzheimer disease-associated variant of protein kinase Cα drives cognitive decline in a mouse model.,"Exquisitely tuned activity of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes is essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Whereas loss-of-function mutations are generally associated with cancer, gain-of-function variants in one isozyme, PKCα, are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that the enhanced activity of one variant, PKCα M489V, is sufficient to rewire the brain phosphoproteome, drive synaptic degeneration, and impair cognition in a mouse model. This variant causes a modest 30% increase in catalytic activity without altering on/off activation dynamics or stability, underscoring that enhanced catalytic activity is sufficient to drive the biochemical, cellular, and ultimately cognitive effects observed. Analysis of hippocampal neurons from PKCα M489V mice reveals enhanced amyloid-β-induced synaptic depression and reduced spine density compared to wild-type mice. Behavioral studies reveal that this mutation alone is sufficient to impair cognition, and, when coupled to a mouse model of AD, further accelerates cognitive decline. The druggability of protein kinases positions PKCα as a promising therapeutic target in AD.",Nat Commun,2022
36517479,Optimal deep brain stimulation sites and networks for stimulation of the fornix in Alzheimer's disease.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the fornix is an investigational treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease. Outcomes from randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive function improved in some patients but deteriorated in others. This could be explained by variance in electrode placement leading to differential engagement of neural circuits. To investigate this, we performed a post-hoc analysis on a multi-center cohort of 46 patients with DBS to the fornix (NCT00658125, NCT01608061). Using normative structural and functional connectivity data, we found that stimulation of the circuit of Papez and stria terminalis robustly associated with cognitive improvement (R = 0.53, p < 0.001). On a local level, the optimal stimulation site resided at the direct interface between these structures (R = 0.48, p < 0.001). Finally, modulating specific distributed brain networks related to memory accounted for optimal outcomes (R = 0.48, p < 0.001). Findings were robust to multiple cross-validation designs and may define an optimal network target that could refine DBS surgery and programming.",Nat Commun,2022
36443293,Experimental evidence for temporal uncoupling of brain Aβ deposition and neurodegenerative sequelae.,"Brain Aβ deposition is a key early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer´s disease (AD), but the long presymptomatic phase and poor correlation between Aβ deposition and clinical symptoms remain puzzling. To elucidate the dependency of downstream pathologies on Aβ, we analyzed the trajectories of cerebral Aβ accumulation, Aβ seeding activity, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in the CSF (a biomarker of neurodegeneration) in Aβ-precursor protein transgenic mice. We find that Aβ deposition increases linearly until it reaches an apparent plateau at a late age, while Aβ seeding activity increases more rapidly and reaches a plateau earlier, coinciding with the onset of a robust increase of CSF NfL. Short-term inhibition of Aβ generation in amyloid-laden mice reduced Aβ deposition and associated glial changes, but failed to reduce Aβ seeding activity, and CSF NfL continued to increase although at a slower pace. When short-term or long-term inhibition of Aβ generation was started at pre-amyloid stages, CSF NfL did not increase despite some Aβ deposition, microglial activation, and robust brain Aβ seeding activity. A dissociation of Aβ load and CSF NfL trajectories was also found in familial AD, consistent with the view that Aβ aggregation is not kinetically coupled to neurotoxicity. Rather, neurodegeneration starts when Aβ seeding activity is saturated and before Aβ deposition reaches critical (half-maximal) levels, a phenomenon reminiscent of the two pathogenic phases in prion disease.",Nat Commun,2022
36333294,Amyloid-associated increases in soluble tau relate to tau aggregation rates and cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease.,"For optimal design of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) and anti-tau clinical trials, we need to better understand the pathophysiological cascade of Aβ- and tau-related processes. Therefore, we set out to investigate how Aβ and soluble phosphorylated tau (p-tau) relate to the accumulation of tau aggregates assessed with PET and subsequent cognitive decline across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Using human cross-sectional and longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive assessment data, we show that in early stages of AD, increased concentration of soluble CSF p-tau is strongly associated with accumulation of insoluble tau aggregates across the brain, and CSF p-tau levels mediate the effect of Aβ on tau aggregation. Further, higher soluble p-tau concentrations are mainly related to faster accumulation of tau aggregates in the regions with strong functional connectivity to individual tau epicenters. In this early stage, higher soluble p-tau concentrations is associated with cognitive decline, which is mediated by faster increase of tau aggregates. In contrast, in AD dementia, when Aβ fibrils and soluble p-tau levels have plateaued, cognitive decline is related to the accumulation rate of insoluble tau aggregates. Our data suggest that therapeutic approaches reducing soluble p-tau levels might be most favorable in early AD, before widespread insoluble tau aggregates.",Nat Commun,2022

35760863,A shared disease-associated oligodendrocyte signature among multiple CNS pathologies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, perturbing neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations. In this study, using single-cell transcriptomics, we mapped all non-immune, non-neuronal cell populations in wild-type and AD model (5xFAD) mouse brains. We identified an oligodendrocyte state that increased in association with brain pathology, which we termed disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DOLs). In a murine model of amyloidosis, DOLs appear long after plaque accumulation, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) alone was not sufficient to induce the DOL signature in vitro. DOLs could be identified in a mouse model of tauopathy and in other murine neurodegenerative and autoimmune inflammatory conditions, suggesting a common response to severe pathological conditions. Using quantitative spatial analysis of mouse and postmortem human brain tissues, we found that oligodendrocytes expressing a key DOL marker (SERPINA3N/SERPINA3 accordingly) are present in the cortex in areas of brain damage and are enriched near Aβ plaques. In postmortem human brain tissue, the expression level of this marker correlated with cognitive decline. Altogether, this study uncovers a shared signature of oligodendrocytes in central nervous system pathologies.",Nat Neurosci,2022
35654956,"Faulty autolysosome acidification in Alzheimer's disease mouse models induces autophagic build-up of Aβ in neurons, yielding senile plaques.","Autophagy is markedly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we reveal unique autophagy dysregulation within neurons in five AD mouse models in vivo and identify its basis using a neuron-specific transgenic mRFP-eGFP-LC3 probe of autophagy and pH, multiplex confocal imaging and correlative light electron microscopy. Autolysosome acidification declines in neurons well before extracellular amyloid deposition, associated with markedly lowered vATPase activity and build-up of Aβ/APP-βCTF selectively within enlarged de-acidified autolysosomes. In more compromised yet still intact neurons, profuse Aβ-positive autophagic vacuoles (AVs) pack into large membrane blebs forming flower-like perikaryal rosettes. This unique pattern, termed PANTHOS (poisonous anthos (flower)), is also present in AD brains. Additional AVs coalesce into peri-nuclear networks of membrane tubules where fibrillar β-amyloid accumulates intraluminally. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization, cathepsin release and lysosomal cell death ensue, accompanied by microglial invasion. Quantitative analyses confirm that individual neurons exhibiting PANTHOS are the principal source of senile plaques in amyloid precursor protein AD models.",Nat Neurosci,2022
35115731,Large-scale deep multi-layer analysis of Alzheimer's disease brain reveals strong proteomic disease-related changes not observed at the RNA level.,"The biological processes that are disrupted in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain remain incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed the proteomes of more than 1,000 brain tissues to reveal new AD-related protein co-expression modules that were highly preserved across cohorts and brain regions. Nearly half of the protein co-expression modules, including modules significantly altered in AD, were not observed in RNA networks from the same cohorts and brain regions, highlighting the proteopathic nature of AD. Two such AD-associated modules unique to the proteomic network included a module related to MAPK signaling and metabolism and a module related to the matrisome. The matrisome module was influenced by the APOE ε4 allele but was not related to the rate of cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathology. By contrast, the MAPK/metabolism module was strongly associated with the rate of cognitive decline. Disease-associated modules unique to the proteome are sources of promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD.",Nat Neurosci,2022
36344699,Bassoon contributes to tau-seed propagation and neurotoxicity.,"Tau aggregation is a defining histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in tau propagation remain unclear. Here, we performed an unbiased quantitative proteomic study to identify proteins that specifically interact with this tau seed. We identified Bassoon (BSN), a presynaptic scaffolding protein, as an interactor of the tau seed isolated from a mouse model of tauopathy, and from Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy postmortem samples. We show that BSN exacerbates tau seeding and toxicity in both mouse and Drosophila models for tauopathy, and that BSN downregulation decreases tau spreading and overall disease pathology, rescuing synaptic and behavioral impairments and reducing brain atrophy. Our findings improve the understanding of how tau seeds can be stabilized by interactors such as BSN.

Here, we investigated brain amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation throughout the aging process in an amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-in (KI) mouse model of AD that expresses human APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> with or without human apoE4 or apoE3. Brain Aβ42 levels were significantly lower in 9-month-old mice that express human isoforms of apoE than in age-matched APP-KI control mice. Linear accumulation of Aβ42 began in 5-month-old apoE4 mice, and a strong increase in Aβ42 levels was observed in 21-month-old apoE3 mice. Aβ42 levels in cerebroventricular fluid were higher in apoE3 than in apoE4 mice at 6-7 months of age, suggesting that apoE3 is more efficient at clearing Aβ42 than apoE4 at these ages. However, apoE3 protein levels were lower than apoE4 protein levels in the brains of 21-month-old apoE3 and apoE4 mice, respectively, which may explain the rapid increase in brain Aβ42 burden in apoE3 mice. We identified genes that were downregulated in a human apoE-dependent (apoE4 &gt; apoE3) and age-dependent (apoE3 = apoE4) manner, which may regulate brain Aβ burden and/or AD progression. Analysis of gene expression in AD mouse models helps identify molecular mechanisms of pleiotropy by the human APOE gene during aging.",Neurobiol Aging,2022
36739619,Neural atrophy produced by AAV tau injections into hippocampus and anterior cortex of middle-aged mice.,"Animal models of tauopathy help in understanding the role of mutations in tau pathobiology. Here, we used adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to administer three tau genetic variants (tau<sup>wild-type</sup>, tau<sup>P301L</sup>, and tau<sup>R406W</sup>) intracranially into 12-month-old C57BL/6Nia mice and collected tissue at 16 months. Vectors designed to express green fluorescent protein controlled for surgical procedures and exogenous protein expression by AAV. The tau genetic variants produced considerably different phenotypes. Tau<sup>wild-type</sup> and tau<sup>P301L</sup> caused memory impairments. The tau<sup>P301L</sup> caused increased amounts of aggregated tau, measured both neurochemically and histologically. Tau<sup>wild-type</sup> produced elevated levels of soluble tau and phosphorylated tau by ELISA and increased staining for phosphorylated forms of tau histologically. However, only the tau<sup>wild-type</sup> caused localized atrophy of brain tissue at the sites near the injection. The tau<sup>R406W</sup> had low protein expression and produced no atrophy or memory impairments. This supports the potential use of AAV expressing tau<sup>wild-type</sup> in aged mice to examine events leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease pathology.",Neurobiol Aging,2022
36599749,Single-neuron whole genome sequencing identifies increased somatic mutation burden in Alzheimer's disease related genes.,"Accumulation of somatic mutations in human neurons is associated with aging and neurodegeneration. To shed light on the somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurons and get more insight into the role of somatic mutations in AD pathogenesis, we performed single-neuron whole genome sequencing to detect genome-wide somatic mutations (single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and Indels) in 96 single prefrontal cortex neurons from 8 AD patients and 8 elderly controls. We found that the mutational burden is ∼3000 somatic mutations per neuron genome in elderly subjects. AD patients have increased somatic mutation burden in AD-related annotation categories, including AD risk genes and differentially expressed genes in AD neurons. Mutational signature analysis showed somatic SNVs (sSNVs) primarily caused by aging and oxidative DNA damage processes but no significant difference was detected between AD and controls. Additionally, functional somatic mutations identified in AD patients showed significant enrichment in several AD-related pathways, including AD pathway, Notch-signaling pathway and Calcium-signaling pathway. These findings provide genetic insights into how somatic mutations may alter the function of single neurons and exert their potential roles in the pathogenesis of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2022
36535550,"Ethanol exposure alters Alzheimer's-related pathology, behavior, and metabolism in APP/PS1 mice.","Epidemiological studies identified alcohol use disorder (AUD) as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet there is conflicting evidence on how alcohol use promotes AD pathology. In this study, a 10-week moderate two-bottle choice drinking paradigm was used to identify how chronic ethanol exposure alters amyloid-β (Aβ)-related pathology, metabolism, and behavior. Ethanol-exposed APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice showed increased brain atrophy and an increased number of amyloid plaques. Further analysis revealed that ethanol exposure led to a shift in the distribution of plaque size in the cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol-exposed mice developed a greater number of smaller plaques, potentially setting the stage for increased plaque proliferation in later life. Ethanol drinking APP/PS1 mice also exhibited deficits in nest building, a metric of self-care, as well as increased locomotor activity and central zone exploration in an open field test. Ethanol exposure also led to a diurnal shift in feeding behavior which was associated with changes in glucose homeostasis and glucose intolerance. Complementary in vivo microdialysis experiments were used to measure how acute ethanol directly modulates Aβ in the hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF). Acute ethanol transiently increased hippocampal ISF glucose levels, suggesting that ethanol directly affects cerebral metabolism. Acute ethanol also selectively increased ISF Aβ40, but not ISF Aβ42, levels during withdrawal. Lastly, chronic ethanol drinking increased N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and decreased γ-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) mRNA levels, indicating a potential hyperexcitable shift in the brain's excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Collectively, these experiments suggest that ethanol may increase Aβ deposition by disrupting metabolism and the brain's E/I balance. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that a moderate drinking paradigm culminates in an interaction between alcohol use and AD-related phenotypes with a potentiation of AD-related pathology, behavioral dysfunction, and metabolic impairment.",Neurobiol Dis,2022
36240948,Cannabidiol inhibits microglia activation and mitigates neuronal damage induced by kainate in an in-vitro seizure model.,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorder and, despite the possible use of several therapeutic options, many patients continue to have seizures for their entire lifespan and they need new therapeutic approaches. In the last years the interest on the non-psychoactive compounds present in Cannabis sativa has massively increased, and cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of different types of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy, ischemia, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of the selected cannabinoids, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD and cannabigerol (CBG) in rat organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to kainate, an in vitro seizure model. Cell death in the cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3) hippocampal subregion was quantified by propidium iodide fluorescence. Morphological analysis and tissue organization were examined by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy and microglia activation and polarization was evaluated using flow cytometry and morphology analysis.
RESULTS: When present in the incubation medium, cannabidiol reduced dose-dependent CA3 injury induced by kainate. Conversely, incubation with THC exacerbated hippocampal damage. The neuroprotective effects of cannabidiol were blocked by TRPV1, TRPV2, 5-HT1A, and PPARγ antagonists. Confocal microscopy confirmed that CBD but not THC had a significant protective effect against neuronal damage and tissue disorganization caused by kainate. Cannabidiol incubation significantly block the microglia activation from the M0 to M1 phenotype observed in the kainate in-vitro seizure model, pushing toward a transition from M0 to M2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CBD mitigated neuronal damage induced by kainate and blocked the transition from the M0 to the M1 phenotype.",Neurobiol Dis,2022
36375407,Genuine high-order interactions in brain networks and neurodegeneration.,"Brain functional networks have been traditionally studied considering only interactions between pairs of regions, neglecting the richer information encoded in higher orders of interactions. In consequence, most of the connectivity studies in neurodegeneration and dementia use standard pairwise metrics. Here, we developed a genuine high-order functional connectivity (HOFC) approach that captures interactions between 3 or more regions across spatiotemporal scales, delivering a more biologically plausible characterization of the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration. We applied HOFC to multimodal (electroencephalography [EEG], and functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) data from patients diagnosed with behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy controls. HOFC revealed large effect sizes, which, in comparison to standard pairwise metrics, provided a more accurate and parsimonious characterization of neurodegeneration. The multimodal characterization of neurodegeneration revealed hypo and hyperconnectivity on medium to large-scale brain networks, with a larger contribution of the former. Regions as the amygdala, the insula, and frontal gyrus were associated with both effects, suggesting potential compensatory processes in hub regions. fMRI revealed hypoconnectivity in AD between regions of the default mode, salience, visual, and auditory networks, while in bvFTD between regions of the default mode, salience, and somatomotor networks. EEG revealed hypoconnectivity in the γ band between frontal, limbic, and sensory regions in AD, and in the δ band between frontal, temporal, parietal and posterior areas in bvFTD, suggesting additional pathophysiological processes that fMRI alone can not capture. Classification accuracy was comparable with standard biomarkers and robust against confounders such as sample size, age, education, and motor artifacts (from fMRI and EEG). We conclude that high-order interactions provide a detailed, EEG- and fMRI compatible, biologically plausible, and psychopathological-specific characterization of different neurodegenerative conditions.",Neurobiol Dis,2022
36198319,Multiscale imaging informs translational mouse modeling of neurological disease.,"Multiscale neurophysiology reveals that simple motor actions are associated with changes in neuronal firing in virtually every brain region studied. Accordingly, the assessment of focal pathology such as stroke or progressive neurodegenerative diseases must also extend widely across brain areas. To derive mechanistic information through imaging, multiple resolution scales and multimodal factors must be included, such as the structure and function of specific neurons and glial cells and the dynamics of specific neurotransmitters. Emerging multiscale methods in preclinical animal studies that span micro- to macroscale examinations fill this gap, allowing a circuit-based understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. Combined with high-performance computation and open-source data repositories, these emerging multiscale and large field-of-view techniques include live functional ultrasound, multi- and single-photon wide-scale light microscopy, video-based miniscopes, and tissue-penetrating fiber photometry, as well as variants of post-mortem expansion microscopy. We present these technologies and outline use cases and data pipelines to uncover new knowledge within animal models of stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and movement disorders.",Neuron,2022
36048760,Neurocognitive trajectory and proteomic signature of inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"For Alzheimer's disease-a leading cause of dementia and global morbidity-improved identification of presymptomatic high-risk individuals and identification of new circulating biomarkers are key public health needs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a polygenic predictor of risk for Alzheimer's disease would identify a subset of the population with increased risk of clinically diagnosed dementia, subclinical neurocognitive dysfunction, and a differing circulating proteomic profile. Using summary association statistics from a recent genome-wide association study, we first developed a polygenic predictor of Alzheimer's disease comprised of 7.1 million common DNA variants. We noted a 7.3-fold (95% CI 4.8 to 11.0; p < 0.001) gradient in risk across deciles of the score among 288,289 middle-aged participants of the UK Biobank study. In cross-sectional analyses stratified by age, minimal differences in risk of Alzheimer's disease and performance on a digit recall test were present according to polygenic score decile at age 50 years, but significant gradients emerged by age 65. Similarly, among 30,541 participants of the Mass General Brigham Biobank, we again noted no significant differences in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis at younger ages across deciles of the score, but for those over 65 years we noted an odds ratio of 2.0 (95% CI 1.3 to 3.2; p = 0.002) in the top versus bottom decile of the polygenic score. To understand the proteomic signature of inherited risk, we performed aptamer-based profiling in 636 blood donors (mean age 43 years) with very high or low polygenic scores. In addition to the well-known apolipoprotein E biomarker, this analysis identified 27 additional proteins, several of which have known roles related to disease pathogenesis. Differences in protein concentrations were consistent even among the youngest subset of blood donors (mean age 33 years). Of these 28 proteins, 7 of the 8 proteins with concentrations available were similarly associated with the polygenic score in participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. These data highlight the potential for a DNA-based score to identify high-risk individuals during the prolonged presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease and to enable biomarker discovery based on profiling of young individuals in the extremes of the score distribution.",PLoS Genet,2022
36342969,Mosaic patterns of selection in genomic regions associated with diverse human traits.,"Natural selection shapes the genetic architecture of many human traits. However, the prevalence of different modes of selection on genomic regions associated with variation in traits remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed an efficient computational framework to calculate positive and negative enrichment of different evolutionary measures among regions associated with complex traits. We applied the framework to summary statistics from >900 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and 11 evolutionary measures of sequence constraint, population differentiation, and allele age while accounting for linkage disequilibrium, allele frequency, and other potential confounders. We demonstrate that this framework yields consistent results across GWASs with variable sample sizes, numbers of trait-associated SNPs, and analytical approaches. The resulting evolutionary atlas maps diverse signatures of selection on genomic regions associated with complex human traits on an unprecedented scale. We detected positive enrichment for sequence conservation among trait-associated regions for the majority of traits (>77% of 290 high power GWASs), which included reproductive traits. Many traits also exhibited substantial positive enrichment for population differentiation, especially among hair, skin, and pigmentation traits. In contrast, we detected widespread negative enrichment for signatures of balancing selection (51% of GWASs) and absence of enrichment for evolutionary signals in regions associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These results support a pervasive role for negative selection on regions of the human genome that contribute to variation in complex traits, but also demonstrate that diverse modes of evolution are likely to have shaped trait-associated loci. This atlas of evolutionary signatures across the diversity of available GWASs will enable exploration of the relationship between the genetic architecture and evolutionary processes in the human genome.",PLoS Genet,2022

We conducted <sup>31</sup>Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) to assess the impact of sex and menopause on brain high-energy phosphates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi)] and membrane phospholipids [phosphomonoesters/phosphodiesters (PME/PDE)] in 216 midlife cognitively normal individuals at risk for AD, 80% female. Ninety-seven participants completed amyloid-beta (Aβ) <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET. Women exhibited higher ATP utilization than men in AD-vulnerable frontal, posterior cingulate, fusiform, medial and lateral temporal regions (p &lt; 0.001). This profile was evident in frontal cortex at the pre-menopausal and peri-menopausal stage and extended to the other regions at the post-menopausal stage (p = 0.001). Results were significant after multi-variable adjustment for age, APOE-4 status, midlife health indicators, history of hysterectomy/oophorectomy, use of menopause hormonal therapy, and total intracranial volume. While associations between ATP/PCr and Aβ load were not significant, individuals with the highest Aβ load were post-menopausal and peri-menopausal women with ATP/PCr ratios in the higher end of the distribution. No differences in Pi/PCr, Pi/ATP or PME/PDE were detected. Outcomes are consistent with dynamic bioenergetic brain adaptations that are associated with female sex and endocrine aging.",Sci Rep,2022
36371460,Neurotoxicity of diesel exhaust extracts in zebrafish and its implications for neurodegenerative disease.,"Long-term air pollution (AP) exposure, including diesel exhaust exposure, is increasingly being recognized as a major contributor to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. How AP increases the risk of neurodegeneration is not well understood but might include direct neurotoxicity and CNS inflammation. We investigated the impact of diesel exhaust particulate extract (DEPe) exposure on the brain and the mechanisms by which microglia and astroglia might mediate neuronal changes. Zebrafish (ZF) were utilized to determine neuronal toxicity of and microglial response to DEPe and single cell RNA sequencing was employed to study cell type-specific transcriptomic responses within the ZF brain. DEPe exposure induced neuronal injury and microglial activation in vivo. However, preventing the development of microglia did not attenuate DEPe-induced neuron loss, leading us to investigate microglial, astroglial, and neuronal response to DEPe exposure at single-cell resolution. Differentially expressed genes and disease-relevant pathways were identified within glial and neuronal clusters after DEPe exposure. Microglia and astroglia existed in multiple states, some of which appear toxic and others protective to neurons. Neuronal transcriptomic analysis revealed that DEPe exposure reduced expression of autophagy-related genes consistent with direct neurotoxicity. In summary, DEPe exposure was neurotoxic in developing ZF larvae and induced neuroinflammation. The microglial inflammatory response did not contribute to neurotoxicity of DEPe and in fact, some glial clusters upregulated transcriptional pathways that are likely protective. Furthermore, DEPe exposure led to reduced expression of autophagy-related genes in neurons that likely contribute to its toxicity.",Sci Rep,2022
36369435,Differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in PC12 cells under lysophosphatidylcholine stimulation.,"Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was previously found to show neuroprotective effect on nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced signalings. Also, numerous studies reported the emerging roles of long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) involved in neurodegenerative disease. However, the biological mechanism of LPC and expression profile of lncRNAs has not been reported. Here, lncRNAs in PC12 cells under LPC and NGF treatment were analyzed using high throughput sequencing technology for the first time. We identified 564 annotated and 1077 novel lncRNAs in PC12 cells. Among them, 121 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the PC12 cells under LPC stimulation. KEGG analysis showed that differentially expressed mRNAs co-expressed with lncRNAs mainly enriched in ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease etc. LncRNA-mRNA network analysis showed that lncRNA ENSRNOT00000082515 had interactions with 626 different mRNAs suggesting that lncRNA ENSRNOT00000082515 probably play vital role. Finally, sequencing data were validated by qRT-PCR for ENSRNOT00000084874, ENSRNOT00000082515, LNC_001033 forward Fgf18, Vcam1, and Pck2.",Sci Rep,2022
36481877,A tensor decomposition-based integrated analysis applicable to multiple gene expression profiles without sample matching.,"The integrated analysis of multiple gene expression profiles previously measured in distinct studies is problematic since missing both sample matches and common labels prevent their integration in fully data-driven, unsupervised training. In this study, we propose a strategy to enable the integration of multiple gene expression profiles among multiple independent studies with neither labeling nor sample matching using tensor decomposition unsupervised feature extraction. We apply this strategy to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related gene expression profiles that lack precise correspondence among samples, including AD single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) data. We were able to select biologically reasonable genes using the integrated analysis. Overall, integrated gene expression profiles can function analogously to prior- and/or transfer-learning strategies in other machine-learning applications. For scRNA-seq, the proposed approach significantly reduces the required computational memory.",Sci Rep,2022
36424437,Interpretable brain disease classification and relevance-guided deep learning.,"Deep neural networks are increasingly used for neurological disease classification by MRI, but the networks' decisions are not easily interpretable by humans. Heat mapping by deep Taylor decomposition revealed that (potentially misleading) image features even outside of the brain tissue are crucial for the classifier's decision. We propose a regularization technique to train convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers utilizing relevance-guided heat maps calculated online during training. The method was applied using T1-weighted MR images from 128 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (mean age = 71.9 ± 8.5 years) and 290 control subjects (mean age = 71.3 ± 6.4 years). The developed relevance-guided framework achieves higher classification accuracies than conventional CNNs but more importantly, it relies on less but more relevant and physiological plausible voxels within brain tissue. Additionally, preprocessing effects from skull stripping and registration are mitigated. With the interpretability of the decision mechanisms underlying CNNs, these results challenge the notion that unprocessed T1-weighted brain MR images in standard CNNs yield higher classification accuracy in Alzheimer's disease than solely atrophy.",Sci Rep,2022
37712202,Dysregulated glial genes in Alzheimer's disease are essential for homeostatic plasticity: Evidence from integrative epigenetic and single cell analyses.,"Synaptic homeostatic plasticity is a foundational regulatory mechanism that maintains the stability of synaptic and neural functions within the nervous system. Impairment of homeostatic regulation has been linked to synapse destabilization during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent epigenetic and transcriptomic characterizations of the nervous system have revealed intricate molecular details about the aging brain and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, how abnormal epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations in different cell types in AD affect synaptic homeostatic plasticity remains to be elucidated. Various glial cell types play critical roles in modulating synaptic functions both during the aging process and in the context of AD. Here, we investigated the impact of glial dysregulation of histone acetylation and transcriptome in AD on synaptic homeostatic plasticity, using computational analysis combined with electrophysiological methods in Drosophila. By integrating snRNA-seq and H3K9ac ChIP-seq data from the same AD patient cohort, we pinpointed cell type-specific signature genes that were transcriptionally altered by histone acetylation. We subsequently investigated the role of these glial genes in regulating presynaptic homeostatic potentiation in Drosophila. Remarkably, nine glial-specific genes, which were identified through our computational method as targets of H3K9ac and transcriptional dysregulation, were found to be crucial for the regulation of synaptic homeostatic plasticity in Drosophila. Our genetic evidence connects abnormal glial transcriptomic changes in AD with the impairment of homeostatic plasticity in the nervous system. In summary, our integrative computational and genetic studies highlight specific glial genes as potential key players in the homeostatic imbalance observed in AD.",Aging Cell,2023
38041805,"Multimorbidity, cognitive phenotypes, and Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in older adults: A population-based study.","INTRODUCTION: To examine the burden and clusters of multimorbidity in association with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related plasma biomarkers among older adults.
METHODS: This population-based study included 5432 participants (age ≥60 years); of these, plasma amyloid beta (Aβ), total tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured in a subsample (n = 1412). We used hierarchical clustering to generate five multimorbidity clusters from 23 chronic diseases. We diagnosed dementia and MCI following international criteria. Data were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models.
RESULTS: The number of chronic diseases was associated with dementia (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.33), AD (1.13; 1.01 to 1.26), vascular dementia (VaD) (1.44; 1.25 to 1.64), and non-amnestic MCI (1.25; 1.13 to 1.37). Metabolic cluster was associated with VaD and non-amnestic MCI, whereas degenerative ocular cluster was associated with AD (p < 0.05). The number of chronic diseases was associated with increased plasma Aβ and NfL (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Multimorbidity burden and clusters are differentially associated with subtypes of dementia and MCI and AD-related plasma biomarkers in older adults.

37990803,Empirically derived psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes in Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino older adults enrolled in HABS-HD: Associations with AD biomarkers and cognitive outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: Identification of psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes to understand within-group heterogeneity in risk and resiliency to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino older adults is essential for the implementation of precision health approaches.
METHODS: A cluster analysis was performed on baseline measures of socioeconomic resources (annual income, social support, occupational complexity) and psychiatric distress (chronic stress, depression, anxiety) for 1220 racially/ethnically minoritized adults enrolled in the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD). Analyses of covariance adjusting for sociodemographic factors examined phenotype differences in cognition and plasma AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified (1) Low Resource/High Distress (n = 256); (2) High Resource/Low Distress (n = 485); and (3) Low Resource/Low Distress (n = 479) phenotypes. The Low Resource/High Distress phenotype displayed poorer cognition and higher plasma neurofilament light chain; differences between the High Resource/Low Distress and Low Resource/Low Distress phenotypes were minimal.

38050662,Tau-neurodegeneration mismatch reveals vulnerability and resilience to comorbidities in Alzheimer's continuum.,"INTRODUCTION: Variability in relationship of tau-based neurofibrillary tangles (T) and neurodegeneration (N) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from non-specific nature of N, modulated by non-AD co-pathologies, age-related changes, and resilience factors.
METHODS: We used regional T-N residual patterns to partition 184 patients within the Alzheimer's continuum into data-driven groups. These were compared with groups from 159 non-AD (amyloid ""negative"") patients partitioned using cortical thickness, and groups in 98 patients with ante mortem MRI and post mortem tissue for measuring N and T, respectively. We applied the initial T-N residual model to classify 71 patients in an independent cohort into predefined groups.
RESULTS: AD groups displayed spatial T-N mismatch patterns resembling neurodegeneration patterns in non-AD groups, similarly associated with non-AD factors and diverging cognitive outcomes. In the autopsy cohort, limbic T-N mismatch correlated with TDP-43 co-pathology.
DISCUSSION: T-N mismatch may provide a personalized approach for determining non-AD factors associated with resilience/vulnerability in AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
37882354,Maximizing utility of neuropsychological measures in sex-specific predictive models of incident Alzheimer's disease in the Framingham Heart Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Sex differences in neuropsychological (NP) test performance might have important implications for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates sex differences in neuropsychological performance among individuals without dementia at baseline.
METHODS: Neuropsychological assessment data, both standard test scores and process coded responses, from Framingham Heart Study participants were analyzed for sex differences using regression model and Cox proportional hazards model. Optimal NP profiles were identified by machine learning methods for men and women.
RESULTS: Sex differences were observed in both summary scores and composite process scores of NP tests in terms of adjusted means and their associations with AD incidence. The optimal NP profiles for men and women have 10 and 8 measures, respectively, and achieve 0.76 mean area under the curve for AD prediction.

METHODS: We performed <sup>18</sup> F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 4-, 6-, and 12-month-old 5XFAD and littermate controls (WT) of both sexes and analyzed region data via brain metabolic covariance analysis.
RESULTS: The 5XFAD model mice showed age-related changes in glucose uptake relative to WT mice. Analysis of community structure of covariance networks was different across age and sex, with a disruption of metabolic coupling in the 5XFAD model.

38055782,Early-life stress and amyloidosis in mice share pathogenic pathways involving synaptic mitochondria and lipid metabolism.,"INTRODUCTION: Early-life stress (ES) increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others have shown that ES aggravates amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and promotes cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: We studied how ES affects the hippocampal synaptic proteome in wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice at early and late pathological stages, and validated hits using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: The hippocampal synaptosomes of both ES-exposed WT and early-stage APP/PS1 mice showed a relative decrease in actin dynamics-related proteins and a relative increase in mitochondrial proteins. ES had minimal effects on older WT mice, while strongly affecting the synaptic proteome of advanced stage APP/PS1 mice, particularly the expression of astrocytic and mitochondrial proteins.
DISCUSSION: Our data show that ES and amyloidosis share pathogenic pathways involving synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid metabolism, which may underlie the observed impact of ES on the trajectory of AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
37975513,A novel ultrasensitive assay for plasma p-tau217: Performance in individuals with subjective cognitive decline and early Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology among individuals with mild cognitive changes and those experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) remains challenging. Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) is one of the most promising of the emerging biomarkers for AD. However, accessible methods are limited.
METHODS: We employed a novel p-tau217 immunoassay (University of Gothenburg [UGOT] p-tau217) in four independent cohorts (n = 308) including a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-classified cohort (Discovery), two cohorts consisting mostly of cognitively unimpaired (CU) and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) participants (MYHAT and Pittsburgh), and a population-based cohort of individuals with SCD (Barcelonaβeta Brain Research Center's Alzheimer's At-Risk Cohort [β-AARC]).
RESULTS: UGOT p-tau217 showed high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.80-0.91) identifying amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, determined either by Aβ positron emission tomography or CSF Aβ42/40 ratio. In individuals experiencing SCD, UGOT p-tau217 showed high accuracy identifying those with a positive CSF Aβ42/40 ratio (AUC = 0.91).
DISCUSSION: UGOT p-tau217 can be an easily accessible and efficient way to screen and monitor patients with suspected AD pathophysiology, even in the early stages of the continuum.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
37908054,Comparative methods for quantifying plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: Implications for the next frontier in cerebral amyloid angiopathy diagnostics.,"Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau are emerging as accessible biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, many assays exist with variable test performances, highlighting the need for a comparative assessment to identify the most valid assays for future use in AD and to apply to other settings in which the same biomarkers may be useful, namely, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is a progressive cerebrovascular disease characterized by deposition of Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. Novel immunotherapies for AD can induce amyloid-related imaging abnormalities resembling CAA-related inflammation. Few studies have evaluated plasma biomarkers in CAA. Identifying a CAA signature could facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, and a safer selection of patients with AD for emerging immunotherapies. This review evaluates studies that compare the diagnostic test performance of plasma biomarker techniques in AD and cerebrovascular and plasma biomarker profiles of CAA; it also discusses novel hypotheses and future avenues for plasma biomarker research in CAA.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
38085800,Transgenic amyloid precursor protein mouse models of amyloidosis. Incomplete models for Alzheimer's disease but effective predictors of anti-amyloid therapies.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice are models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloidosis, not all of AD. Diffuse, compacted, and vascular deposits in APP mice mimic those found in AD cases.
METHODS: Most interventional studies in APP mice start treatment early in the process of amyloid deposition, consistent with a prevention treatment regimen. Most clinical trials treat patients with established amyloid deposits in a therapeutic treatment regimen.
RESULTS: The first treatment to reduce amyloid and cognitive impairment in mice was immunotherapy. The APP mouse models not only predicted efficacy, but presaged the vascular leakage called ARIA. The recent immunotherapy clinical trials that removed amyloid and slowed cognitive decline confirms the utility of these early APP models when used in therapeutic designs.
DISCUSSION: New mouse models of AD pathologies will add to the research armamentarium, but the early models have accurately predicted responses to amyloid therapies in humans.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
37849026,The type-I interferon response potentiates seeded tau aggregation and exacerbates tau pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Signatures of a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response are observed in the post mortem brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the effect of the IFN-I response on pathological tau accumulation remains unclear.
METHODS: We examined the effects of IFN-I signaling in primary neural culture models of seeded tau aggregation and P301S-tau transgenic mouse models in the context of genetic deletion of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR).
RESULTS: Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), a synthetic analog of viral nucleic acids, evoked a potent cytokine response that enhanced seeded aggregation of tau in an IFN-I-dependent manner. IFN-I-induced vulnerability could be pharmacologically prevented and was intrinsic to neurons. Aged P301S-tau mice lacking Ifnar1 had significantly reduced tau pathology compared to mice with intact IFN signaling.
DISCUSSION: We identify a critical role for IFN-I in potentiating tau aggregation. IFN-I is therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target in AD and other tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Type-I IFN (IFN-I) promotes seeded tau aggregation in neural cultures. IFNAR inhibition prevents IFN-I driven sensitivity to tau aggregation. IFN-I driven vulnerability is intrinsic to neurons. Tau pathology is significantly reduced in aged P301S-tau mice lacking IFNAR.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
37828730,"Unhealthy white matter connectivity, cognition, and racialization in older adults.","INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) may promote clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) disparities between Black American (BA) and non-Hispanic White (nHW) populations. Using a novel measurement, unhealthy white matter connectivity (UWMC), we interrogated racialized group differences in associations between WMH in AD pathology-affected regions and cognition.
METHODS: UWMC is the proportion of white matter fibers that pass through WMH for every pair of brain regions. Individual regression models tested associations of UWMC in beta-amyloid (Aβ) or tau pathology-affected regions with cognition overall, stratified by racialized group, and with a racialized group interaction.
RESULTS: In 201 older adults ranging from cognitively unimpaired to AD, BA participants exhibited greater UWMC and worse cognition than nHW participants. UWMC was negatively associated with cognition in 17 and 5 Aβ- and tau-affected regions, respectively. Racialization did not modify these relationships.
DISCUSSION: Differential UWMC burden, not differential UWMC-and-cognition associations, may drive clinical AD disparities between racialized groups.
HIGHLIGHTS: Unhealthy white matter connectivity (UWMC) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology-affected brain regions is associated with cognition. Relationships between UWMC and cognition are similar between Black American (BA) and non-Hispanic White (nHW) individuals. More UWMC may partially drive higher clinical AD burden in BA versus nHW populations. UWMC risk factors, particularly social and environmental, should be identified.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
38108158,Cerebrovascular reactivity in Alzheimer's disease signature regions is associated with mild cognitive impairment in adults with hypertension.,"INTRODUCTION: Vascular risk factors contribute to cognitive decline suggesting that maintaining cerebrovascular health could reduce dementia risk. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), a measure of brain blood vessel elasticity, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.
METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND) magnetic resonance imaging substudy. Baseline CVR in Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature regions were primary variables of interest. The occipital pole and postcentral gyrus were included as control regions.
RESULTS: Higher AD composite CVR was associated with lower MCI risk. No significant associations between inferior temporal gyrus, occipital pole, or postcentral gyrus CVR and MCI risk, or any regional CVR-combined risk associations were observed.
DISCUSSION: CVR in AD signature regions is negatively associated with occurrence of MCI, implicating CVR in AD signature regions as a potential mechanism leading to cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
38155914,Top Alzheimer's disease risk allele frequencies differ in HABS-HD Mexican- versus Non-Hispanic White Americans.,"INTRODUCTION: Here we evaluate frequencies of the top 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk alleles for late-onset AD in Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) American participants enrolled in the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities Study cohort. METHODS: Using DNA extracted from this community-based diverse population, we calculated the genotype frequencies in each population to determine whether a significant difference is detected between the different ethnicities. DNA genotyping was performed per manufacturers' protocols. RESULTS: Allele and genotype frequencies for 9 of the 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (two apolipoprotein E variants, CR1, BIN1, DRB1, NYAP1, PTK2B, FERMT2, and ABCA7) differed significantly between MAs and NHWs. DISCUSSION: The significant differences in frequencies of top AD risk alleles observed here across MAs and NHWs suggest that ethnicity-specific genetic risks for AD exist. Given our results, we are advancing additional projects to further elucidate ethnicity-specific differences in AD.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2023
38053753,Atrophy of specific amygdala subfields in subjects converting to mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence indicates that the amygdala exhibits early signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, it is still unknown whether the atrophy of distinct subfields of the amygdala also participates in the transition from healthy cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Our sample was derived from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative 3 and consisted of 97 cognitively healthy (HC) individuals, sorted into two groups based on their clinical follow-up: 75 who remained stable (s-HC) and 22 who converted to MCI within 48 months (c-HC). Anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images were analyzed using a semi-automatic approach that combines probabilistic methods and a priori information from ex vivo MR images and histology to segment and obtain quantitative structural metrics for different amygdala subfields in each participant. Spearman's correlations were performed between MR measures and baseline and longitudinal neuropsychological measures. We also included anatomical measurements of the whole amygdala, the hippocampus, a key target of AD-related pathology, and the whole cortical thickness as a test of spatial specificity.
RESULTS: Compared with s-HC individuals, c-HC subjects showed a reduced right amygdala volume, whereas no significant difference was observed for hippocampal volumes or changes in cortical thickness. In the amygdala subfields, we observed selected atrophy patterns in the basolateral nuclear complex, anterior amygdala area, and transitional area. Macro-structural alterations in these subfields correlated with variations of global indices of cognitive performance (measured at baseline and the 48-month follow-up), suggesting that amygdala changes shape the cognitive progression to MCI.
DISCUSSION: Our results provide anatomical evidence for the early involvement of the amygdala in the preclinical stages of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amygdala's atrophy marks elderly progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).Amygdala's was observed within the basolateral and amygdaloid complexes.Macro-structural alterations were associated with cognitive decline.No atrophy was found in the hippocampus and cortex.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2023
38102668,"A novel apoE-mimetic increases brain apoE levels, reduces Aβ pathology and improves memory when treated before onset of pathology in male mice that express APOE3.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive dysfunction and amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). APOE is the greatest genetic risk for AD with APOE4 increasing risk up to ~ 15-fold compared to APOE3. Evidence suggests that levels and lipidation of the apoE protein could regulate AD progression. In glia, apoE is lipidated via cholesterol efflux from intracellular pools, primarily by the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Therefore, increasing ABCA1 activity is suggested to be a therapeutic approach for AD. CS-6253 (CS) is a novel apoE mimetic peptide that was developed to bind and stabilize ABCA1 and maintain its localization into the plasma membrane therefore promoting cholesterol efflux. The goal of this study was to determine whether CS could modulate apoE levels and lipidation, Aβ pathology, and behavior in a model that expresses human APOE and overproduce Aβ.
METHODS: In vitro, APOE3-glia or APOE4-glia were treated with CS. In vivo, male and female, E3FAD (5xFAD<sup>+/-</sup>/APOE3<sup>+/+</sup>) and E4FAD (5xFAD<sup>+/-</sup>/APOE4<sup>+/+</sup>) mice were treated with CS via intraperitoneal injection at early (from 4 to 8 months of age) and late ages (from 8 to 10 months of age). ApoE levels, ABCA1 levels and, apoE lipidation were measured by western blot and ELISA. Aβ and amyloid levels were assessed by histochemistry and ELISA. Learning and memory were tested by Morris Water Maze and synaptic proteins were measured by Western blot.
RESULTS: CS treatment increased apoE levels and cholesterol efflux in primary glial cultures. In young male E3FAD mice, CS treatment increased soluble apoE and lipid-associated apoE, reduced soluble oAβ and insoluble Aβ levels as well as Aβ and amyloid deposition, and improved memory and synaptic protein levels. CS treatment did not induce any therapeutic benefits in young female E3FAD and E4FAD mice or in any groups when treatment was started at later ages.
CONCLUSIONS: CS treatment reduced Aβ pathology and improved memory only in young male E3FAD, the cohort with the least AD pathology. Therefore, the degree of Aβ pathology or Aβ overproduction may impact the ability of targeting ABCA1 to be an effective AD therapeutic. This suggests that ABCA1-stabilizing treatment by CS-6253 works best in conditions of modest Aβ levels.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2023
37387135,PPAD: a deep learning architecture to predict progression of Alzheimer's disease.,"MOTIVATION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary stage between cognitively normal state and AD. Not all people who have MCI convert to AD. The diagnosis of AD is made after significant symptoms of dementia such as short-term memory loss are already present. Since AD is currently an irreversible disease, diagnosis at the onset of the disease brings a huge burden on patients, their caregivers, and the healthcare sector. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop methods for the early prediction AD for patients who have MCI. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been successfully used to handle electronic health records (EHR) for predicting conversion from MCI to AD. However, RNN ignores irregular time intervals between successive events which occurs common in electronic health record data. In this study, we propose two deep learning architectures based on RNN, namely Predicting Progression of Alzheimer's Disease (PPAD) and PPAD-Autoencoder. PPAD and PPAD-Autoencoder are designed for early predicting conversion from MCI to AD at the next visit and multiple visits ahead for patients, respectively. To minimize the effect of the irregular time intervals between visits, we propose using age in each visit as an indicator of time change between successive visits.
RESULTS: Our experimental results conducted on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center datasets showed that our proposed models outperformed all baseline models for most prediction scenarios in terms of F2 and sensitivity. We also observed that the age feature was one of top features and was able to address irregular time interval problem.

37874022,"Localization of PDE4D, HCN1 channels, and mGluR3 in rhesus macaque entorhinal cortex may confer vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease cortical tau pathology initiates in the layer II cell clusters of entorhinal cortex, but it is not known why these specific neurons are so vulnerable. Aging macaques exhibit the same qualitative pattern of tau pathology as humans, including initial pathology in layer II entorhinal cortex clusters, and thus can inform etiological factors driving selective vulnerability. Macaque data have already shown that susceptible neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex express a ""signature of flexibility"" near glutamate synapses on spines, where cAMP-PKA magnification of calcium signaling opens nearby potassium and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels to dynamically alter synapse strength. This process is regulated by PDE4A/D, mGluR3, and calbindin, to prevent toxic calcium actions; regulatory actions that are lost with age/inflammation, leading to tau phosphorylation. The current study examined whether a similar ""signature of flexibility"" expresses in layer II entorhinal cortex, investigating the localization of PDE4D, mGluR3, and HCN1 channels. Results showed a similar pattern to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with PDE4D and mGluR3 positioned to regulate internal calcium release near glutamate synapses, and HCN1 channels concentrated on spines. As layer II entorhinal cortex stellate cells do not express calbindin, even when young, they may be particularly vulnerable to magnified calcium actions and ensuing tau pathology.",Cereb Cortex,2023
37491471,Quantification of race/ethnicity representation in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging research in the USA: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minoritized groups are disproportionately at risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but are not sufficiently recruited in AD neuroimaging research in the United States. This is important as sample composition impacts generalizability of findings, biomarker cutoffs, and treatment effects. No studies have quantified the breadth of race/ethnicity representation in the AD literature.
METHODS: This review identified median race/ethnicity composition of AD neuroimaging US-based research samples available as free full-text articles on PubMed. Two types of published studies were analyzed: studies that directly report race/ethnicity data (i.e., direct studies), and studies that do not report race/ethnicity but used data from a cohort study/database that does report this information (i.e., indirect studies).
RESULTS: Direct studies (n = 719) have median representation of 88.9% white or 87.4% Non-Hispanic white, 7.3% Black/African American, and 3.4% Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, with 0% Asian American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native, Multiracial, and Other Race participants. Cohort studies/databases (n = 44) from which indirect studies (n = 1745) derived are more diverse, with median representation of 84.2% white, 83.7% Non-Hispanic white, 11.6% Black/African American, 4.7% Hispanic/Latino, and 1.75% Asian American participants. Notably, 94% of indirect studies derive from just 10 cohort studies/databases. Comparisons of two time periods using a median split for publication year, 1994-2017 and 2018-2022, indicate that sample diversity has improved recently, particularly for Black/African American participants (3.39% from 1994-2017 and 8.29% from 2018-2022).
CONCLUSIONS: There is still underrepresentation of all minoritized groups relative to Census data, especially for Hispanic/Latino and Asian American individuals. The AD neuroimaging literature will benefit from increased representative recruitment of ethnic/racial minorities. More transparent reporting of race/ethnicity data is needed.",Commun Med (Lond),2023
37728486,Removal of extracellular human amyloid beta aggregates by extracellular proteases in C. elegans.,"The amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains contain collagens and are embedded extracellularly. Several collagens have been proposed to influence Aβ aggregate formation, yet their role in clearance is unknown. To investigate the potential role of collagens in forming and clearance of extracellular aggregates in vivo, we created a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain that expresses and secretes human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. This secreted Aβ forms aggregates in two distinct places within the extracellular matrix. In a screen for extracellular human Aβ aggregation regulators, we identified different collagens to ameliorate or potentiate Aβ aggregation. We show that a disintegrin and metalloprotease a disintegrin and metalloprotease 2 (ADM-2), an ortholog of ADAM9, reduces the load of extracellular Aβ aggregates. ADM-2 is required and sufficient to remove the extracellular Aβ aggregates. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of collagens essential for aggregate formation and metalloprotease participating in extracellular Aβ aggregate removal.",Elife,2023
38332809,Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paired with cognitive training on cognitive function in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL Complete (EBSCO), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang Database were searched. The risk of bias was appraised through the Cochrane collaboration tool. A meta-analysis was conducted, including an assessment of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 408 participants were included. The addition of rTMS significantly improved overall cognition in patients compared with cognitive intervention alone (p &lt; 0.05 for all tests). The treatment also had some continuity, with significant improvements in cognitive function within weeks after the treatment ended (p &lt; 0.05 for all tests).
CONCLUSION: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training (rTMS-CT) is a valuable technique for the cognitive rehabilitation of AD patients. It is beneficial to improve the cognitive ability of patients and restore their overall functional state. The results of the study may provide a basis for clinical providers to implement interventions that facilitate the design of more rigorous and high-quality interventions.
LIMITATIONS: The number of studies and sample size in our study were small. We did not explore possible interactions between rTMS and medications and mood improvement after rTMS due to inadequate data.

37895194,"INPP5D/SHIP1: Expression, Regulation and Roles in Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for approximately 38.5 million cases of all-cause dementia. Over 60% of these individuals live in low- and middle-income countries and are the worst affected, especially by its deleterious effects on the productivity of both patients and caregivers. Numerous risk factors for the disease have been identified and our understanding of gene-environment interactions have shed light on several gene variants that contribute to the most common, sporadic form of AD. Microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have long been established as guardians of the brain by providing neuroprotection and maintaining cellular homeostasis. A protein with a myriad of effects on various important signaling pathways that is expressed in microglia is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing Inositol 5' Phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein. Encoded by the INPP5D (Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase D) gene, SHIP1 has diminutive effects on most microglia signaling processes. Polymorphisms of the INPP5D gene have been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. Several studies have elucidated mechanistic processes by which SHIP1 exerts its perturbations on signaling processes in peripheral immune cells. However, current knowledge of the controllers of INPP5D/SHIP1 expression and the idiosyncrasies of its influences on signaling processes in microglia and their relevance to AD pathophysiology is limited. In this review, we summarize these discoveries and discuss the potential of leveraging INPP5D/SHIP1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",Genes (Basel),2023
37107688,Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease Associated with C9ORF72 Hexanucleotide Expansion: Further Evidence for a Still Unsolved Association.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are recognized as part of a disease continuum (FTD-ALS spectrum), in which the most common genetic cause is chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene hexanucleotide repeat expansion. The clinical phenotype of patients carrying this expansion varies widely and includes diseases beyond the FTD-ALS spectrum. Although a few cases of patients with C9ORF72 expansion and a clinical or biomarker-supported diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been described, they have been considered too sparse to establish a definite association between the C9ORF72 expansion and AD pathology. Here, we describe a C9ORF72 family with pleomorphic phenotypical expressions: a 54-year-old woman showing cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances with both neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers consistent with AD pathology, her 49-year-old brother with typical FTD-ALS, and their 63-year-old mother with the behavioral variant of FTD and CSF biomarkers suggestive of AD pathology. The young onset of disease in all three family members and their different phenotypes and biomarker profiles make the simple co-occurrence of different diseases an extremely unlikely explanation. Our report adds to previous findings and may contribute to further expanding the spectrum of diseases associated with C9ORF72 expansion.",Genes (Basel),2023
35473418,Mediators of cognitive impairment in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with cognitive decline. CAA has diverse impacts on brain structure and function; however, the brain lesions that mediate the association of CAA with cognition are not understood well.
AIMS: To determine the degree to which CAA neuroimaging biomarkers mediate the association of CAA with cognitive dysfunction.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data of patients with probable CAA and controls without cognitive impairment from the Functional Assessment of Vascular Reactivity study. Neuropsychological tests were grouped into domains of memory, executive function, and processing speed. Candidate CAA neuroimaging biomarkers were pre-specified based on prior literature, consisting of white matter hyperintensity volume, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), cortical thickness, and cortical thickness in a meta-region of interest typically affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive scores and neuroimaging markers were standardized and reported in relation to values in controls. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the total effect of CAA on cognition and the proportion of the total effect that was mediated by neuroimaging biomarkers, controlling for age, sex, and education.
RESULTS: There were 131 participants (67 CAA and 64 controls). Mean age was 72.1 ± 7.7 years, and 54.2% were women. As expected, compared to controls, CAA was associated with lower cognition. In mediation analyses, CAA had direct unmediated effects of 48%, 46%, and 52% on all three cognitive domains. The association of CAA with memory was partially mediated by CVR and PSMD, accounting for 18% and 36% of the total effect of CAA. The association of CAA with executive function was partially mediated by PSMD and mean cortical thickness in the AD meta-region of interest (ROI), accounting for 33% and 31% of the total effect of CAA. The association of CAA with processing speed was partially mediated by CVR and PSMD, accounting for 8% and 34% of the total effect of CAA. Among CAA participants, the presence of cortical superficial siderosis was associated with lower processing speed.
CONCLUSION: Altered white matter diffusivity (i.e. PSMD), CVR, and atrophy, taken together, account for about half the effect of CAA on cognition.",Int J Stroke,2023
38007663,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Intervention in Alzheimer's Disease and Its Follow-Up.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the prevailing type of dementia, marked by gradual memory loss and cognitive decline. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method used to regulate cortical brain function and has been explored as a potential treatment for cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effects of daily home-based active or sham tDCS on cognitive function in patients with early-stage AD and its follow-up after one month.
METHODS: The study involved a randomized, blinded, and controlled-placebo design, with 18 participants enrolled. The primary outcome measures were general cognitive function, immediate, and delayed recall, and executive function. Participants included in the study were randomly assigned to the anodal and sham tDCS groups. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention and one month after the end of treatment. The home-based intervention was applied for 5 consecutive days, daily.
RESULTS: The results showed a significant interaction between the active and sham groups; in particular, improvements in MMSE scores, immediate memory and delayed recall were observed at one-month follow-up in the active group.
CONCLUSIONS: The positive effects of tDCS on cognitive function in AD patients observed suggest that tDCS may induce long-term neuroplastic changes, leading to sustained improvements in cognitive abilities.",J Alzheimers Dis,2023

Relationships between immune function and inflammation with cognition are well-established in AD, but the Th1/Th2 ratio of immune function is unknown. Describing the Th1/Th2 ratio and its relationship with cognition may shed light on the disease's clinical context. How the Th1/Th2 ratio responds to dietary supplementation is another unknown question in this population.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to: 1) characterize the Th1/Th2 ratio according to IL-2/IL-10, IFN-γ/IL-10, IL-2/IL-4, IFN-γ/IL-4, IL-2/TNF-α, and IFN-γ/TNF-α in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and in comparison to healthy adults; 2) investigate the effect of an aloe polymannose multinutrient complex (APMC) dietary supplement on the Th1/Th2 ratios over 12 months; and 3) compare the changes in the Th1/Th2 ratios with the changes in cognition from baseline to 12 months.
METHODS: Subjects consumed 2.5 g of the APMC four times per day for 12 months, and they were assessed on cognition and cytokines at baseline and 12 months.
RESULTS: The Th1/Th2 ratios in AD patients were significantly higher than the healthy controls, and five of the six ratios decreased from baseline to 12 months follow-up (other than IL-2/TNF-α). Several significant relationships were noted between the changes in Th1/Th2 ratios with cognitive assessments.

OBJECTIVE: To develop tertiary and primary care-based dementia CQIs for application to clinical registries for individuals with dementia accessing aged care services and determine 1) annual trends in CQI incidence between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016, 2) associated factors, and 3) geographic and facility variation in CQI incidence.
METHODS: This retrospective repeated cross-sectional study included non-Indigenous individuals aged 65-105 years who lived with dementia between July 2008-June 2016, were assessed for government-funded aged care services, and resided in New South Wales or Victoria (n = 180,675). Poisson or negative binomial regression models estimated trends in annual CQI incidence and associated factors. Funnel plots examined CQI variation.
RESULTS: Between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016, CQI incidence increased for falls (11.0% to 13.9%, adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.06)) and delirium (4.7% to 6.7%, aIRR 1.09 (95% CI 1.07-1.10)), decreased for unplanned hospitalizations (28.7% to 27.9%, aIRR 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99)) and remained steady for fracture (6.2% to 6.5%, aIRR 1.01 (95% CI 0.99-1.01)) and pressure injuries (0.5% to 0.4%, aIRR 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.02)). Being male, older, having more comorbidities and living in a major city were associated with higher CQI incidence. Considerable geographical and facility variation was observed for unplanned hospitalizations and delirium CQIs.
CONCLUSIONS: The CQI results highlighted considerable morbidity. The CQIs tested should be considered for application in clinical quality registries to monitor dementia care quality.",J Alzheimers Dis,2023

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a prognostic risk prediction modeling study based on cohort data (Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative [ADNI]; n = 365) of research participants with MCI and elicited expert data. Bayesian Cox models were used to combine expert knowledge and ADNI data to predict dementia progression in people with MCI. Posterior distributions were obtained based on Gibbs sampler and the predictive performance was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation via c-index, integrated calibration index (ICI), and integrated brier score (IBS).
RESULTS: 365 people with MCI were included, mean age was 73 years (SD = 7.5), and 39% developed dementia within 3 years. When expert knowledge was incorporated, the c-index, ICI, and IBS values were 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.79), 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.08), and 0.17 (95% CI 0.14-0.19), respectively. These were similar to the model without expert knowledge data.

38068253,The Interplay between Cannabinoid Receptors and Microglia in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by massive neuronal death, brain atrophy, and loss of neurons and synapses, which all lead to a progressive cognitive decline. Neuroinflammation has been recently identified as one of the main causes of AD progression, and microglia cells are considered to have a central role in this process. Growing evidence suggests that cannabinoids may be used as preventive treatment for AD. An altered expression of the endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their receptors (CBRs) is reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. Moreover, the modulation of CBRs demonstrated neuroprotective effects in reducing aggregated protein deposition, suggesting the therapeutic potential of natural and synthetic CBR ligands in the treatment of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the involvement of CBRs in the modulation of microglia activation phenotypes, highlighting the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, like AD. We also provide an overview of recently developed candidate drugs targeting CBRs that may afford a new innovative strategy for the treatment and management of AD.",J Clin Med,2023
37966908,Cognitive symptoms progress with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy stage and co-occurrence with Alzheimer disease.,"Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is a neuropathologic entity characterized by transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43-kDa (TDP-43)-immunoreactive inclusions that originate in the amygdala and then progress to the hippocampi and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC may mimic Alzheimer disease clinically and often co-occurs with Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). This report focuses on the cognitive effects of isolated and concomitant LATE-NC and ADNC. Cognitive/neuropsychological, neuropathologic, genetic, and demographic variables were analyzed in 28 control, 31 isolated LATE-NC, 244 isolated ADNC, and 172 concurrent LATE-NC/ADNC subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Cases with LATE-NC and ADNC were significantly older than controls; cases with ADNC had a significantly higher proportion of cases with at least one APOE ε4 allele. Both LATE-NC and ADNC exhibited deleterious effects on overall cognition proportional to their neuropathological stages; concurrent LATE-NC/ADNC exhibited the worst overall cognitive effect. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined an independent risk of cognitive impairment for progressive LATE-NC stages (OR 1.66; p = 0.0256) and ADNC levels (OR 3.41; p < 0.0001). These data add to the existing knowledge on the clinical consequences of LATE-NC pathology and the growing literature on the effects of multiple concurrent neurodegenerative pathologies.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,2023

37986179,Alzheimer's genes in microglia: a risk worth investigating.,"Despite expressing many key risk genes, the role of microglia in late-onset Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is somewhat ambiguous, with various phenotypes reported to be either harmful or protective. Herein, we review some key findings from clinical and animal model investigations, discussing the role of microglial genetics in mediating perturbations from homeostasis. We note that impairment to protective phenotypes may include prolonged or insufficient microglial activation, resulting in dysregulated metabolomic (notably lipid-related) processes, compounded by age-related inflexibility in dynamic responses. Insufficiencies of mouse genetics and aggressive transgenic modelling imply severe limitations in applying current methodologies for aetiological investigations. Despite the shortcomings, widely used amyloidosis and tauopathy models of the disease have proven invaluable in dissecting microglial functional responses to AD pathophysiology. Some recent advances have brought modelling tools closer to human genetics, increasing the validity of both aetiological and translational endeavours.",Mol Neurodegener,2023

38041158,Sleep restoration by optogenetic targeting of GABAergic neurons reprograms microglia and ameliorates pathological phenotypes in an Alzheimer's disease model.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit memory disruptions and profound sleep disturbances, including disruption of deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Slow-wave activity (SWA) is a major restorative feature of NREM sleep and is important for memory consolidation.
METHODS: We generated a mouse model where GABAergic interneurons could be targeted in the presence of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) amyloidosis, APP-GAD-Cre mice. An electroencephalography (EEG) / electromyography (EMG) telemetry system was used to monitor sleep disruptions in these animals. Optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic interneurons in the anterior cortex targeted with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) allowed us to examine the role GABAergic interneurons play in sleep deficits. We also examined the effect of optogenetic stimulation on amyloid plaques, neuronal calcium as well as sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In addition, microglial morphological features and functions were assessed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Finally, we performed sleep deprivation during optogenetic stimulation to investigate whether sleep restoration was necessary to slow AD progression.
RESULTS: APP-GAD-Cre mice exhibited impairments in sleep architecture including decreased time spent in NREM sleep, decreased delta power, and increased sleep fragmentation compared to nontransgenic (NTG) NTG-GAD-Cre mice. Optogenetic stimulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons increased SWA and rescued sleep impairments in APP-GAD-Cre animals. Furthermore, it slowed AD progression by reducing amyloid deposition, normalizing neuronal calcium homeostasis, and improving memory function. These changes were accompanied by increased numbers and a morphological transformation of microglia, elevated phagocytic marker expression, and enhanced amyloid β (Aβ) phagocytic activity of microglia. Sleep was necessary for amelioration of pathophysiological phenotypes in APP-GAD-Cre mice.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study shows that optogenetic targeting of GABAergic interneurons rescues sleep, which then ameliorates neuropathological as well as behavioral deficits by increasing clearance of Aβ by microglia in an AD mouse model.",Mol Neurodegener,2023
38102484,Peripheral immune function and Alzheimer's disease: a living systematic review and critical appraisal.,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature examines the relationship between peripheral immune function and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in human populations. Our living systematic review summarizes the characteristics and findings of these studies, appraises their quality, and formulates recommendations for future research.
METHODS: We searched the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, and reviewed references of previous reviews and meta-analyses to identify human studies examining the relationship between any peripheral immune biomarkers and AD up to September 7th, 2023. We examined patterns of reported statistical associations (positive, negative, and null) between each biomarker and AD across studies. Evidence for each biomarker was categorized into four groups based on the proportion of studies reporting different associations: corroborating a positive association with AD, a negative association, a null association, and presenting contradictory findings. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was employed to assess the quality of the included studies.
FINDINGS: In total, 286 studies were included in this review. The majority were cross-sectional (n = 245, 85.7%) and hospital-based (n = 248, 86.7%), examining relationships between 187 different peripheral immune biomarkers and AD. Cytokines were the most frequently studied group of peripheral immune biomarkers. Evidence supported a positive association with AD for six biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ, ACT, IL-18, and IL-12, and a negative association for two biomarkers, including lymphocytes and IL-6R. Only a small proportion of included studies (n = 22, 7.7%) were deemed to be of high quality based on quality assessment.
INTERPRETATION: Existing research on peripheral immune function and AD exhibits substantial methodological variations and limitations, with a notable lack of longitudinal, population-based studies investigating a broad range of biomarkers with prospective AD outcomes. The extent and manner in which peripheral immune function can contribute to AD pathophysiology remain open questions. Given the biomarkers that we identified to be associated with AD, we posit that targeting peripheral immune dysregulation may present a promising intervention point to reduce the burden of AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2023
37670126,Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome for neurodegenerative disorders.,"Neuroinflammation is a key pathological feature in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins (NLRs) belong to the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) family that sense stress signals, which play an important role in inflammation. As a member of NLRs, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is predominantly expressed in microglia, the principal innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia release proinflammatory cytokines to cause pyroptosis through activating NLRP3 inflammasome. The active NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Recent studies also indicate the key role of neuronal NLRP3 in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. In this article, we reviewed the mechanisms of NLRP3 expression and activation and discussed the role of active NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of NDs, particularly focusing on AD. The studies suggest that targeting NLRP3 inflammasome could be a novel approach for the disease modification.",Mol Psychiatry,2023
38135757,ABCA7 deficiency causes neuronal dysregulation by altering mitochondrial lipid metabolism.,"ABCA7 loss-of-function variants are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using ABCA7 knockout human iPSC models generated with CRISPR/Cas9, we investigated the impacts of ABCA7 deficiency on neuronal metabolism and function. Lipidomics revealed that mitochondria-related phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were reduced in the ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived cortical organoids. Consistently, ABCA7 deficiency-induced alterations of mitochondrial morphology accompanied by reduced ATP synthase activity and exacerbated oxidative damage in the organoids. Furthermore, ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived neurons showed compromised mitochondrial respiration and excess ROS generation, as well as enlarged mitochondrial morphology compared to the isogenic controls. ABCA7 deficiency also decreased spontaneous synaptic firing and network formation in iPSC-derived neurons, in which the effects were rescued by supplementation with phosphatidylglycerol or NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide. Importantly, effects of ABCA7 deficiency on mitochondria morphology and synapses were recapitulated in synaptosomes isolated from the brain of neuron-specific Abca7 knockout mice. Together, our results provide evidence that ABCA7 loss-of-function contributes to AD risk by modulating mitochondria lipid metabolism.",Mol Psychiatry,2023
38012285,TANGO: a placebo-controlled randomized phase 2 study of efficacy and safety of the anti-tau monoclonal antibody gosuranemab in early Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease, the spread of aberrantly phosphorylated tau is an important criterion in the Braak staging of disease severity and correlates with disease symptomatology. Here, we report the results of TANGO ( NCT03352557 ), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multiple-dose long-term trial of gosuranemab-a monoclonal antibody to N-terminal tau-in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of gosuranemab compared to placebo. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of multiple doses of gosuranemab in slowing cognitive and functional impairment (using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores at week 78) and evaluate the immunogenicity of gosuranemab (using the incidence of anti-gosuranemab antibody responses). Participants were randomized (n = 654); received (n = 650) low-dose (125 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w), n = 58; 375 mg q12w, n = 58), intermediate-dose (600 mg q4w, n = 106) or high-dose (2,000 mg q4w, n = 214) gosuranemab or placebo (q4w, n = 214) intravenously for 78 weeks; and assigned to cerebrospinal fluid (n = 327) and/or tau positron emission tomography (n = 357) biomarker substudies. Gosuranemab had an acceptable safety profile and was generally well tolerated (incidence of serious adverse events: placebo, 12.1%; low dose, 10.3%; intermediate dose, 12.3%; high dose, 11.7%). The incidence of treatment-emergent gosuranemab antibody responses was low at all time points. No significant effects were identified in cognitive and functional tests as no dose resulted in a favorable change from the baseline CDR-SB score at week 78 compared to placebo control (adjusted mean change: placebo, 1.85; low dose, 2.20; intermediate dose, 2.24; high dose, 1.85). At week 76, all doses caused significant (P < 0.0001) reductions in the cerebrospinal fluid levels of unbound N-terminal tau compared to placebo.",Nat Aging,2023
37891164,Multivalent Tau/PSD-95 interactions arrest in vitro condensates and clusters mimicking the postsynaptic density.,"Alzheimer's disease begins with mild memory loss and slowly destroys memory and thinking. Cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease has been associated with the localization of the microtubule-associated protein Tau at the postsynapse. However, the correlation between Tau at the postsynapse and synaptic dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we show that Tau arrests liquid-like droplets formed by the four postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GKAP, Shank, Homer in solution, as well as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-associated protein clusters on synthetic membranes. Tau-mediated condensate/cluster arrest critically depends on the binding of multiple interaction motifs of Tau to a canonical GMP-binding pocket in the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95. We further reveal that competitive binding of a high-affinity phosphorylated peptide to PSD-95 rescues the diffusional dynamics of an NMDA truncated construct, which contains the last five amino acids of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B fused to the C-terminus of the tetrameric GCN4 coiled-coil domain, in postsynaptic density-like condensates/clusters. Taken together, our findings propose a molecular mechanism where Tau modulates the dynamic properties of the postsynaptic density.",Nat Commun,2023
38012153,Resting-state global brain activity affects early β-amyloid accumulation in default mode network.,"It remains unclear why β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque, a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), first accumulates cortically in the default mode network (DMN), years before AD diagnosis. Resting-state low-frequency ( < 0.1 Hz) global brain activity recently was linked to AD, presumably due to its role in glymphatic clearance. Here we show that the preferential Aβ accumulation in the DMN at the early stage of Aβ pathology was associated with the preferential reduction of global brain activity in the same regions. This can be partly explained by its failure to reach these regions as propagating waves. Together, these findings highlight the important role of resting-state global brain activity in early preferential Aβ deposition in the DMN.",Nat Commun,2023
38123547,ANKS1A regulates LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated cerebrovascular clearance in brain endothelial cells.,"Brain endothelial LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is involved in the clearance of Aβ peptides across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here we show that endothelial deficiency of ankyrin repeat and SAM domain containing 1 A (ANKS1A) reduces both the cell surface levels of LRP1 and the Aβ clearance across the BBB. Association of ANKS1A with the NPXY motifs of LRP1 facilitates the transport of LRP1 from the endoplasmic reticulum toward the cell surface. ANKS1A deficiency in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model results in exacerbated Aβ pathology followed by cognitive impairments. These deficits are reversible by gene therapy with brain endothelial-specific ANKS1A. In addition, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived BBBs (iBBBs) were generated from endothelial cells lacking ANKS1A or carrying the rs6930932 variant. Those iBBBs exhibit both reduced cell surface LRP1 and impaired Aβ clearance. Thus, our findings demonstrate that ANKS1A regulates LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance across the BBB.",Nat Commun,2023
37714837,C<sub>3</sub>N nanodots inhibits Aβ peptides aggregation pathogenic path in Alzheimer's disease.,"Despite the accumulating evidence linking the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the aggregation of Aβ peptides and the emergence of Aβ oligomers, the FDA has approved very few anti-aggregation-based therapies over the past several decades. Here, we report the discovery of an Aβ peptide aggregation inhibitor: an ultra-small nanodot called C<sub>3</sub>N. C<sub>3</sub>N nanodots alleviate aggregation-induced neuron cytotoxicity, rescue neuronal death, and prevent neurite damage in vitro. Importantly, they reduce the global cerebral Aβ peptides levels, particularly in fibrillar amyloid plaques, and restore synaptic loss in AD mice. Consequently, these C<sub>3</sub>N nanodots significantly ameliorate behavioral deficits of APP/PS1 double transgenic male AD mice. Moreover, analysis of critical tissues (e.g., heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) display no obvious pathological damage, suggesting C<sub>3</sub>N nanodots are biologically safe. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations also reveal the inhibitory mechanisms of C<sub>3</sub>N nanodots in Aβ peptides aggregation and its potential application against AD.",Nat Commun,2023
37723137,Circular RNAs in the human brain are tailored to neuron identity and neuropsychiatric disease.,"Little is known about circular RNAs (circRNAs) in specific brain cells and human neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we systematically identify over 11,039 circRNAs expressed in vulnerable dopamine and pyramidal neurons laser-captured from 190 human brains and non-neuronal cells using ultra-deep, total RNA sequencing. 1526 and 3308 circRNAs are custom-tailored to the cell identity of dopamine and pyramidal neurons and enriched in synapse pathways. 29% of Parkinson's and 12% of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes produced validated circRNAs. circDNAJC6, which is transcribed from a juvenile-onset Parkinson's gene, is already dysregulated during prodromal, onset stages of common Parkinson's disease neuropathology. Globally, addiction-associated genes preferentially produce circRNAs in dopamine neurons, autism-associated genes in pyramidal neurons, and cancers in non-neuronal cells. This study shows that circular RNAs in the human brain are tailored to neuron identity and implicate circRNA-regulated synaptic specialization in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Nat Commun,2023
37386110,Mendelian randomization evidence for the causal effects of socio-economic inequality on human longevity among Europeans.,"Human longevity correlates with socio-economic status, and there is evidence that educational attainment increases human lifespan. However, to inform meaningful health policies, we need fine-grained causal evidence on which dimensions of socio-economic status affect longevity and the mediating roles of modifiable factors such as lifestyle and disease. Here we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses applying genetic instruments of education, income and occupation (n = 248,847 to 1,131,881) to estimate their causal effects and consequences on parental lifespan and self-longevity (n = 28,967 to 1,012,240) from the largest available genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry. Each 4.20 years of additional educational attainment were causally associated with a 3.23-year-longer parental lifespan independently of income and occupation and were causally associated with 30-59% higher odds of self-longevity, suggesting that education was the primary determinant. By contrast, each one-standard-deviation-higher income and one-point-higher occupation was causally associated with 3.06-year-longer and 1.29-year-longer parental lifespans, respectively, but not independently of the other socio-economic indicators. We found no evidence for causal effects of income or occupation on self-longevity. Mediation analyses conducted in predominantly European-descent individuals through two-step Mendelian randomization suggested that among 59 candidates, cigarettes per day, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, heart failure and lung cancer individually played substantial mediating roles (proportion mediated, >10%) in the effect of education on specific longevity outcomes. These findings inform interventions for remediating longevity disparities attributable to socio-economic inequality.",Nat Hum Behav,2023
37667136,Emerging diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common contributor to dementia in the world, but strategies that slow or prevent its clinical progression have largely remained elusive, until recently. This Review highlights the latest advances in biomarker technologies and therapeutic development to improve AD diagnosis and treatment. We review recent results that enable pathological staging of AD with neuroimaging and fluid-based biomarkers, with a particular emphasis on the role of amyloid, tau and neuroinflammation in disease pathogenesis. We discuss the lessons learned from randomized controlled trials, including some supporting the proposal that certain anti-amyloid antibodies slow cognitive decline during the mildly symptomatic phase of AD. In addition, we highlight evidence for newly identified therapeutic targets that may be able to modify AD pathogenesis and progression. Collectively, these recent discoveries-and the research directions that they open-have the potential to move AD clinical care toward disease-modifying treatment strategies with maximal benefits for patients.",Nat Med,2023
37925995,Associations between recall of proper names in story recall and CSF amyloid and tau in adults without cognitive impairment.,"Neuropsychological measures sensitive to decline in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease are needed. We previously demonstrated that higher amyloid-beta (Aβ) assessed by positron emission tomography in adults without cognitive impairment was associated with recall of fewer proper names in Logical Memory story recall. The current study investigated the association between proper names and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, phosphorylated tau<sub>181</sub> [pTau<sub>181</sub>], neurofilament light) in 223 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. We assessed associations between biomarkers and delayed Logical Memory total score and proper names using binary logistic regressions. Sensitivity analyses used multinomial logistic regression and stratified biomarker groups. Lower Logical Memory total score and proper names scores from the most recent visit were associated with biomarker positivity. Relatedly, there was a 27% decreased risk of being classified Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>+/pTau<sub>181</sub>+ for each additional proper name recalled. A linear mixed effects model found that longitudinal change in proper names recall was predicted by biomarker status. These results demonstrate a novel relationship between proper names and Alzheimer's disease-cerebrospinal fluid pathology.",Neurobiol Aging,2023
37992545,Dopamine transporter positron emission tomography in patients with Alzheimer's disease with Lewy body disease features.,"In 36 normal controls (NC), 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) without parkinsonism (AD<sup>P-</sup>), 31 AD with parkinsonism (AD<sup>P+</sup>), and 40 AD with dementia with Lewy bodies (AD<sup>DLB</sup>), dual-phase dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomography (PET) were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DAT and early-to-delayed uptake ratios (E/Ds) in the anterior caudate (AC), posterior caudate (PC), anterior putamen (AP), posterior putamen (PP), and substantia nigra (SN) to differentiate AD<sup>P+</sup>/AD<sup>DLB</sup> from NC, and their effects on parkinsonism and cognition. DAT-SN and E/D-PP showed higher accuracies to differentiate AD<sup>P+</sup>/AD<sup>DLB</sup> from NC than DAT-PP. Among AD patients, lower DAT in the putamen and PC and higher E/Ds in the striatum were associated with severe parkinsonism, while higher E/Ds in the putamen, PC, and SN were associated with executive dysfunction. Our results suggest that decreased DAT-SN and increased E/D-PP could be biomarkers differentiating AD<sup>P+</sup>/AD<sup>DLB</sup> from pure AD and controls. Meanwhile, increased E/Ds in the putamen could reflect the severity of DLB presenting with parkinsonism and executive dysfunction among AD patients.",Neurobiol Aging,2023
37837732,Protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum rescues Aβ toxicity in Drosophila.,"Amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In adult Drosophila brains, human Aβ overexpression harms climbing and lifespan. It's uncertain whether Aβ is intrinsically toxic or activates downstream neurodegeneration pathways. Our study uncovers a novel protective role against Aβ toxicity: intra-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein accumulation with a focus on laminin and collagen subunits. Despite high Aβ, laminin B1 (LanB1) overexpression robustly counters toxicity, suggesting a potential Aβ resistance mechanism. Other laminin subunits and collagen IV also alleviate Aβ toxicity; combining them with LanB1 augments the effect. Imaging reveals ER retention of LanB1 without altering Aβ secretion. LanB1's rescue function operates independently of the IRE1α/XBP1 ER stress response. ER-targeted GFP overexpression also mitigates Aβ toxicity, highlighting broader ER protein retention advantages. Proof-of-principle tests in murine hippocampal slices using mouse Lamb1 demonstrate ER retention in transduced cells, indicating a conserved mechanism. Though ER protein retention generally harms, it could paradoxically counter neuronal Aβ toxicity, offering a new therapeutic avenue for Alzheimer's disease.",Neurobiol Aging,2023
38056216,Disease trajectories in older adults with non-AD pathologic change and comparison with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology: A longitudinal study.,"Based on the 'AT(N)' system, individuals with normal amyloid biomarkers but abnormal tauopathy or neurodegeneration biomarkers are classified as non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologic change. This study aimed to assess the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories of individuals with non-AD pathologic change among older adults without dementia, comparing them to those with normal AD biomarkers and AD pathophysiology. Analyzing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data, we evaluated clinical outcomes and conversion risk longitudinally using mixed effects models and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. We found that compared to individuals with A-T-N-, those with abnormal tauopathy or neurodegeneration biomarkers (A-T + N-, A-T-N + , and A-T + N + ) had a faster rate of cognitive decline and disease progression. Individuals with A-T + N + had a faster rate of decline than those with A-T + N-. Additionally, in individuals with the same baseline tauopathy and neurodegeneration biomarker status, the presence of baseline amyloid could accelerate cognitive decline and clinical progression. These findings provide a foundation for future studies on non-AD pathologic change and its comparison with AD pathophysiology.",Neurobiol Aging,2023
38376885,"In vivo tau is associated with change in memory and processing speed, but not reasoning, in cognitively unimpaired older adults.","The relationship between tau deposition and cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older adults is still unclear. The tau PET tracer <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 has shown favorable imaging characteristics to identify early tau deposition in aging. We evaluated the relationship between in vivo tau levels (<sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240) and retrospective cognitive change over 5 years in episodic memory, processing speed, and reasoning. For tau quantification, a set of regions of interest (ROIs) was selected a priori based on previous literature: (1) total-ROI comprising selected areas, (2) medial temporal lobe-ROI, and (3) lateral temporal lobe-ROI and cingulate/parietal lobe-ROI. Higher tau burden in most ROIs was associated with a steeper decline in memory and speed. There were no associations between tau and reasoning change. The novelty of this finding is that tau burden may affect not only episodic memory, a well-established finding but also processing speed. Our finding reinforces the notion that early tau deposition in areas related to Alzheimer's disease is associated with cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals, even in a sample with low amyloid-β pathology.",Neurobiol Aging,2023

37747929,TDP-43 pathology in Drosophila induces glial-cell type specific toxicity that can be ameliorated by knock-down of SF2/SRSF1.,"Accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is seen in both neurons and glia in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease progression involves non-cell autonomous interactions among multiple cell types, including neurons, microglia and astrocytes. We investigated the effects in Drosophila of inducible, glial cell type-specific TDP-43 overexpression, a model that causes TDP-43 protein pathology including loss of nuclear TDP-43 and accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions. We report that TDP-43 pathology in Drosophila is sufficient to cause progressive loss of each of the 5 glial sub-types. But the effects on organismal survival were most pronounced when TDP-43 pathology was induced in the perineural glia (PNG) or astrocytes. In the case of PNG, this effect is not attributable to loss of the glial population, because ablation of these glia by expression of pro-apoptotic reaper expression has relatively little impact on survival. To uncover underlying mechanisms, we used cell-type-specific nuclear RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptional changes induced by pathological TDP-43 expression. We identified numerous glial cell-type specific transcriptional changes. Notably, SF2/SRSF1 levels were found to be decreased in both PNG and in astrocytes. We found that further knockdown of SF2/SRSF1 in either PNG or astrocytes lessens the detrimental effects of TDP-43 pathology on lifespan, but extends survival of the glial cells. Thus TDP-43 pathology in astrocytes or PNG causes systemic effects that shorten lifespan and SF2/SRSF1 knockdown rescues the loss of these glia, and also reduces their systemic toxicity to the organism.",PLoS Genet,2023
38014237,Human brain single nucleus cell type enrichments in neurodegenerative diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing has opened a window into clarifying the complex underpinnings of disease, particularly in quantifying the relevance of tissue- and cell-type-specific gene expression.
METHODS: To identify the cell types and genes important to therapeutic target development across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, we leveraged genome-wide association studies, recent single-cell sequencing data, and bulk expression studies in a diverse series of brain region tissues.
RESULTS: We were able to identify significant immune-related cell types in the brain across three major neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Subsequently, putative roles of 30 fine-mapped loci implicating seven genes in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and their pathogenesis were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: We have helped refine the genetic regions and cell types effected across multiple neurodegenerative diseases, helping focus future translational research efforts.",Res Sq,2023
38045363,Novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a methylase blocks Alzheimer's disease proteopathology for precision medication.,"Current amyloid beta-targeting approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics only slow cognitive decline for small numbers of patients. This limited efficacy exists because AD is a multifactorial disease whose pathological mechanism(s) and diagnostic biomarkers are largely unknown. Here we report a new mechanism of AD pathogenesis in which the histone methyltransferase G9a noncanonically regulates translation of a hippocampal proteome that defines the proteopathic nature of AD. Accordingly, we developed a novel brain-penetrant inhibitor of G9a, MS1262, across the blood-brain barrier to block this G9a-regulated, proteopathologic mechanism. Intermittent MS1262 treatment of multiple AD mouse models consistently restored both cognitive and noncognitive functions to healthy levels. Comparison of proteomic/phosphoproteomic analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human AD patient data identified multiple pathological brain pathways that elaborate amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles as well as blood coagulation, from which biomarkers of early stage of AD including SMOC1 were found to be affected by MS1262 treatment. Notably, these results indicated that MS1262 treatment may reduce or avoid the risk of blood clot burst for brain bleeding or a stroke. This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteopathology suggests that the global, multifaceted effects of MS1262 in mice could extend to relieve all symptoms of AD patients with minimum side effect. In addition, our mechanistically derived biomarkers can be used for stage-specific AD diagnosis and companion diagnosis of individualized drug effects.",Res Sq,2023
38168287,Voxel-wise Fusion of Resting fMRI Networks and Gray Matter Volume for Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Deep Multimodal Learning.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder requiring accurate and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and gray matter volume analysis from structural MRI have emerged as valuable tools for investigating AD-related brain alterations. However, the potential benefits of integrating these modalities using deep learning techniques remain unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel framework that fuses composite images of multiple rs-fMRI networks (called voxelwise intensity projection) and gray matter segmentation images through a deep learning approach for improved AD classification. We demonstrate the superiority of fMRI networks over commonly used metrics such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF in capturing spatial maps critical for AD classification. We use a multi-channel convolutional neural network incorporating the AlexNet dropout architecture to effectively model spatial and temporal dependencies in the integrated data. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset of AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing improved classification performance of 94.12% test accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) score of 97.79 compared to existing methods. Our results show that the fusion results generally outperformed the unimodal results. The saliency visualizations also show significant differences in the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate nucleus, and regions of basal ganglia which are in line with the previous neurobiological literature. Our research offers a novel method to enhance our grasp of AD pathology. By integrating data from various functional networks with structural MRI insights, we significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. This accuracy is further boosted by the effective visualization of this combined information. This lays the groundwork for further studies focused on providing a more accurate and personalized approach to AD diagnosis. The proposed framework and insights gained from fMRI networks provide a promising avenue for future research in deep multimodal fusion and neuroimaging analysis.",Res Sq,2023
38062190,Hypertension linked to Alzheimer's disease via stroke: Mendelian randomization.,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hypertension and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and demonstrate the key role of stroke in this relationship using mediating Mendelian randomization. AD, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss, cognitive impairment, and behavioral abnormalities, severely affects the quality of life of patients. Hypertension is an important risk factor for AD. However, the precise mechanism underlying this relationship is unclear. To investigate the relationship between hypertension and AD, we used a mediated Mendelian randomization method and screened for mediating variables between hypertension and AD by setting instrumental variables. The results of the mediated analysis showed that stroke, as a mediating variable, plays an important role in the causal relationship between hypertension and AD. Specifically, the mediated indirect effect value for stroke obtained using multivariate mediated MR analysis was 54.9%. This implies that approximately 55% of the risk of AD owing to hypertension can be attributed to stroke. The results suggest that the increased risk of AD owing to hypertension is mediated through stroke. The finding not only sheds light on the relationship between hypertension and AD but also indicates novel methods for the prevention and treatment of AD. By identifying the critical role of stroke in the link between hypertension and AD, this study provides insights into potential interventions that could mitigate the impact of hypertension on AD. This could help develop personalized treatments and help improve the quality of life of patients with AD who suffer from hypertension.",Sci Rep,2023
38036591,Low-dose brain radiation: lowering hyperphosphorylated-tau without increasing DNA damage or oncogenic activation.,"Brain radiation has been medically used to alter the metabolism of cancerous cells and induce their elimination. Rarely, though, brain radiation has been used to interfere with the pathomechanisms of non-cancerous brain disorders, especially neurodegenerative disorders. Data from low-dose radiation (LDR) on swine brains demonstrated reduced levels of phosphorylated-tau (CP13) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in radiated (RAD) versus sham (SH) animals. Phosphorylated-tau and APP are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We determined if the expression levels of hyperphosphorylated-tau, 3R-tau, 4R-tau, synaptic, intraneuronal damage, and DNA damage/oncogenic activation markers were altered in RAD versus SH swine brains. Quantitative analyses demonstrated reduced levels of AT8 and 3R-tau in hippocampus (H) and striatum (Str), increased levels of synaptophysin and PSD-95 in frontal cortex (FCtx), and reduced levels of NF-L in cerebellum (CRB) of RAD versus SH swine. DNA damage and oncogene activation markers levels did not differ between RAD and SH animals, except for histone-H3 (increased in FCtx and CRB, decreased in Str), and p53 (reduced in FCtx, Str, H and CRB). These findings confirm the region-based effects of sLDR on proteins normally expressed in larger mammalian brains and support the potential applicability of LDR to beneficially interfere against neurodegenerative mechanisms.",Sci Rep,2023
38104173,Brain age prediction using combined deep convolutional neural network and multi-layer perceptron algorithms.,"The clinical applications of brain age prediction have expanded, particularly in anticipating the onset and prognosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we proposed a deep learning algorithm that leverages brain structural imaging data and enhances prediction accuracy by integrating biological sex information. Our model for brain age prediction, built on deep neural networks, employed a dataset of 3004 healthy subjects aged 18 and above. The T1-weighted images were minimally preprocessed and analyzed using the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The categorical sex information was then incorporated using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm. We trained and validated both a CNN-only algorithm (utilizing only brain structural imaging data), and a combined CNN-MLP algorithm (using both structural brain imaging data and sex information) for age prediction. By integrating sex information with T1-weighted imaging data, our proposed CNN-MLP algorithm outperformed not only the CNN-only algorithm but also established algorithms, such as brainageR, in prediction accuracy. Notably, this hybrid CNN-MLP algorithm effectively distinguished between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups by identifying variances in brain age gaps between them, highlighting the algorithm's potential for clinical application. Overall, these results underscore the enhanced precision of the CNN-MLP algorithm in brain age prediction, achieved through the integration of sex information.",Sci Rep,2023
36848419,"Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction in Normal Aging and Neurodegeneration: Mechanisms, Impact, and Treatments.","Cerebral endothelial cells and their linking tight junctions form a unique, dynamic and multi-functional interface, the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The endothelium is regulated by perivascular cells and components forming the neurovascular unit. This review examines BBB and neurovascular unit changes in normal aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly focusing on Alzheimer disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and vascular dementia. Increasing evidence indicates BBB dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration. Mechanisms underlying BBB dysfunction are outlined (endothelium and neurovascular unit mediated) as is the BBB as a therapeutic target including increasing the uptake of systemically delivered therapeutics across the BBB, enhancing clearance of potential neurotoxic compounds via the BBB, and preventing BBB dysfunction. Finally, a need for novel biomarkers of BBB dysfunction is addressed.",Stroke,2023
37891168,Chronic administration of XBD173 ameliorates cognitive deficits and neuropathology via 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). It affects cognition and leads to memory impairment. The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and has been implicated in several neuronal disorders or neuronal injuries. Ligands targeting the mitochondrial translocator protein (18 kDa), promote neurosteroidogenesis and may be neuroprotective. To study whether the TSPO ligand XBD173 may exert early neuroprotective effects in AD pathology we investigated the impact of XBD173 on amyloid toxicity and neuroplasticity in mouse models of AD. We show that XBD173 (emapunil), via neurosteroid-mediated signaling and delta subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, prevents the neurotoxic effect of Aβ on long-term potentiation (CA1-LTP) in the hippocampus and prevents the loss of spines. Chronic but not acute administration of XBD173 ameliorates spatial learning deficits in transgenic AD mice with arctic mutation (ArcAβ). The heterozygous TSPO-knockout crossed with the transgenic arctic mutation model of AD mice (het TSPOKO X ArcAβ) treated with XBD173 does not show this improvement in spatial learning suggesting TSPO is needed for procognitive effects of XBD173. The neuroprotective profile of XBD173 in AD pathology is further supported by a reduction in plaques and soluble Aβ levels in the cortex, increased synthesis of neurosteroids, rescued spine density, reduction of complement protein C1q deposits, and reduced astrocytic phagocytosis of functional synapses both in the hippocampus and cortex. Our findings suggest that XBD173 may exert therapeutic effects via TSPO in a mouse model of AD.",Transl Psychiatry,2023
39722190,Proteome profiling of cerebrospinal fluid using machine learning shows a unique protein signature associated with APOE4 genotype.,"Proteome changes associated with APOE4 variant carriage that are independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and diagnosis are unknown. This study investigated APOE4 proteome changes in people with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and no impairment. Clinical, APOE genotype, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and AD biomarker data was sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Proteome profiling was done using supervised machine learning. We found an APOE4-specific proteome signature that was independent of cognitive diagnosis and AD pathological biomarkers, and increased the risk of progression to cognitive impairment. Proteins were enriched in brain regions including the caudate and cortex and cells including endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Enriched peripheral immune cells included T cells, macrophages, and B cells. APOE4 carriers have a unique CSF proteome signature associated with a strong brain and peripheral immune and inflammatory phenotype that likely underlies APOE4 carriers' vulnerability to cognitive decline and AD as they age.",Aging Cell,2024
39711499,Alzheimer's Association's funding portfolio: Insights from the International Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Research Portfolio (IADRP).,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) present significant health challenges. Understanding their underlying biology, advancing existing and new therapies, and enhancing care for patients and caregivers are critical priorities.
METHODS: This article utilizes data from the International Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Research Portfolio (IADRP) to analyze funding patterns from the Alzheimer's Association over the past decade.
RESULTS: As the largest nonprofit funder of AD/ADRD research globally, the Alzheimer's Association has committed over $430 million, supporting a diverse range of studies across the entire spectrum of dementia-related science. The funding landscape has evolved, reflecting new areas of investigation and collaboration with broader research initiatives.
DISCUSSION: This article highlights the dynamic nature of the Association's funding strategies and ongoing efforts to connect funding with additional supportive resources, thereby enhancing the overall research ecosystem Highlights As the world's largest nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's disease and dementia science, the Alzheimer's Association's funding activities are strategically designed in partnership with the global research community to address scientific gaps in our knowledge to advance research. A large part of the Association's funding portfolio depends on key partnerships and collaborations.

39713882,Integrating rare pathogenic variant prioritization with gene-based association analysis to identify novel genes and relevant multimodal traits for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence has highlighted rare variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, insufficient sample sizes, especially in underrepresented ethnic groups, hinder their investigation. Additionally, their impact on endophenotypes remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: We prioritized rare likely-deleterious variants based on whole-genome sequencing data from a Chinese AD cohort (n = 988). Gene-based optimal sequence kernel association tests were conducted between AD cases and normal controls to identify AD-related genes. Network clustering, endophenotype association, and cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate their functional consequences.
RESULTS: We identified 11 novel AD candidate genes, which captured AD-related pathways and enhanced AD risk prediction performance. Key genes (RABEP1, VIPR1, RPL3L, and CABIN1) were linked to cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Experiments showed RABEP1 p.R845W inducing endocytosis dysregulation and exacerbating toxic amyloid β accumulation, underscoring its therapeutic potential.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the contributions of rare variants to AD and provided novel insights into AD therapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: Identified 11 novel AD candidate genes in a Chinese AD cohort. Correlated candidate genes with AD-related cognitive and brain imaging traits. Indicated RABEP1 p.R845W as a critical AD contributor in the endocytic pathway.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39559999,Neighborhood physical activity facilities predict risk of incident mixed and vascular dementia: The Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood environments may promote neurocognitive health in part by providing amenities that encourage physical activity. We examined associations between quantity of walkable facilities, including specifically physical activity facilities (e.g., gyms, recreation centers), with risk of incident dementia.
METHODS: Participants included 2923 adults ≥ 65 years old from the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study (1992-1999), with clinically adjudicated dementia classified over a median 6.0 years of follow-up. Walkable facilities were measured within 1 km (Euclidean) of home. Self-reported baseline physical activity was considered a moderator.
RESULTS: In adjusted Cox models, participants with ≥ 2 (vs. 0) physical activity facilities had reduced risk of mixed/vascular dementia, but not Alzheimer's disease, particularly after excluding individuals in the bottom 20th percentile of physical activity (hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.89).
DISCUSSION: Neighborhood amenities that encourage physical activity may mitigate dementia risk via improved vascular health, especially for individuals with sufficient baseline mobility to use these resources.
HIGHLIGHTS: We examined associations between nearby walkable facilities and incident dementia. Facilities within 1 km were counted via the National Establishment Time Series Database. More physical activity facilities predicted lower risk of mixed/vascular dementia. No associations were found between walkable facilities and incident Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39737627,Microstructural mapping of neural pathways in Alzheimer's disease using macrostructure-informed normative tractometry.,"INTRODUCTION: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is sensitive to the microstructural properties of brain tissues and shows great promise in detecting the effects of degenerative diseases. However, many approaches analyze single measures averaged over regions of interest without considering the underlying fiber geometry.
METHODS: We propose a novel macrostructure-informed normative tractometry (MINT) framework to investigate how white matter (WM) microstructure and macrostructure are jointly altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We compared MINT-derived metrics with univariate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to examine how fiber geometry may impact the interpretation of microstructure.
RESULTS: In two multisite cohorts from North America and India, we find consistent patterns of microstructural and macrostructural anomalies implicated in MCI and dementia; we also rank diffusion metrics' sensitivity to dementia.
DISCUSSION: We show that MINT, by jointly modeling tract shape and microstructure, has the potential to disentangle and better interpret the effects of degenerative disease on the brain's neural pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics may be due to macroscopic changes. Normative models encode normal variability of diffusion metrics in healthy controls. Variational autoencoder applied on tractography can learn patterns of fiber geometry. WM microstructure and macrostructure are modeled with multivariate methods. Transfer learning uses pretraining and fine-tuning for increased efficiency.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39737731,Resilience to Alzheimer's disease associates with alterations in perineuronal nets.,"INTRODUCTION: Some individuals show intact cognition despite the presence of neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The plasticity of parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons might contribute to resilience. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), that is, extracellular matrix structures around neurons, modulate PV neuron function. We hypothesize that PNNs play a role in resilience to AD.
METHODS: PNN amount and morphology were determined in immunolabelled sections of the frontal cortex of control, AD and resilient subjects. Expression levels of genes related to PNNs and microglia signatures were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The expression of the PNN-component aggrecan around PV neurons is decreased in resilient and AD subjects, whereas PNN-sugar chains are reduced only in resilient subjects. In AD, fewer presynaptic terminals on PV neurons are detected and genes related to PNN degradation are upregulated.
DISCUSSION: These data show distinct PNN changes in individuals resilient to AD, which may contribute to preserved cognition despite the neuropathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Aggrecan levels are decreased in the frontal cortex of AD and resilient subjects. In resilient subjects, WFA+ PNNs are reduced around neuronal somata. In AD patients, PV neurons show disrupted WFA peridendritic staining and synaptic loss. Expression levels of PNN-degrading enzymes are higher in AD. Excitatory neurons bearing a PNN show low amounts of ptau.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39732521,Choroid plexus cysts on 7T MRI: Relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: The choroid plexus (CP) may play a crucial role in brain degeneration. We aim to assess whether CP cysts (CPCs), defined using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relate to aging and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We used multi-sequence 7T MRI to observe CPCs, characterizing their presence and characteristics in healthy younger controls, healthy older controls (OCs), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and patients with uremic encephalopathy. CP volume (CPV) and CPC characteristics were compared across groups, and associations between CPV and CPC features were analyzed across all subjects.
RESULTS: The AD group showed a significantly higher presence and number of CPCs compared to other groups and also had a significantly larger CPV than healthy OCs. The number and size of CPCs were associated with CPV.
DISCUSSION: 7T MRI offers a distinct advantage in observing CPCs, and the high prevalence of CPCs in patients with AD warrants further investigation.
HIGHLIGHTS: 7T MRI enables visualization of the fine structures of the choroid plexus. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a higher number of choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) compared to healthy older adults and other patient groups. CPCs may serve as an auxiliary marker for AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39588869,Communication Bridge-2 randomized controlled trial: Recruitment and baseline features.,"INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological interventions may offer significant benefits to the quality of life for persons with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and their care partners but have lacked efficacy trials. To help fill the efficacy gap, we provide the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment, randomization, and baseline data for the Communication Bridge-2 (CB2) randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: CB2 is the first international, single enrollment site, Phase 2, Stage 2, parallel-group, active control, RCT delivered via video chat to individuals with PPA and their care partners. Participants were recruited, screened, and randomized into one of two speech-language intervention arms.
RESULTS: Ninety-five participant dyads (PPA mean baseline age: 67.1; 48% female) from four countries were enrolled and randomized.
DISCUSSION: Global recruitment, enrollment, and randomization of individuals with PPA into a video chat-delivered non-pharmacologic RCT is feasible. This trial provides a potential model for conducting rigorous non-pharmacologic efficacy trials for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
HIGHLIGHTS: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) negatively impacts communication participation. Communication Bridge-2 (CB2) is a telemedicine-delivered randomized controlled trial. CB2 included global recruitment and randomization of 95 PPA participant dyads. CB2, the first international superiority trial for PPA using video chat shows feasibility.

39575672,APOE ε4-associated heterogeneity of neuroimaging biomarkers across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"INTRODUCTION: While the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility has been studied extensively, much less is known about the differences in disease presentation in APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers.
METHODS: To help elucidate these differences, we performed a broad analysis comparing the regional levels of six different neuroimaging biomarkers in the brains of APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers who participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
RESULTS: We observed significant APOE ε4-associated heterogeneity in regional amyloid beta deposition, tau accumulation, glucose uptake, brain volume, cerebral blood flow, and white matter hyperintensities within each AD diagnostic group. We also observed important APOE ε4-associated differences in cognitively unimpaired individuals who converted to mild cognitive impairment/AD versus those who did not convert.
DISCUSSION: This observed heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers between APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers may have important implications regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD in different subpopulations.
HIGHLIGHTS: An extensive study was performed on the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4-associated heterogeneity in neuroimaging biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Robust APOE ε4-associated increases in amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition throughout the brain, in every diagnostic group, were observed. APOE ε4-associated increases in tau pathology, decreases in glucose uptake, and increases in brain atrophy, which expand in regional scope and magnitude with disease progression, were observed. Significant sex- and age-related differences in APOE ε4-associated neuroimaging biomarker heterogeneity, with overall increases in pathological presentation in female APOE ε4 carriers, were observed. Regional differences in Aβ deposition, tau accumulation, glucose uptake, ventricle size, and white matter hyperintensities were observed in cognitively normal participants who converted to mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease, which may hold potential predictive value.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39558898,Plasma p-tau181 and GFAP reflect 7T MR-derived changes in Alzheimer's disease: A longitudinal study of structural and functional MRI and MRS.,"BACKGROUND: Associations between longitudinal changes of plasma biomarkers and cerebral magnetic resonance (MR)-derived measurements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear.
METHODS: In a study population (n = 127) of healthy older adults and patients within the AD continuum, we examined associations between longitudinal plasma amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and 7T structural and functional MR imaging and spectroscopy using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Increases in both p-tau181 and GFAP showed the strongest associations to 7T MR-derived measurements, particularly with decreasing parietal cortical thickness, decreasing connectivity of the salience network, and increasing neuroinflammation as determined by MR spectroscopy (MRS) myo-inositol.
DISCUSSION: Both plasma p-tau181 and GFAP appear to reflect disease progression, as indicated by 7T MR-derived brain changes which are not limited to areas known to be affected by tau pathology and neuroinflammation measured by MRS myo-inositol, respectively.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study leverages high-resolution 7T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRS) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarker insights. Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed the largest changes over time, particularly in the AD group. p-tau181 and GFAP are robust in reflecting 7T MR-based changes in AD. The strongest associations were for frontal/parietal MR changes and MRS neuroinflammation.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39732514,Cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories of subjective cognitive decline according to baseline biomarkers: Results of the CoSCo study.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now diagnosed biologically. Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may indicate preclinical AD, assessing AD-biomarkers is crucial. We investigated cognitive and neurodegenerative trajectories in SCD over 24 months based on biomarker positivity, and evaluated the predictive value of plasma biomarkers.
METHODS: The CoSCo prospective cohort included older adults with SCD. Participants were categorized into high- and low-risk groups based on plasma biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ] 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to compare outcomes.
RESULTS: High-risk SCDs (n = 23, 23%) revealed greater decline in general cognition, memory recall, frontal function, and hippocampal volumes compared to low-risk SCDs. Combined scores of plasma and MRIs yielded the best predictions compared with other biomarker categories.
DISCUSSION: SCD participants with high-risk experience faster cognitive and neurodegenerative declines. A combination of plasma biomarkers and MRIs could be used for screening and prognosis.
HIGHLIGHTS: This is part of a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea. We investigated cognitive and atrophic trajectories in SCD over 24 months. High risk SCDs revealed greater cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. Integration of plasma and MRIs yielded better predictions than other categories. Risk stratification using plasma and MRIs can be used for screening and prognosis.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39559917,Counseling and disclosure practices in predictive Alzheimer's disease diagnostics: A scoping review.,"New possibilities of biomarker-based predictive technologies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become more reliable as well as more accessible. Standardized clinical recommendations and guidance for counseling and disclosure in this context are not yet well developed. Our scoping review identified publications from database searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, LIVIVO, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were: (1) information or counseling, (2) biomarkers and a type of cognitive impairment or AD, and (3) published between 2005 and 2024. We identified 63 articles and synthesized them along the categories of staged information provision: pre-test counseling, disclosure, and post-disclosure follow-up. Most publications referred to the context of disclosure (48), followed by pre-test counseling (33), and post-disclosure follow-up (31). Some publications referred to all stages of counseling (17). Our findings highlight the need to further develop and specify comprehensive and standardized guidelines for counseling, disclosure, and post-disclosure follow-up in the context of AD biomarker testing. HIGHLIGHTS: New possibilities of biomarker-based predictive technologies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become more reliable and also more accessible. However, clinical recommendations and guidance for counseling and disclosure in the context of AD biomarker testing are currently not well developed. We carried out a scoping review with the aim to generate an overview of the scientific literature and guidance available regarding counseling, biomarker test result and dementia risk disclosure, and clinical management prior to and in the course of a biomarker-based diagnosis in early stages of AD. We identified 63 relevant articles. Most publications referred to the context of disclosure (48), followed by pre-test counseling (33), and post-disclosure follow-up (31). Some publications referred to all stages of counseling (17). Our findings highlight the urgent need for national and international consensus guidelines for comprehensive and staged counseling and disclosure practices. While most publications identify relevant ethical challenges posed for counseling practices in the context of AD biomarker testing, they rarely present any practical recommendations for clinicians, on how and what to counsel on a concrete level.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39740074,Clinical use of biomarkers in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatments.,"With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well-validated biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of test results may be complex and depends on the pre-test probability and test-specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non-dementia specialists to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.",Alzheimers Dement,2024

39711285,Premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy and Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers later in life.,"INTRODUCTION: Premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) before the age of 46 years is associated with an increased risk of dementia. We investigated the long-term effects of PBO performed before age 50 years on amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and neurodegeneration imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging-2 participants were divided into early PBO (< 46 years; n = 61), and late PBO (46-49 years; n = 51) groups and were compared to referent women who did not undergo PBO (n = 119).
RESULTS: Early PBO was associated with thinner entorhinal cortex (p = 0.014), higher tau load at higher levels of Aβ load (Pp = 0.005), higher Aβ load (p = 0.026), and smaller temporal lobe cortical thickness (p = 0.022), only at older ages compared to the referent group.
DISCUSSION: PBO before the age of 46 years is associated with entorhinal cortex thinning, elevated tau at higher Aβ levels, along with an AD-like pattern of atrophy at older ages.

39535517,Blood biomarkers in Down syndrome: Facilitating Alzheimer's disease detection and monitoring.,"Blood-based biomarkers continue to be explored for disease detection, monitoring of progression, and therapeutic outcomes as the diagnostic determination of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome (DS-AD) remains challenging in clinical settings. This perspective highlights the current status of this effort. Overall, amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) blood-based biomarkers have been shown to increase with disease pathology for individuals with DS. Phosphorylated tau biomarkers (p-tau217, p-tau181) have been consistently shown to track disease progression for DS-AD and are likely good candidates for use in clinical settings. Biomarkers of inflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein) also show promise; however, additional work is needed. Findings from stability work of blood-based biomarkers conducted among non-DS also support the potential longitudinal utility of biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain and p-tau181 in DS. Gaps in our knowledge are highlighted, and a potential role for sex differences in biomarker outcomes is noted, along with recommendations for determining the appropriate context of use when translating biomarkers into clinical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: An overview of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided for consideration of their utility among individuals with Down syndrome when looking toward potential clinical applications. Longitudinal stability of many blood biomarkers and improvement in detection sensitivity make blood such as plasma a viable source for exploring AD pathology.

39575871,Benchmarking of a multi-biomarker low-volume panel for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research.,"INTRODUCTION: In the research setting, obtaining accurate established biomarker measurements and maximizing use of the precious samples is key. Accurate technologies are available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but no platform can measure all the established and emerging biomarkers in one run. The NUcleic acid Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) is a technology that requires 15 µL of sample to measure more than 100 analytes.
METHODS: We compared AD-relevant biomarkers included in the NULISA against validated assays in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma.
RESULTS: CSF measures of amyloid beta 42/40, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 are highly correlated when measured by immunoassay, mass spectrometry, or NULISA. In plasma, p-tau217 performance is similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis. Other biomarkers show a wide range of correlation values depending on the fluid and the platform.
DISCUSSION: The NULISA multiplexed platform produces reliable results for established biomarkers in CSF that are useful in research settings, with the advantage of measuring additional biomarkers using minimal sample volume.

METHODS: We compared demographic characteristics, health factors, and cognitive and functional assessments across three time points: the first NC visit, the last NC visit, and the first AD dementia visit.
RESULTS: The NC-MCI-AD group showed greater impairment in cognitive and functional scores at AD dementia diagnosis, despite maintaining better cognitive function during the NC stage. Analysis of yearly changes revealed negligible differences during NC. However, the yearly change during the AD dementia stage suggested potentially more rapid functional decline in the NC-AD group.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the heterogeneity in AD disease progression and emphasize the importance of considering diverse progression patterns in AD research and clinical practice.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated the disease progression difference between patients who converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from normal cognition (NC) directly or through the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. We found that the NC-MCI-AD group showed greater impairment in cognitive and functional scores at AD dementia diagnosis. We discovered that the NC-AD group had rapid functional decline once patients were confirmed with AD onset.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39711331,Factors associated with care-resistant behavior in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set.,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the factors associated with care-resistant behavior in community-dwelling persons living with dementia.
METHODS: Regression modeling was performed on 41,143 responses to a standardized questionnaire from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set.
RESULTS: In the fully adjusted mixed-effects regression model, collinearity was low, with no variance inflation factor above 1.15. Moderate (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50, 1.69) and severe (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.82, 2.09) dementia severity; and Black (aOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.47, 1.82), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), frontotemporal (aOR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.49) and Lewy body dementia (aOR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.29) diagnosis type were associated with a higher odds of care-resistant behavior. Female sex (aOR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91) and higher education (aOR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.97) were associated with lower odds of care-resistant behavior.
DISCUSSION: Interventions to manage care-resistant behaviors should consider sociocultural factors as well as type of dementia diagnosis to limit caregiver strain and burden.
HIGHLIGHTS: Frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Black race were associated with a higher likelihood of exhibiting care-resistant behavior. Female sex and higher educational attainment were associated with a lower likelihood of exhibiting care-resistant behavior. Differences in specific presentations of care-resistant behaviors are less understood.",Alzheimers Dement,2024

39513754,Pharmacodynamic effects of semorinemab on plasma and CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.,"INTRODUCTION: Semorinemab, an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, was assessed in two Phase II trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers provided insights into the drug's potential mechanism of action.
METHODS: Qualified assays were used to measure biomarkers of tau, amyloidosis, glial activity, neuroinflammation, synaptic function, and neurodegeneration from participant samples in Tauriel (NCT03289143) and Lauriet (NCT03828747) Phase II trials.
RESULTS: Plasma phosphorylated Tau 181 (pTau181) and CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) increased following semorinemab treatment in both studies. In Lauriet, increasing plasma glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) concentrations stabilized with semorinemab, while this was not observed in Tauriel. Other AD pathophysiology biomarkers showed no consistent response to semorinemab.
DISCUSSION: Increases in CSF YKL-40 suggest that semorinemab may stimulate microglia activation in the presence of AD-associated Tau pathology, but not in healthy controls. Stabilization of plasma GFAP in Lauriet indicates a possible impact on reactive gliosis in mild-to-moderate AD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Tauriel ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03289143. Lauriet ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03828747. Phase 1 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02820896.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD pathophysiology biomarkers were measured to assess the mechanism of action. Semorinemab increased CSF YKL-40 in participants with AD but not in healthy controls. Semorinemab possibly stabilized plasma GFAP in the Lauriet trial. Semorinemab treatment may activate microglia and moderate reactive gliosis.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39641382,Association of ten VEGF family genes with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes at single cell resolution.,"INTRODUCTION: Using a single-nucleus transcriptome derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 424 Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) participants, we investigated the cell type-specific effect of ten vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes on Alzheimer's disease (AD) endophenotypes.
METHODS: Negative binomial mixed models were used for differential gene expression and association analysis with AD endophenotypes. VEGF-associated intercellular communication was also profiled.
RESULTS: Higher microglia FLT1, endothelial FLT4, and oligodendrocyte VEGFB are associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) load, whereas higher VEGFB expression in inhibitory neurons is associated with lower Aβ load. Higher astrocyte NRP1 is associated with lower tau density. Higher microglia and endothelial FLT1 are associated with worse cognition performance. Endothelial and microglial FLT1 expression was upregulated in clinical AD patients compared to cognitively normal controls. Finally, AD cells showed a significant reduction in VEGF signaling compared to controls.
DISCUSSION: Our results highlight key changes in VEGF receptor expression in endothelial and microglial cells during AD, and the potential protective role of VEGFB in neurons.
HIGHLIGHTS: The prefrontal cortical expression of FLT1 and FLT4 was associated with worse cross-sectional global cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive trajectories, and more Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The associations between FLT1 or FLT4 and AD endophenotypes appear to be driven by endothelial and microglial cells. VEGFB expression seems to have opposing effects on the Aβ burden in AD depending on cell types, highlighting its potential protective role in neurons.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39641397,Clinical value of novel blood-based tau biomarkers in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnostic and prognostic performance of the novel fluid biomarkers brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is not defined.
METHODS: We measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma BD-tau, p-tau217, p-tau181, total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), and 14-3-3 in 100 CJD patients, 100 with non-prion rapidly progressive dementia (np-RPD), 92 with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI), and 55 healthy controls (HC).
RESULTS: Plasma BD-tau performed comparably to plasma t-tau but had lower performance than CSF t-tau (p < 0.001) and 14-3-3 (p = 0.014) in CJD versus np-RPD differential diagnosis. Plasma BD-tau diagnostic accuracy increased when ratioed to plasma p-tau217, matching CSF 14-3-3. Plasma BD-tau levels were associated with survival (p < 0.001), outperforming t-tau and NfL.
DISCUSSION: Plasma BD-tau is a valuable marker for CJD prognostication. In the clinical setting, the plasma BD-tau/p-tau217 ratio provides an accurate, fast marker supporting the clinical diagnosis of CJD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The increase of plasma BD-tau levels parallels that of CSF t-tau in CJD. CSF p-tau217 levels are significantly increased in CJD, reflecting a prion-specific secondary tauopathy. Plasma p-tau217 shows a distinct profile than CSF p-tau217 in CJD. Plasma BD-tau/p-tau217 ratio is as accurate as CSF 14-3-3 in distinguishing CJD from np-RPDs, including AD. BD-tau represents a valuable blood-based biomarker for CJD prognostication.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39711133,"Lewy body co-pathology in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy contributes to differential neuropathological, cognitive, and brain atrophy patterns.","INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathology with Lewy bodies (LB) is frequent and influences clinical manifestations and outcomes. Its significance in primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is unknown. We investigated the influence of LB on cognition and brain atrophy in AD and PART.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in a large sample of autopsied participants with AD neuropathological change (ADNC) with and without LB and PART with and without LB, with corresponding ante mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset.
RESULTS: LB co-pathology worsened cognitive impairment in both PART and ADNC. On longitudinal follow-up, LB impacted cognitive decline in multiple domains. Additionally, LB influenced brain atrophy on MRI across groups and LB regional staging was different in PART and ADNC, accompanying tauopathy progression.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that LB co-pathology is associated with divergent patterns of cognitive impairment, brain atrophy, and regional pathological distribution in PART and AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lewy body (LB) co-pathology is frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with important clinical implications. LB co-pathology is also present in primary age-related tauopathy (PART), but its significance is still understudied. In PART and AD, LB leads to higher cognitive impairment and brain regional atrophy. In PART and AD, LB tends to accompany neurofibrillary tangle progression, suggesting amyloid pathology might be a trigger for regional pathology progression.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39537356,Additive effects of cerebrovascular disease functional connectome phenotype and plasma p-tau181 on longitudinal neurodegeneration and cognitive outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effects of multiple cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) neuroimaging markers on brain functional connectivity (FC), and how such CeVD-related FC changes interact with plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 (an Alzheimer's disease [AD] marker) to influence downstream neurodegeneration and cognitive changes.
METHODS: Multivariate associations among four CeVD markers and whole-brain FC in 529 participants across the dementia spectrum were examined using partial least squares correlation. Interactive effects of CeVD-related FC patterns and p-tau181 on longitudinal gray matter volume (GMV) and cognitive changes were investigated using linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: We identified a brain FC phenotype associated with high CeVD burden across all markers. Further, expression of this general CeVD-related FC phenotype and p-tau181 contributed additively, but not synergistically, to baseline and longitudinal GMV and cognitive changes.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that CeVD exerts global effects on the brain connectome and highlight the additive nature of AD and CeVD on neurodegeneration and cognition.
HIGHLIGHTS: Effects of multiple cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) markers on functional connectivity were studied. A global network phenotype linked to high burden across CeVD markers was identified. CeVD phenotype and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 contributed additively to downstream outcomes.",Alzheimers Dement,2024
39748849,Plasma amyloid beta biomarkers predict amyloid positivity and longitudinal clinical progression in mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have examined the predictive accuracy of plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers in clinical cohorts. However, their accuracy for predicting amyloid-positive patients in community-based cohorts is unclear. This study aimed to determine the predictive accuracy of Aβ precursor protein 669-711/Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40/1-42 and their composite biomarkers for brain amyloid deposition or the clinical progression in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted from August 2015 to September 2019. Subsequently, the participants underwent follow-up cognitive assessments up to 8 years after the start of the study. Blood samples were collected from older adults aged ≥ 65 years with MCI at baseline. Plasma Aβ biomarkers were analyzed using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. The accuracy of plasma biomarkers for brain amyloid status was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Relationships between comorbidities and plasma Aβ markers were examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Associations of plasma biomarkers with clinical conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were evaluated using Kaplan‒Meier curves.
RESULTS: The participants included 107 patients (57 [53.3%] females, median age: 76.0 [72.0-80.0] years). Plasma biomarkers correlated with cortical amyloid uptake (ρ = 0.667-0.754). The composite biomarker had the best area under the curve (0.943, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.901 to 0.985) for predicting amyloid positivity. Apolipoprotein ε4 status showed significant correlations with increased plasma amyloid biomarker levels. Participants with high composite biomarker levels at baseline had a greater risk of conversion to AD dementia (hazard ratio 10.74, 95% CI: 3.51 to 32.84, P &lt; 0.001). The higher composite biomarker was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline (ρ = -0.575, P &lt; 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Plasma Aβ composite biomarker may serve as a surrogate measure for amyloid deposition and a predictor of disease progression in a community-based cohort.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers correlated with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B uptake, mainly in the frontal/parietotemporal cortices and posterior cingulate gyrus.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict amyloid positron emission tomography positivity with a high area under the curve of 0.943 in a community-based mild cognitive impairment cohort.The higher amyloid composite biomarker at baseline was significantly associated with worsening Mini-Mental State Examination score and a high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia over 8 years.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict clinical progression to AD dementia with a high area under the curve of 0.860.Apolipoprotein E ε4 status influenced the plasma Aβ biomarker levels.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39716328,Anti-diabetic agents and the risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between anti-diabetic agents and the risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrial.gov between January 1995 and October 2024. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with T2D, which intercompared anti-diabetic agents or compared them with placebo, and reported the incidence of dementia were included. Conventional and network meta-analyses of these studies were implemented. Results were exhibited as the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 41 observational studies (3,307,483 participants) and 23 RCTs (155,443 participants) were included. In the network meta-analysis of observational studies, compared with non-users, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) (OR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.45 to 0.69), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) (OR = 0.58, 95%CI, 0.46 to 0.73), thiazolidinedione (TZD) (OR = 0.68, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.81) and metformin (OR = 0.89, 95%CI, 0.80 to 0.99) treatments were all associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) evaluation conferred a rank order as SGLT-2i > GLP-1RA > TZD > dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) > metformin > α-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) > glucokinase activator (GKA) > sulfonylureas > glinides > insulin in terms of the cognitive benefits. Meanwhile, compared with non-users, SGLT-2i (OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.62), GLP-1RA (OR = 0.54, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.96) and DPP-4i (OR = 0.73, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.93) were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease while a lower risk of vascular dementia was observed in patients receiving SGLT-2i (OR = 0.42, 95%CI, 0.22 to 0.80) and TZD (OR = 0.52, 95%CI, 0.36 to 0.75) treatment. In the network meta-analysis of RCTs, the risks of dementia were comparable among anti-diabetic agents and placebo.
CONCLUSION: Compared with non-users, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA, TZD and metformin were associated with the reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. SGLT-2i, and GLP-1RA may serve as the optimal choice to improve the cognitive prognosis in patients with T2D.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39079537,Omnibus proteome-wide association study identifies 43 risk genes for Alzheimer disease dementia.,"Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) tools have been applied to conduct proteome-wide association studies (PWASs) by integrating proteomics data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data. The genetic effects of PWAS-identified significant genes are potentially mediated through genetically regulated protein abundance, thus informing the underlying disease mechanisms better than GWAS loci. However, existing TWAS/PWAS tools are limited by considering only one statistical model. We propose an omnibus PWAS pipeline to account for multiple statistical models and demonstrate improved performance by simulation and application studies of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. We employ the Aggregated Cauchy Association Test to derive omnibus PWAS (PWAS-O) p values from PWAS p values obtained by three existing tools assuming complementary statistical models-TIGAR, PrediXcan, and FUSION. Our simulation studies demonstrated improved power, with well-calibrated type I error, for PWAS-O over all three individual tools. We applied PWAS-O to studying AD dementia with reference proteomic data profiled from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of postmortem brains from individuals of European ancestry. We identified 43 risk genes, including 5 not identified by previous studies, which are interconnected through a protein-protein interaction network that includes the well-known AD risk genes TOMM40, APOC1, and APOC2. We also validated causal genetic effects mediated through the proteome for 27 (63%) PWAS-O risk genes, providing insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of AD dementia and highlighting promising targets for therapeutic development. PWAS-O can be easily applied to studying other complex diseases.",Am J Hum Genet,2024
39692449,MORE: a multi-omics data-driven hypergraph integration network for biomedical data classification and biomarker identification.,"High-throughput sequencing methods have brought about a huge change in omics-based biomedical study. Integrating various omics data is possibly useful for identifying some correlations across data modalities, thus improving our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and complexity. Nevertheless, most existing graph-based feature extraction methods overlook the complementary information and correlations across modalities. Moreover, these methods tend to treat the features of each omics modality equally, which contradicts current biological principles. To solve these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for integrating multi-omics data termed Multi-Omics hypeRgraph integration nEtwork (MORE). MORE initially constructs a comprehensive hyperedge group by extensively investigating the informative correlations within and across modalities. Subsequently, the multi-omics hypergraph encoding module is employed to learn the enriched omics-specific information. Afterward, the multi-omics self-attention mechanism is then utilized to adaptatively aggregate valuable correlations across modalities for representation learning and making the final prediction. We assess MORE's performance on datasets characterized by message RNA (mRNA) expression, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) methylation, and microRNA (miRNA) expression for Alzheimer's disease, invasive breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma. The results from three classification tasks highlight the competitive advantage of MORE in contrast with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, the results also show that MORE has the capability to identify a greater variety of disease-related biomarkers compared to existing methods, highlighting its advantages in biomedical data mining and interpretation. Overall, MORE can be investigated as a valuable tool for facilitating multi-omics analysis and novel biomarker discovery.

39516239,Helicobacter pylori outer membrane vesicles directly promote Aβ aggregation and enhance Aβ toxicity in APP/PS1 mice.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been found associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with unclear mechanisms. Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) are spherical particles secreted by Gram-negative bacteria. Here we explore the effect of H. pylori OMVs on Aβ aggregation and toxicity. We show intraperitoneally-injected H. pylori OMVs enter the brain and co-localize with Aβ plaques in APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by aggravated Aβ pathology, exacerbated cognitive deficits and synaptic impairment, indicating that H. pylori OMVs promote β-amyloidosis and AD development. The in vitro results further identify that H. pylori OMVs significantly accelerate Aβ aggregation and increase Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Through lipidomic analysis, we reveal that lipid components, particularly LPC 18:0 in H. pylori OMVs accelerate Aβ aggregation and enhance Aβ neurotoxicity. Moreover, H. pylori OMVs-enhanced Aβ neurotoxicity is mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These findings reveal a mechanism of H. pylori OMVs in accelerating AD development in which the bacterial OMVs-originated lipid components play a key role in promoting Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity.",Commun Biol,2024
39251807,Genome-wide association study meta-analysis of neurofilament light (NfL) levels in blood reveals novel loci related to neurodegeneration.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in circulation have been established as a sensitive biomarker of neuro-axonal damage across a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Elucidation of the genetic architecture of blood NfL levels could provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. In this meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of blood NfL levels from eleven cohorts of European ancestry, we identify two genome-wide significant loci at 16p12 (UMOD) and 17q24 (SLC39A11). We observe association of three loci at 1q43 (FMN2), 12q14, and 12q21 with blood NfL levels in the meta-analysis of African-American ancestry. In the trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we identify three additional genome-wide significant loci at 1p32 (FGGY), 6q14 (TBX18), and 4q21. In the post-GWAS analyses, we observe the association of higher NfL polygenic risk score with increased plasma levels of total-tau, Aβ-40, Aβ-42, and higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the Rotterdam Study. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest that a lower kidney function could cause higher blood NfL levels. This study uncovers multiple genetic loci of blood NfL levels, highlighting the genes related to molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration.",Commun Biol,2024
39420210,Identification of tauopathy-associated lipid signatures in Alzheimer's disease mouse brain using label-free chemical imaging.,"There is cumulative evidence that lipid metabolism plays a key role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visualising lipid content in a non-destructive label-free manner can aid in elucidating the AD phenotypes towards a better understanding of the disease. In this study, we combined multiple optical molecular-specific methods, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging, synchrotron radiation-infrared (SR-IR) microscopy, Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, and optical-photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) microscopy with multivariate data analysis, to investigate the biochemistry of brain hippocampus in situ using a mouse model of tauopathy (rTg4510). We observed a significant difference in the morphology and lipid content between transgenic (TG) and wild type (WT) samples. Immunohistochemical staining revealed some degree of microglia co-localisation with elevated lipids in the brain. These results provide new evidence of tauopathy-related dysfunction in a preclinical study at a subcellular level.",Commun Biol,2024
39688956,Statistical examination of shared loci in neuropsychiatric diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics.,"Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant 'local' genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter.",Elife,2024
39027984,Alzheimer's disease linked Aβ42 exerts product feedback inhibition on γ-secretase impairing downstream cell signaling.,"Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of γ-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Aβ, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Aβ on γ-secretases. We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17-42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.",Elife,2024
39392298,Systematic evaluation of multifactorial causal associations for Alzheimer's disease and an interactive platform MRAD developed based on Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex degenerative disease of the central nervous system, and elucidating its pathogenesis remains challenging. In this study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD (https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance our understanding of the etiology of AD.",Elife,2024

Here, we develop an RNA-cleaving tool, TaqTth-hpRNA, consisting of a small, chimeric TaqTth, and a hairpin RNA guiding probe. With a minimal flanking sequence-motif requirement, in vitro and in vivo studies show TaqTth-hpRNA cleaves RNA efficiently and specifically. In an Alzheimer's disease model, we demonstrate silencing of mutant APP<sup>swe</sup> mRNA without altering the wild-type APP mRNA. Notably, due to the compact size of TaqTth, we are able to combine with APOE2 overexpression in a single AAV vector, which results in stronger inhibition of pathologies.",Genome Biol,2024
39686610,Factors influencing rates of unsupervised assessment of short-term learning in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"BACKGROUND: In older adults with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), learning curves derived from validated psychological learning paradigms are reduced to an extent greater than impairment, or decline, on neuropsychological memory tests.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine how age, sex, education, mood, and general dementia risk, which also increases risk for preclinical AD, could influence learning curves.
METHODS: 1050 adults enrolled in the BetterBrains trial completed 10 blocks of ORCA-LLT learning trials over 5 days. Learning curves were derived from improvement in accuracy over trials. Participants also completed questionnaires of demography and mood, and the CAIDE risk score was computed for each participant.
RESULTS: Most participants (67%) completed ≥6 blocks of ORCA-LLT. Older age (d = 0.75), lower education (d = 0.50), and higher dementia risk (d = 0.36) were associated significantly with slower learning rates.
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, learning curves are influenced subtly by age, education, and dementia risk but not by sex or mood.",J Alzheimers Dis,2024
39686621,"Conformation pattern changes in R1-pS262 tau peptide induced endogenous tau aggregation, synaptic damage, and cognitive impairments.","BACKGROUND: To date, the effect of tau phosphorylation at different amino acid sites on the conformation and function of tau is still unclear in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Protein fingerprinting, also known as the protein folding shape code (PFSC) method, is a protein structure prediction technique based on protein sequence, which can reveal proteins' most likely spatial conformation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of phosphorylation on tau protein conformation using PFSC technology and further analyze the differences in the effect of phosphorylation on tau aggregation at specific sites.
METHODS: We performed a conformational analysis of wild-type and simulated mutant hTau441 using the PFSC method and synthesized the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau fragments by the chemical solid phase method.
RESULTS: We found that the number of Ser262 protein fingerprints increased from six in tau S262A to nine in tau S262E, together with increased conformational changes and enhanced flexibility. The in vitro Thioflavin S assay showed that phosphorylated tau fragments R1-pS262 possessed a stronger activity of inducing tau aggregation. In contrast to the non-phosphorylated tau fragment R1-nS262, R1-pS262 promoted endogenous tau aggregation and decreased synaptic proteins. In rats, R1-pS262 caused cognitive impairments and neuronal loss in addition to endogenous tau aggregation and synaptic damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study firstly reports that tau phosphorylation at Ser262 induces tau aggregation, and phosphorylated tau fragments R1-pS262 directly result in neuropathological changes. These provide new clues to the pathogenesis of tauopathy, such as AD, and a new molecular target for possible intervention.",J Alzheimers Dis,2024
39702989,Multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers and subtle cognitive decline in a population-based cohort without dementia.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between subtle cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as measured by biomarkers in settings outside of specialty memory clinics is not well characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate how subtle longitudinal cognitive decline relates to neuroimaging biomarkers in individuals drawn from a population-based study in an economically depressed, small-town area in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA.
METHODS: A subset of participants without dementia (N = 115, age 76.53 years ± 6.25) from the Monongahela Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) study completed neuroimaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-signature region cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451-PET for tau deposition. Neuropsychological evaluations were completed at multiple timepoints up to 11 years prior to neuroimaging. Aβ positivity was determined using a regional approach. We used linear mixed models to examine neuroimaging biomarker associations with retrospective cognitive slopes in five domains and a global cognitive composite.
RESULTS: Among Aβ(+) participants (38%), there were associations between (i) tau Braak III/IV and language decline (p < 0.05), (ii) cortical thickness and both memory decline (p < 0.001) and global cognitive decline (p < 0.01), and (iii) WMH and decline in executive function (p < 0.05) and global cognition (p < 0.05). Among Aβ(-) participants, there was an association between tau Braak III/IV and decline on tests of attention/psychomotor speed (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm an Aβ-dependent early AD biomarker pathway, and suggest a possible Aβ-independent, non-AD process underlying subtle cognitive decline in a population-based sample of older adults without dementia.",J Alzheimers Dis,2024
38173654,Attention-gated 3D CapsNet for robust hippocampal segmentation.,"PURPOSE: The hippocampus is organized in subfields (HSF) involved in learning and memory processes and widely implicated in pathologies at different ages of life, from neonatal hypoxia to temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. Getting a highly accurate and robust delineation of sub-millimetric regions such as HSF to investigate anatomo-functional hypotheses is a challenge. One of the main difficulties encountered by those methodologies is related to the small size and anatomical variability of HSF, resulting in the scarcity of manual data labeling. Recently introduced, capsule networks solve analogous problems in medical imaging, providing deep learning architectures with rotational equivariance. Nonetheless, capsule networks are still two-dimensional and unassessed for the segmentation of HSF.
APPROACH: We released a public 3D Capsule Network (3D-AGSCaps, https://github.com/clementpoiret/3D-AGSCaps) and compared it to equivalent architectures using classical convolutions on the automatic segmentation of HSF on small and atypical datasets (incomplete hippocampal inversion, IHI). We tested 3D-AGSCaps on three datasets with manually labeled hippocampi.
RESULTS: Our main results were: (1) 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a better Dice Coefficient compared to CNNs on rotated hippocampi (p=0.004, cohen's d=0.179); (2) on typical subjects, 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a Dice coefficient similar to CNNs while having 15 times fewer parameters (2.285M versus 35.069M). This may greatly facilitate the study of atypical subjects, including healthy and pathological cases like those presenting an IHI.
CONCLUSION: We expect our newly introduced 3D-AGSCaps to allow a more accurate and fully automated segmentation on atypical populations, small datasets, as well as on and large cohorts where manual segmentations are nearly intractable.",J Med Imaging (Bellingham),2024
39237365,Regulation of proteostasis by sleep through autophagy in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunctions are common clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that in addition to being a symptom, sleep disturbances can also drive the progression of neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of AD; however, the molecular pathways behind how sleep affects protein homeostasis remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that sleep modulation influences proteostasis and the progression of neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of tauopathy. We show that sleep deprivation enhanced Tau aggregational toxicity resulting in exacerbated synaptic degeneration. In contrast, sleep induction using gaboxadol led to reduced toxic Tau accumulation in neurons as a result of modulated autophagic flux and enhanced clearance of ubiquitinated Tau, suggesting altered protein processing and clearance that resulted in improved synaptic integrity and function. These findings highlight the complex relationship between sleep and regulation of protein homeostasis and the neuroprotective potential of sleep-enhancing therapeutics to slow the progression or delay the onset of neurodegeneration.",Life Sci Alliance,2024
39695808,Microglial CD2AP deficiency exerts protection in an Alzheimer's disease model of amyloidosis.,"BACKGROUND: The CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was initially identified in peripheral immune cells and regulates cytoskeleton and protein trafficking. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD2AP gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functional role of CD2AP, especially its role in microglia during AD onset, remains elusive.
METHODS: CD2AP protein levels in cultured primary cells and in 5xFAD mice was studied. Microglial CD2AP-deficient mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice and the offspring were subjected to neuropathological assessment, behavioral tests, electrophysiology, RNA-seq, Golgi staining, and biochemistry analysis. Primary microglia were also isolated for assessing their uptake and morphology changes.
RESULTS: We find that CD2AP is abundantly expressed in microglia and its levels are elevated in the brain of AD patients and the 5xFAD model mice at pathological stages. We demonstrate that CD2AP haploinsufficiency in microglia significantly attenuates cognitive and synaptic deficits, weakens the response of microglia to Aβ and the formation of disease-associated microglia (DAM), and alleviates synapse loss in 5xFAD mice. We show that CD2AP-deficient microglia exhibit compromised uptake ability. In addition, we find that CD2AP expression is positively correlated with the expression of the complement C1q that is important for synapse phagocytosis and the formation of DAM in response to Aβ deposition. Moreover, we reveal that CD2AP interacts with colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and regulates CSF1R cell surface levels, which may further affect C1q expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CD2AP regulates microgliosis and identify a protective function of microglial CD2AP deficiency against Aβ deposition, suggesting the importance of detailed investigation of AD-associated genes in different brain cells for thoroughly understanding their exact contribution to AD.",Mol Neurodegener,2024
39567476,The inhibitory action of the chaperone BRICHOS against the α-Synuclein secondary nucleation pathway.,"The complex kinetics of disease-related amyloid aggregation of proteins such as α-Synuclein (α-Syn) in Parkinson's disease and Aβ42 in Alzheimer's disease include primary nucleation, amyloid fibril elongation and secondary nucleation. The latter can be a key accelerator of the aggregation process. It has been demonstrated that the chaperone domain BRICHOS can interfere with the secondary nucleation process of Aβ42. Here, we explore the mechanism of secondary nucleation inhibition of the BRICHOS domain of the lung surfactant protein (proSP-C) against α-Syn aggregation and amyloid formation. We determine the 3D NMR structure of an inactive trimer of proSP-C BRICHOS and its active monomer using a designed mutant. Furthermore, the interaction between the proSP-C BRICHOS chaperone and a substrate peptide has been studied. NMR-based interaction studies of proSP-C BRICHOS with α-Syn fibrils show that proSP-C BRICHOS binds to the C-terminal flexible fuzzy coat of the fibrils, which is the secondary nucleation site on the fibrils. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that proSP-C BRICHOS runs along the fibrillar axis diffusion-dependently sweeping off monomeric α-Syn from the fibrils. The observed mechanism explains how a weakly binding chaperone can inhibit the α-Syn secondary nucleation pathway via avidity where a single proSP-C BRICHOS molecule is sufficient against up to ~7-40 α-Syn molecules embedded within the fibrils.",Nat Commun,2024
39639016,Homeostatic microglia initially seed and activated microglia later reshape amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The role of microglia in the amyloid cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is debated due to conflicting findings. Using a genetic and a pharmacological approach we demonstrate that depletion of microglia before amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition, leads to a reduction in plaque numbers and neuritic dystrophy, confirming their role in plaque initiation. Transplanting human microglia restores Aβ plaque formation. While microglia depletion reduces insoluble Aβ levels, soluble Aβ concentrations stay consistent, challenging the view that microglia clear Aβ. In later stages, microglial depletion decreases plaque compaction and increases neuritic dystrophy, suggesting a protective role. Human microglia with the TREM2<sup>R47H/R47H</sup> mutation exacerbate plaque pathology, emphasizing the importance of non-reactive microglia in the initiation of the amyloid cascade. Adaptive immune depletion (Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>) does not affect microglia's impact on plaque formation. These findings clarify conflicting reports, identifying microglia as key drivers of amyloid pathology, and raise questions about optimal therapeutic strategies for AD.",Nat Commun,2024
39521775,Multiplexed expansion revealing for imaging multiprotein nanostructures in healthy and diseased brain.,"Proteins work together in nanostructures in many physiological contexts and disease states. We recently developed expansion revealing (ExR), which expands proteins away from each other, in order to support better labeling with antibody tags and nanoscale imaging on conventional microscopes. Here, we report multiplexed expansion revealing (multiExR), which enables high-fidelity antibody visualization of >20 proteins in the same specimen, over serial rounds of staining and imaging. Across all datasets examined, multiExR exhibits a median round-to-round registration error of 39 nm, with a median registration error of 25 nm when the most stringent form of the protocol is used. We precisely map 23 proteins in the brain of 5xFAD Alzheimer's model mice, and find reductions in synaptic protein cluster volume, and co-localization of specific AMPA receptor subunits with amyloid-beta nanoclusters. We visualize 20 synaptic proteins in specimens of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. multiExR may be of broad use in analyzing how different kinds of protein are organized amidst normal and pathological processes in biology.",Nat Commun,2024
39277604,Lewy body pathology exacerbates brain hypometabolism and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"Identifying concomitant Lewy body (LB) pathology through seed amplification assays (SAA) might enhance the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice and trials. This study examined whether LB pathology exacerbates AD-related disease progression in 795 cognitively impaired individuals (Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia) from the longitudinal multi-center observational ADNI cohort. Participants were on average 75 years of age (SD = 7.89), 40.8% were female, 184 (23.1%) had no biomarker evidence of AD/LB pathology, 39 (4.9%) had isolated LB pathology (AD-LB+), 395 (49.7%) had only AD pathology (AD+LB-), and 177 (22.3%) had both pathologies (AD+LB+). The AD+LB+ group showed worst baseline performance for most cognitive outcomes and compared to the AD+LB- group faster global cognitive decline and more cortical hypometabolism, particularly in posterior brain regions. Neuropathological examination (n = 61) showed high sensitivity (26/27, 96.3%) and specificity (27/28, 96.4%) of the SAA-test. We showed that co-existing LB-positivity exacerbates cognitive decline and cortical brain hypometabolism in AD. In vivo LB pathology detection could enhance prognostic evaluations in clinical practice and could have implications for clinical AD trial design.",Nat Commun,2024
39271711,Therapeutic efficacy of intracerebral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"The conditions supporting the generation of microglia-like cells in the central nervous system (CNS) after transplantation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) have been studied to advance the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we explored the transplantation efficacy of different cell subsets and delivery routes with the goal of favoring the establishment of a stable and exclusive engraftment of HSPCs and their progeny in the CNS of female mice. In this setting, we show that the CNS environment drives the expansion, distribution and myeloid differentiation of the locally transplanted cells towards a microglia-like phenotype. Intra-CNS transplantation of HSPCs engineered to overexpress TREM2 decreased neuroinflammation, Aβ aggregation and improved memory in 5xFAD female mice. Our proof of concept study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of HSPC gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease.",Nat Commun,2024
39578645,Spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of genetic and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease.,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) depends on environmental and heritable factors, with its molecular etiology still unclear. Here we present a spatial transcriptomic (ST) and single-nucleus transcriptomic survey of late-onset sporadic AD and AD in Down syndrome (DSAD). Studying DSAD provides an opportunity to enhance our understanding of the AD transcriptome, potentially bridging the gap between genetic mouse models and sporadic AD. We identified transcriptomic changes that may underlie cortical layer-preferential pathology accumulation. Spatial co-expression network analyses revealed transient and regionally restricted disease processes, including a glial inflammatory program dysregulated in upper cortical layers and implicated in AD genetic risk and amyloid-associated processes. Cell-cell communication analysis further contextualized this gene program in dysregulated signaling networks. Finally, we generated ST data from an amyloid AD mouse model to identify cross-species amyloid-proximal transcriptomic changes with conformational context.",Nat Genet,2024
39719507,In vivo hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with synaptic loss and behavioral abnormalities in the absence of tau seeds.,"Tau pathology is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the sequence of events and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPT<sup>Int10+3G&gt;A</sup> and MAPT<sup>S305N;Int10+3G&gt;A</sup> lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance.",Nat Neurosci,2024
39764140,Targeting NLRP3 signaling with a novel sulfonylurea compound for the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia.,"BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and VaD + AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) on the 50<sup>th</sup> day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples were collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration, expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling pathways, tight junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels, while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.",Res Sq,2024
39678342,Ancestral Genomic Functional Differences in Oligodendroglia: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to elucidate ancestry-specific changes to the genomic regulatory architecture in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendroglia, focusing on their implications for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work addresses the lack of diversity in previous iPSC studies by including ancestries that contribute to African American (European/African) and Hispanic/Latino populations (Amerindian/African/European).
METHODS: We generated 12 iPSC lines-four African, four Amerindian, and four European- from both AD patients and non-cognitively impaired individuals, with varying APOE genotypes (APOE3/3 and APOE4/4). These lines were differentiated into neural spheroids containing oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing were employed to analyze transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiles, respectively. Differential gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and Hi-C analyses were conducted, followed by pathway analysis to interpret the results.
RESULTS: We identified ancestry-specific differences in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Notably, numerous AD GWAS-associated genes were differentially expressed across ancestries. The largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in European vs. Amerindian and African vs. Amerindian iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Pathway analysis of APOE4/4 carriers vs APOE3/3 carriers exhibited upregulation of a large number of disease and metabolic pathways in APOE4/4 individuals of all ancestries. Of particular interest was that APOE4/4 carriers had significantly upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis genes relative to APOE3/3 individuals across all ancestries, strongest in iOPCs. Comparison of iOPC and iOL transcriptome data with corresponding human frontal cortex data demonstrated a high correlation (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: This research emphasizes the importance of including diverse ancestries in AD research to uncover critical gene expression differences between populations and ancestries that may influence disease susceptibility and therapeutic interventions. The upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in APOE4/4 carriers of all three ancestries supports the concept that APOE4 may produce disease effects early in life, which could have therapeutic implications as we move forward towards specific therapy for APOE4 carriers. These findings and the high correlation between brain and iPSC-derived OPC and OL transcriptomes support the relevance of this approach as a model for disease study.",Res Sq,2024
39574903,"DNA methylation age from peripheral blood predicts progression to Alzheimer's disease, white matter disease burden, and cortical atrophy.","Cross-sectional studies suggest a limited relationship between accelerated epigenetic aging derived from epigenetic clocks, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology or risk. However, most prior analyses have not utilized longitudinal analyses or whole-brain neuroimaging biomarkers of AD. Herein, we employed longitudinal modeling and structural neuroimaging analyses to test the hypothesis that accelerated epigenetic aging would predict AD progression. Using survival analyses, we found that two second generation epigenetic clocks, DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge, predicted progression from cognitively normal aging to mild cognitive impairment or AD and worse longitudinal cognitive outcomes. Epigenetic age was also strongly associated with cortical thinning in AD-relevant regions and white matter disease burden. Thus, in contrast to earlier work suggesting limited applicability of blood-based epigenetic clocks in AD, our novel analytic framework suggests that second-generation epigenetic clocks have broad utility and may represent promising predictors of AD risk and pathophysiology.",Res Sq,2024
38941473,Neural circuits expressing the serotonin 2C receptor regulate memory in mice and humans.,"Declined memory is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experiments in rodents and human postmortem studies suggest that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays a role in memory, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the role of 5-HT 2C receptor (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R) in regulating memory. Transgenic mice expressing a humanized HTR2C mutation exhibit impaired plasticity of hippocampal ventral CA1 (vCA1) neurons and reduced memory. Further, 5-HT neurons project to and synapse onto vCA1 neurons. Disruption of 5-HT synthesis in vCA1-projecting neurons or deletion of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs in the vCA1 impairs neural plasticity and memory. We show that a selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist, lorcaserin, improves synaptic plasticity and memory in an AD mouse model. Cumulatively, we demonstrate that hippocampal 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R signaling regulates memory, which may inform the use of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists in the treatment of dementia.",Sci Adv,2024
39732953,Enhancing early detection of Alzheimer's disease through hybrid models based on feature fusion of multi-CNN and handcrafted features.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disorder that causes memory loss and behavioral and thinking problems. The symptoms of Alzheimer's are similar throughout its development stages, which makes it difficult to diagnose manually. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques address the limitations of manual diagnosis. In this study, the images were enhanced and the active contour algorithm (ACA) was used to extract regions of interest (ROI) such as soft tissue and white matter. Strategies have been developed to diagnose AD and differentiate its stages. The first strategy is using XGBoost and ANN networks with the features of MobileNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet models. The second strategy is by XGBoost and ANN networks with combined features of MobileNet-DenseNet121, DenseNet121-GoogLeNet and MobileNet-GoogLeNet. The third strategy combines XGBoost and ANN networks with combined features of MobileNet-DenseNet121-Handcrafted, DenseNet121-GoogLeNet-Handcrafted, and MobileNet-GoogLeNet-Handcrafted leading to improved accuracy of the strategies and improved efficiency. XGBoost with hybrid features of DenseNet-GoogLeNet-Handcrafted achieved an AUC of 98.82%, accuracy of 98.8%, sensitivity of 98.9%, accuracy of 97.08%, and specificity of 99.5%.",Sci Rep,2024
39358318,The involvement of K<sup>+</sup> channels in depression and pharmacological effects of antidepressants on these channels.,"Depression is a common and complex psychiatric illness with multiple clinical symptoms, even leading to the disability and suicide. Owing to the partial understanding of the pathogenesis of depressive-like disorders, available pharmacotherapeutic strategies are developed mainly based on the ""monoamine hypothesis"", resulting in a limited effectiveness and a number of adverse effects in the clinical practice. The concept of multiple pathogenic factors be helpful for clarifying the etiology of depression and developing the antidepressants. It is well documented that K<sup>+</sup> channels serve crucial roles in modulating the neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release in the brain, and abnormality of these channels participated in the pathogenic process of diverse central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, such as seizure and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The clinical and preclinical evidence also delineates that the involvement of several types of K<sup>+</sup> channels in depressive-like behaviors appear to be evident, suggesting these channels being one of the multiple factors in the etiology of this debilitating disorder. Emerging data manifest that diverse antidepressants impact distinct K<sup>+</sup> channels, such as Kv, Kir and K<sub>2P</sub>, meaning the functioning of these drug via a ""multi-target"" manner. On the other hand, the scenario of antidepressants impinging K<sup>+</sup> channels could render an alternative interpretation for the pharmacological effectiveness and numerous side effects in clinical trials. Furthermore, these channels serve to be considered as a ""druggable target"" to develop novel therapeutic compound to antagonize this psychiatry.",Transl Psychiatry,2024
38806463,Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses support causal relationships between structural and diffusion imaging-derived phenotypes and the risk of major neurodegenerative diseases.,"Previous observational investigations suggest that structural and diffusion imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) are associated with major neurodegenerative diseases; however, whether these associations are causal remains largely uncertain. Herein we conducted bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses to infer the causal relationships between structural and diffusion IDPs and major neurodegenerative diseases using common genetic variants-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of genome-wide association study (GWAS) for structural and diffusion IDPs were obtained from 33,224 individuals in the UK Biobank cohort. Summary statistics of GWAS for seven major neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from the largest GWAS for each disease to date. The forward MR analyses identified significant or suggestively statistical causal effects of genetically predicted three structural IDPs on Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and multiple sclerosis. For example, the reduction in the surface area of the left superior temporal gyrus was associated with a higher risk of AD. The reverse MR analyses identified significantly or suggestively statistical causal effects of genetically predicted AD, Lewy body dementia (LBD), and FTD on nine structural and diffusion IDPs. For example, LBD was associated with increased mean diffusivity in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and AD was associated with decreased gray matter volume in the right ventral striatum. Our findings might contribute to shedding light on the prediction and therapeutic intervention for the major neurodegenerative diseases at the neuroimaging level.",Transl Psychiatry,2024
38658547,Exercise mitigates a gut microbiota-mediated reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and associated behaviours in rats.,"Lifestyle factors, especially exercise, impact the manifestation and progression of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as depression and Alzheimer's disease, mediated by changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity. The beneficial effects of exercise may be due to its promotion of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Gut microbiota has also been showed to be altered in a variety of brain disorders, and disturbances of the microbiota have resulted in alterations in brain and behaviour. However, whether exercise can counteract the negative effects of altered gut microbiota on brain function remains under explored. To this end, chronic disruption of the gut microbiota was achieved using an antibiotic cocktail in rats that were sedentary or allowed voluntary access to running wheels. Sedentary rats with disrupted microbiota displayed impaired performance in hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent tasks: the modified spontaneous location recognition task and the novelty suppressed feeding test. Performance in the elevated plus maze was also impaired due to antibiotics treatment. These behaviours, and an antibiotics-induced reduction in AHN were attenuated by voluntary exercise. The effects were independent of changes in the hippocampal metabolome but were paralleled by caecal metabolomic changes. Taken together these data highlight the importance of the gut microbiota in AHN-dependent behaviours and demonstrate the power of lifestyle factors such as voluntary exercise to attenuate these changes.",Transl Psychiatry,2024
39349438,Defective regulation of the eIF2-eIF2B translational axis underlies depressive-like behavior in mice and correlates with major depressive disorder in humans.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant cause of disability in adults worldwide. However, the underlying causes and mechanisms of MDD are not fully understood, and many patients are refractory to available therapeutic options. Impaired control of brain mRNA translation underlies several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, a potential role for mechanisms associated with impaired translational control in depressive-like behavior remains elusive. A key pathway controlling translation initiation relies on the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α-P) which, in turn, blocks the guanine exchange factor activity of eIF2B, thereby reducing global translation rates. Here we report that the expression of EIF2B5 (which codes for eIF2Bε, the catalytic subunit of eIF2B) is reduced in postmortem MDD prefrontal cortex from two distinct human cohorts and in the frontal cortex of social isolation-induced depressive-like behavior model mice. Further, pharmacological treatment with anisomycin or with salubrinal, an inhibitor of the eIF2α phosphatase GADD34, induces depressive-like behavior in adult C57BL/6J mice. Salubrinal-induced depressive-like behavior is blocked by ISRIB, a compound that directly activates eIF2B regardless of the phosphorylation status of eIF2α, suggesting that increased eIF2α-P promotes depressive-like states. Taken together, our results suggest that impaired eIF2-associated translational control may participate in the pathophysiology of MDD, and underscore eIF2-eIF2B translational axis as a potential target for the development of novel approaches for MDD and related mood disorders.",Transl Psychiatry,2024
39039061,The mediating effect of the amygdala-frontal circuit on the association between depressive symptoms and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.,"Depressive symptoms occur commonly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although abnormalities in the amygdala-frontal circuit have been linked to emotional dysregulation and cognitive impairment, the neurological basis underlying these associations in AD patients with depressive symptoms (ADD) is unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the amygdala-frontal circuit and depressive symptoms and cognitive function in ADD. We recruited 60 ADD, 60 AD patients without depressive symptoms (ADND), and 60 healthy controls (HC). Functional connectivity (FC) maps of the bilateral amygdala were compared. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the amygdala-frontal circuit connected by the uncinate fasciculus (UF) was calculated using automated fiber quantification (AFQ). In addition, mediation analysis was performed to explore the effects of the amygdala-frontal circuit on the relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive function. We found decreased bilateral amygdala FC with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the ADD group compared to the ADND and HC groups. Moreover, FA in the left frontal UF (nodes 64-97) was significantly lower in the ADD group than ADND group. Notably, amygdala-based FC with IFG and the left frontal UF FA mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive function in ADD, with mediating effects ranging between 15 and 18%. Our study is the first to demonstrate the mediating effect of functional and microstructural abnormalities in the amygdala-frontal circuit in ADD. The findings suggest that the amygdala-frontal circuit may underlie emotional dysregulation in ADD, providing potential targets for treatment strategies.",Transl Psychiatry,2024
39620130,Mathematical model of the Alzheimer's disease biomarker cascade demonstrates statistical pitfall in identifying surrogates of cognitive reserve.,"Statistical interaction analyses with biomarkers of pathology on cognitive outcome have been put forward to investigate neurobiological surrogates of cognitive reserve in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, as these potential surrogates are likely affected by neurodegeneration during the course of AD, their joint alteration with biomarkers of pathology and cognitive outcome during disease progression may introduce misinterpretable interaction effects in cross-sectional studies. To demonstrate this, we conducted interaction analyses on synthetic data from a mathematical model of the AD biomarker cascade. When randomly sampling cross-sectionally, these gave interaction effects, which greatly reduced when controlling for the corresponding time point of each sampled data point. Cross-sectional studies investigating cognitive reserve using interaction analyses are advised to take into account the different time stages of the disease that individual data points represent.",iScience,2024
40235115,Analyzing heterogeneity in Alzheimer disease using multimodal normative modeling on imaging-based ATN biomarkers.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have applied normative modeling on a single neuroimaging modality to investigate Alzheimer disease (AD) heterogeneity. We employed a deep learning-based multimodal normative framework to analyze individual-level variation across ATN (amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration) imaging biomarkers.
METHODS: We selected cross-sectional discovery (n = 665) and replication cohorts (n = 430) with available T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid, and tau positron emission tomography (PET). Normative modeling estimated individual-level abnormal deviations in amyloid-positive individuals compared to amyloid-negative controls. Regional abnormality patterns were mapped at different clinical group levels to assess intra-group heterogeneity. An individual-level disease severity index (DSI) was calculated using both the spatial extent and magnitude of abnormal deviations across ATN.
RESULTS: Greater intra-group heterogeneity in ATN abnormality patterns was observed in more severe clinical stages of AD. Higher DSI was associated with worse cognitive function and increased risk of disease progression.
DISCUSSION: Subject-specific abnormality maps across ATN reveal the heterogeneous impact of AD on the brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: Normative modeling examined AD heterogeneity across multimodal imaging biomarkers. Heterogeneity in spatial patterns of gray matter atrophy, amyloid, and tau burden. Higher within-group heterogeneity for AD patients at advanced dementia stages. Patient-specific metric summarized extent of neurodegeneration and neuropathology. Metric is a marker of poor brain health and can monitor risk of disease progression.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40225240,Measuring time saved in Alzheimer's disease: What is a meaningful slowing of progression?,"INTRODUCTION: Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have previously been estimated using clinician-based anchors. However, MCIDs have been criticized for not reflecting the preferences of people living with AD (PLWAD). Furthermore, interpretations of clinical trial results have been criticized for conflating within-person meaningfulness thresholds and between-group differences. Here, we simulate scenarios of disease slowing and compare those to published MCIDs.
METHODS: Scenarios of 5%-95% disease slowing were simulated using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. Time saved and point differences on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were estimated for these scenarios and compared to published MCIDs.
RESULTS: Scenario analyses resulted in estimates of time saved at ∼3 weeks-17 months and mean changes at 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points over 18 months. The often referenced MCID for mild cognitive impairment (0.98) thereby corresponded to 11 months slowing, whereas the MCID for mild dementia (1.63) corresponded to >17 months slowing.
DISCUSSION: Translating trial endpoints to estimates of time saved supports that often-referenced MCIDs may not be aligned with realistic and meaningful slowing of clinical progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD slowing of clinical progression by 5%-95% resulted in 0.74-17 months saved and 0.08-1.5 CDR-SB points change at 18 months.Slowing of at least 60% or 11 months of time saved over 18 months met an often-cited MCID threshold of 0.98 points for mild cognitive impairment.For mild AD dementia, an MCID of 1.63 meant that even an 18-month delay over 18 months would be considered only borderline meaningful-a face invalid and unrealistic proposition.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
40120077,The relationship between kidney health and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are multi-faceted disorders influenced by and affecting more than just the brain and nervous system. Here, we provide a review of the potential links, including mechanistic and genetic, between kidney health and neurodegeneration, mainly dementia and the two most prevalent late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We also discuss lines of evidence from various study designs and methodologies that either support or do not support an association between kidney health and neurodegeneration. We conclude with a summary of current gaps and provide possible ways forward to overcome them in future research. The goal of this review is to encourage further exploration of the relationship between these two biological systems to better elucidate potential actionable options to improve brain health.",Brain,2025
39988890,Generation of an Inducible Destabilized-Domain Cre Mouse Line to Target Disease Associated Microglia.,"The function of microglia during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be investigated using mouse models that enable genetic manipulation of microglial subpopulations in a temporal manner. We developed mouse lines that express either Cre recombinase (Cre) for constitutive targeting, or destabilized-domain Cre recombinase (DD-Cre) for inducible targeting from the Cst7 locus (Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup>) to specifically manipulate disease associated microglia (DAM) and crossed with Ai14 tdTomato cre-reporter line mice. Cst7<sup>Cre</sup> was found to target all brain resident myeloid cells, due to transient developmental expression of Cst7, but no expression was found in the inducible Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup> mice. Further crossing of this line with 5xFAD mice combined with dietary administration of trimethoprim to induce DD-Cre activity produces long-term labeling in DAM without evidence of leakiness, with tdTomato-expression restricted to cells surrounding plaques. Using this model, we found that DAMs are a subset of plaque-associated microglia (PAMs) and their transition to DAM increases with age and disease stage. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that tdTomato+ cells show higher expression of disease and inflammatory genes compared to other microglial populations, including non-labeled PAMs. These models allow either complete cre-loxP targeting of all brain myeloid cells (Cst7<sup>Cre</sup>), or inducible targeting of DAMs, without leakiness (Cst7<sup>DD-Cre</sup>).",Glia,2025
40210453,Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for major neurocognitive disorders.,"Disease-modifying treatments for major neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other cognitive deficits, are among the main unmet needs in modern medicine. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), currently licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, offer a novel, multilayered mechanism for intervention in neurodegeneration through intermediate, aetiology-agnostic pathways, likely involving metabolic, inflammatory and several other relevant neurobiological processes. In vitro and animal studies have revealed promising signals of neuroprotection, with preliminary supportive evidence emerging from recent pharmacoepidemiological investigations and clinical trials. In this article, we comprehensively review studies that investigate the impact of GLP-1RAs on the various aetiologies of cognitive impairment and dementia syndromes. Focusing on evidence from human studies, we highlight how brain energy homeostasis, neurogenesis, synaptic functioning, neuroinflammation and other cellular stress responses, pathological protein aggregates, proteostasis, cerebrovascular system and blood-brain barrier dynamics may underlie GLP-1RA putative neuroprotective effects. We then report and appraise evidence from clinical studies, including observational investigations, clinical trials and pooled analyses. Finally, we discuss current challenges and perspectives ahead for research and clinical implementation of GLP-1RAs for the care of people with major neurocognitive disorders, including their individual brain penetrance potential, the need for response biomarkers and disease stage-based indications, their possible non-specific effects on brain health, their profile in terms of adverse events and other unwanted effects, the lack of long-term data for efficacy and safety, and issues surrounding cost and availability of treatment.",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,2025
