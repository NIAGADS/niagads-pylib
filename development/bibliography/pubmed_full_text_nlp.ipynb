Therefore, SPF-grade male APP/PS1 mouse (9 months old, weighing 32\\u2009±\\u20093\\xa0g) were used in this study. These mouse were obtained from the Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The facility maintained a constant temperature of 23±\\u20092\\xa0°C, with relative humidity regulated between 40% and 60%. A 12-hour light/dark cycle was implemented to ensure proper illumination.
