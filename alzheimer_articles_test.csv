39820537,Association of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration with gait performance in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Declining gait performance is seen in aging individuals, due to neural and systemic factors. Plasma biomarkers provide an accessible way to assess evolving brain changes; non-specific neurodegeneration (NfL, GFAP) or evolving Alzheimer's disease (Aβ 42/40 ratio, P-Tau181).
METHODS: In a population-based cohort of older adults, we evaluate the hypothesis that plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease pathology are associated with worse gait performance. A sample of 2641 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants with measurements of plasma biomarkers and gait parameters was analyzed in this cross-sectional study. Linear regression models using plasma biomarkers as predictors of gait parameters and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and cognitive diagnosis were evaluated.
RESULTS: In this study multiple statistically significant relationships are observed for GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 with gait parameters. Each standard deviation increase in GFAP, NfL, and P-Tau181 is associated with a reduction in velocity of 2.100 (95% CI: -3.004, -1.196; p = 5.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), 4.400 (-5.292, -3.507; p = 9.5 × 10<sup>-22</sup>), and 2.617 (-3.414, -1.819; p = 1.5 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) cm/sec, respectively. Overall, NfL has the strongest associations with poor gait performance. Models with age interactions show that the strength of associations between the plasma biomarkers and the gait parameters became stronger with increasing age. There are no specific gait parameters that associate with individual plasma biomarkers.
CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease pathology are not only markers of cognitive decline but also indicate motor decline in the aging population.",Commun Med (Lond),2025
40134415,Early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease through data fusion of MRI and DTI images using the YOLOv11 neural network.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, affecting over 55 million people globally, with numbers expected to rise dramatically. Early detection and classification of AD are crucial for improving patient outcomes and slowing disease progression. However, conventional diagnostic approaches often fail to provide accurate classification in the early stages. This paper proposes a novel approach using advanced computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems and the YOLOv11 neural network for early detection and classification of AD. The YOLOv11 model leverages its advanced object detection capabilities to simultaneously localize and classify AD-related biomarkers by integrating multimodal data fusion of T2-weighted MRI and DTI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected and annotated based on known AD biomarkers, and the YOLOv11 model was trained to classify AD into four stages: Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The model achieved exceptional performance, with 93.6% precision, 91.6% recall, and 96.7% mAP50, demonstrating its ability to identify subtle biomarkers by combining MRI and DTI modalities. This work highlights the novelty of using YOLOv11 for simultaneous detection and classification, offering a promising strategy for early-stage AD diagnosis and classification.",Front Neurosci,2025
40081988,The late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk factor RHBDF2 is a modifier of microglial TREM2 proteolysis.,"The cell surface receptor TREM2 is a key genetic risk factor and drug target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the brain, TREM2 is expressed in microglia, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage, linked to AD risk, but the responsible protease in microglia is still unknown. Another microglial-expressed AD risk factor is catalytically inactive rhomboid 2 (iRhom2, RHBDF2), which binds to and acts as a non-catalytic subunit of the metalloprotease ADAM17. A potential role in TREM2 proteolysis is not yet known. Using microglial-like BV2 cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and primary murine microglia, we identify iRhom2 as a modifier of ADAM17-mediated TREM2 shedding. Loss of iRhom2 increased TREM2 in cell lysates and at the cell surface and enhanced TREM2 signaling and microglial phagocytosis of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). This study establishes ADAM17 as a physiological TREM2 protease in microglia and suggests iRhom2 as a potential drug target for modulating TREM2 proteolysis in AD.",Life Sci Alliance,2025
40043111,Sex differences in age-associated neurological diseases-A roadmap for reliable and high-yield research.,"Once taken into consideration, sex differences in neurological diseases emerge in abundance: (i) Stroke severity is significantly higher in females than in males, (ii) Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is more pronounced in females, and (iii) conspicuous links with hormonal cycles led to female-specific diagnoses, such as catamenial migraines and epilepsy. While these differences receive increasing attention in isolation, they likely link to similar processes in the brain. Hence, this review aims to present an overview of the influences of sex chromosomes, hormones, and aging on male and female brains across health and disease, with a particular focus on AD and stroke. The focus here on advancements across several fields holds promise to fuel future research and to lead to an enriched understanding of the brain and more effective personalized neurologic care for all.",Sci Adv,2025
39935389,Influence of alpha-synuclein on glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease continuum: Analyses of α-synuclein seed amplification assay and FDG-PET.,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the association between alpha-synuclein (α-syn) pathology and brain glucose metabolism across the cognitive spectrum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) co-pathologies.
METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data from 829 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (648 cognitively impaired [CI], 181 unimpaired [CU]) were compared between α-syn seed amplification assay (SAA) positive and negative groups. Interactions with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers were examined.
RESULTS: SAA+ was associated with widespread hypometabolism among CI individuals, particularly in posterior cortical regions, independent of CSF amyloid and tau levels in the occipital lobes. Regional hypometabolism mediated the effect of α-syn SAA on disease severity in CI individuals, independent of CSF amyloid and tau levels. There were no influences of SAA on FDG-PET in CU individuals.
DISCUSSION: This study supports a model in which α-syn aggregation influences metabolic dysfunction, which then influences clinical disease severity, independent of AD. SAA+ could help optimize participant selection and outcome measures for clinical trials in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: α-synuclein seed amplification positivity (SAA+) was associated with hypometabolism in cognitively impaired individuals. Hypometabolism mediated the influence of α-synuclein on disease severity. Occipital hypometabolism in SAA+ was independent of cerebrospinal fluid levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology. These findings can optimize future clinical trials targeting α-synuclein pathology.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39975464,Two new positive psychosocial measures for persons living with dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Differences in adaptive strategies used by individuals and families living with dementia have the potential to impact day-to-day well-being. The Living Well Inventory for Dementia (LWI-D) is a new measure to capture these strategies and to illuminate new options to support families living with dementia. The Quality of Day Scale (QODS) is a new measure to capture global well-being in persons based on a shorter temporal frame than traditional quality of life measures. This article summarizes the initial evaluation of the LWI-D and the QODS for face validity, content validity, and user acceptability.
METHODS: Initial acceptability and feasibility testing were conducted with a sample of 17 community-dwelling individuals with early-stage dementia (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] scores of 12-30).After revision and optimization of the two measures, a second pilot test was conducted with a sample of 30 dyads (persons living with dementia and family caregivers) in nursing home, assisted living, and community settings.
RESULTS: Data from both pilot studies are reported including item analysis and quantitative and qualitative results. Outcomes related to convergent validity between the LWI-D and the QODS with measures of positive affect-balance, quality of life, and well-being are presented. Within-dyad differences in ratings on both measures are discussed.
DISCUSSION: The LWI-D and the QODS are developing measures that warrant further testing and may enhance the ability to (1) identify strengths in living well with dementia, and (2) identify and test new interventions to bolster care and support.
HIGHLIGHTS: This article describes the process used to develop and test two new measures for research and clinical practice related to positive psychosocial approaches to dementia.The measures were developed with a team that included persons living with Alzheimer's disease as co-researchers in the process.A novel method of human-centered design was used to cultivate deep empathy, generate options, and conduct small, iterative tests of prototype measures.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39868844,Exploring the role of T cells in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases: Emerging therapeutic insights from the T Cells in the Brain symposium.,"This proceedings article summarizes the inaugural ""T Cells in the Brain"" symposium held at Columbia University. Experts gathered to explore the role of T cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Key topics included characterization of antigen-specific immune responses, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, microbial etiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia-T cell crosstalk, with a focus on how T cells affect neuroinflammation and AD biomarkers like amyloid beta and tau. The symposium also examined immunotherapies for AD, including the Valacyclovir Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (VALAD) trial, and two clinical trials leveraging regulatory T cell approaches for multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy. Additionally, single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of T cells and other immune cells provided insights into immune dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. This article highlights key findings from the symposium and outlines future research directions to further understand the role of T cells in neurodegeneration, offering innovative therapeutic approaches for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Researchers gathered to discuss approaches to study T cells in brain disorders. New technologies allow high-throughput screening of antigen-specific T cells. Microbial infections can precede several serious and chronic neurological diseases. Central and peripheral T cell responses shape neurological disease pathology. Immunotherapy can induce regulatory T cell responses in neuroinflammatory disorders.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39723106,The CSF p-tau/β-amyloid 42 ratio correlates with brain structure and fibrillary β-amyloid deposition in cognitively unimpaired individuals at the earliest stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease.,"CSF concentrations of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and have been studied in relation to several neuropathological features both in patients and in cognitively unimpaired individuals. The CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, a biomarker combining information from both pathophysiological processes, has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring disease progression, even at pre-clinical stages. Here, we studied the association between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio with downstream markers of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease progression including brain structure, glucose metabolism, fibrillary Aβ deposition and cognitive performance in 234 cognitively unimpaired individuals, who underwent cognitive testing, a lumbar puncture, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-flutemetamol PET scanning. We evaluated both main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's disease risk factors, such as older age, female sex and the apoliporoptein E (APOE)-ɛ4 allele, in a priori defined regions of interest and further examined the associations on the whole-brain using voxel-wise regressions. In addition, as the association between CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain structure and function may be non-linear, we tested the interaction between the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio and stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease defined using the amyloid (A) and tau (T) classification. We found significantly positive associations between CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and both cortical Aβ deposition and regional grey matter volume while no effect was observed for brain metabolism. A significant interaction with age indicated that, for the same level of CSF p-tau/Aβ42, older individuals displayed both increased Aβ deposition and lower grey matter volume, in widespread cortical areas. In addition, we found that women compared with men had a greater Aβ fibrillary accumulation in midline cortical areas and inferior temporal regions, for the same level of the CSF biomarker. The impact of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 on grey matter volume was modulated by AT stages, with A+T+ individuals displaying significantly less positive associations in areas of early atrophy in the Alzheimer's continuum. Finally, we found that sex and APOE-ɛ4 modulated the association between the CSF biomarker and episodic memory as well as abstract reasoning, respectively. Our data indicate that the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio is strongly associated with multiple downstream neuropathological events in cognitively unimpaired individuals and may thus serve as a potent biomarker to investigate the earliest changes in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease. Given that its impact on both Aβ deposition and grey matter volume is modulated by specific risk factors, our results highlight the need to take into account such predisposing variables in both clinical practice and prevention trials.",Brain Commun,2025
39868808,Current practices by Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers to remunerate research participants.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent guidance from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) recommends remuneration for all Alzheimer's disease (AD) research participants. Given AD research recruitment challenges, we assessed the remuneration practices at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs).
METHODS: We surveyed 37 ADRCs about remuneration for longitudinal research participants. This included type of remuneration (i.e., compensation, reimbursement) and which study procedures are remunerated. We had a 100% response rate.
RESULTS: Most ADRCs (32/37) provide some remuneration but amounts and types varied. Most ADRCs reimburse for travel or food (n = 29), compensate for some study procedures (n = 32), but most do not remunerate study partners (n = 12) or offer financial incentives (n = 8). Few (n = 6) ADRCs pay for all procedures.
DISCUSSION: Two areas for potential change are compensating for annual clinical and cognitive assessments that are compulsory, and for study partners. Evaluation of the impact of remuneration on recruitment and retention is needed, including for underrepresented groups.
HIGHLIGHTS: Recent guidance recommends remuneration for Alzheimer's disease research participants. We surveyed all Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers about their remuneration practices. Most centers provide some form of remuneration to participants but this is variable. Potential areas for change are remuneration for study partners and annual study visits. Evaluating the impact of remuneration on recruitment and retention is needed.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39748840,The African Initiative for Bioinformatics Online Training in Neurodegenerative Diseases (AI-BOND): Investing in the next generation of African neuroscientists.,"UNLABELLED: Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD), pose significant challenges to health care systems globally, particularly in Africa. With the advances in medical technology and research capabilities, especially in next-generation sequencing and imaging, vast amounts of data have been generated from AD/ADRD research. Given that the greatest increase in AD/ADRD prevalence is expected to occur in Africa, it is critical to establish comprehensive bioinformatics training programs to help African scientists leverage existing data and collect additional information to untangle AD/ADRD heterogeneity in African populations. The South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, with efforts from the National Institutes of Health and the Global Brain Health Institute, has partnered with the Brain Research Africa Initiative to develop the African Initiative on Bioinformatics Online Training in Neurodegenerative Disease (AI-BOND). AI-BOND is a comprehensive and accessible training program, the aim of which is to advance biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise in Africa in studying neurodegenerative diseases. This expertise is essential to enable African scientists to utilize the extensive AD/ADRD data and enhance the continent's ability to contribute to global research efforts in this field. The training addresses the gap in analyzing neurodegenerative disease data by providing skills and knowledge in genetic epidemiology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics to African students and researchers. This innovative online training program will last 6 months and provide training in skill sets R, SAS, and Python programing, genome-wide association studies, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome analysis, and advanced statistical methods. Additional training will include study design and manuscript and grant writing. The first cohort of the AI-BOND program will graduate in June 2024. The AI-BOND program is expected to build research computational capacities in Africa that will improve the ability of graduates to conduct and utilize large-scale studies, with the goal of curbing the growing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in Africa.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) pose significant health challenges globally, particularly in Africa.The most significant AD/ADRD prevalence increase is predicted to occur in Africa.It is crucial to establish a bioinformatics training capacity in Africa to leverage the vast number of multi-omics and imaging biomarkers of AD/ADRD data being generated.The African Initiative on Bioinformatics Online Training in Neurodegenerative Disease (AI-BOND) training addresses the gaps in study design, biostatistics, genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics related to neurodegenerative diseases in Africa.The success of AI-BOND is anticipated to help build computational research capacities in Africa.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39773760,Neuronal CD59 isoforms IRIS-1 and IRIS-2 as regulators of neurotransmitter release with implications for Alzheimer's disease.,"We have previously demonstrated that the intracellular, non-GPI anchored CD59 isoforms IRIS-1 and IRIS-2 (Isoforms Rescuing Insulin Secretion 1 and 2) are necessary for insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. While investigating their expression across human tissues, we identified IRIS-1 and IRIS-2 mRNA in the human brain, though their protein expression and function remained unclear. This study shows the presence of both IRIS-1 and 2 proteins in the human brain, specifically in neurons and astrocytes. In the neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), both isoforms are intracellular, and their expression increases upon differentiation into mature neurons. Silencing IRIS-1 and 2 in SH-SY5Y cells reduces the SNARE complex formation, essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, leading to a reduction in noradrenaline secretion. Notably, we observed diminished expression of neuronal IRIS-1 and 2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-demented individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In SH-SY5Y cells, knockdown of all isoforms of CD59 including IRIS-1 and 2 not only elevates phosphorylated tau but also increases cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) expression, known promoter of hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau, a key pathological feature of AD. Additionally, we found that prolonged exposure to high glucose or cytokines markedly reduces the expression of IRIS-1 and 2 in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting a link between AD pathology and metabolic stress through modulation of these isoforms.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
40004464,Genomic and Transcriptomic Approaches Advance the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), represent a growing societal challenge due to their irreversible progression and significant impact on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Despite advances in clinical and imaging-based diagnostics, these diseases are often detected at advanced stages, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Recent breakthroughs in genomic and transcriptomic technologies, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and CRISPR-based screens, have revolutionized the field, offering new avenues for early diagnosis and personalized prognosis. Genomic approaches have elucidated disease-specific genetic risk factors and molecular pathways, while transcriptomic studies have identified stage-specific biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and severity. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), and spatial transcriptomics are enabling the stratification of patients based on their risk profiles and prognostic trajectories. Advances in functional genomics have uncovered actionable targets, such as ATXN2 in ALS and TREM2 in AD, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies. Despite these achievements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into clinical practice due to disease heterogeneity and the complexity of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Future integration of genetic technologies holds promise for transforming diagnostic and prognostic paradigms, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and precision medicine approaches.",Genes (Basel),2025
39696024,A case report about focal status epilepticus as first presentation in Alzheimer's disease: finding the culprit.,"BACKGROUND: Neuronal hyperexcitability has been proposed to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the relation between this enhanced excitability and AD pathology could provide a window for therapeutic interventions. However epileptiform activity is often subclinical, hidden on scalp EEG and very challenging to assess with current diagnostic modalities.
CASE PRESENTATION: A woman in her sixties presented with acute confusion. Despite a normal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cytotoxic edema of the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampal hypermetabolism was present on ([<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). Bilateral foramen ovale (FO) electrodes were placed to directly record mesial temporal activity and revealed continuous mesial temporal epileptic activity, while scalp EEG remained normal. After recovery, a new diagnosis of AD was established on cerebrospinal fluid. The lateralization of the epileptiform activity was congruent with the predominant side of tau pathology in the mesial temporal cortex on <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240 PET. On follow-up MRI, two and five months later, the right hippocampus became atrophic.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the significant role of neuronal hyperexcitability in early AD pathogenesis and how shared mechanisms between AD and epilepsy can complicate clinical management.",BMC Neurol,2024
39933337,Exploring the domain specificity and the neural correlates of memory unawareness in Alzheimer's disease.,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are less accurate than controls to predict their episodic performance, but they are as accurate as controls to predict their semantic performance. However, the dissociation between episodic and semantic metamemory had never been tested directly in the same patients. This study aimed to explore the dissociation between episodic and semantic metamemory in AD using the feeling-of-knowing paradigm. In addition, we investigated the link between memory awareness and resting-state cerebral glucose metabolism and gray matter density, in episodic and semantic tasks independently. Data from 50 patients with AD were compared to data from 30 healthy controls. Results showed that patients with AD had more difficulties to predict their recognition in the episodic task than in the semantic task, while this difference was smaller in controls. However, this dissociation was only shown with a measure of absolute accuracy, but not with a measure of relative accuracy. Lack of awareness in the episodic task was associated with hypometabolism in right frontoparietal areas in patients with AD, while semantic metamemory was associated with gray matter integrity in the left angular gyrus. The consequence of metacognitive bias and memory status on metamemory judgments are discussed.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
40002463,"Mitochondrial Dysfunction Correlates with Brain Amyloid Binding, Memory, and Executive Function in Down Syndrome: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome.","Background/Objectives: Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a central contributor to neurodegenerative diseases and age-related cognitive decline. Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of neurodegeneration due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to explore the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and cognitive decline in this population. Methods: We investigated mitochondrial function, brain amyloid-beta burden, and cognitive performance in a pilot study of a cohort of 10 eligible adults with DS selected from a sample of 28 individuals with DS. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) was used to assess mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle using a post-exercise paradigm, while positron emission tomography using <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) measured brain Aβ deposition. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination adapted for individuals with Down syndrome (CAMCOG-DS) and executive function batteries. Results: Significant correlations were observed between slowed phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery in muscle and increased Aβ deposition in key brain regions, particularly the striatum. Cognitive performance inversely correlated with mitochondrial function, with pronounced deficits in memory and executive function tasks. Notably, an individual carrying the APOE-ε4 allele exhibited the poorest mitochondrial function, highest Aβ burden, and most severe cognitive impairment, suggesting a potential interaction between genetic risk and mitochondrial health. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in DS-associated AD (DSAD) and its impact on cognition in adults. The results support targeting mitochondrial pathways as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate AD progression in DS populations. Further research with larger cohorts and longitudinal designs is needed to clarify causative mechanisms and develop effective interventions.",Brain Sci,2025
40194375,Role of the UNC13 Family in Human Diseases: A Literature Review (P9-2.003).,"OBJECTIVE: This literature review examines the roles of the Uncoordinated-13 (UNC13) protein family in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, their implications in neurological and immunological disorders, and their potential therapeutic strategies and directions for future research.
BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in molecular research have underscored the significance of the UNC13 protein family in human health, particularly in neurological and immune-related diseases. The UNC13 proteins are evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in synaptic vesicle priming, exocytosis, and immune cell function. Dysfunction or genetic variations in these proteins have been linked to a range of disorders.
DESIGN/METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted, and relevant articles from the past 20 years were included in the final manuscript. A narrative review was then conducted to investigate the molecular function of the UNC13 protein family and their role in various disease states.
RESULTS: The UNC13 proteins have been shown to play significant roles in the progression and manifestation of several diseases. UNC13A's involvement in ALS and FTD is tied to its regulatory role in synaptic plasticity, while UNC13B has been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. UNC13C is implicated in certain cancers, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and may serve a protective role in Alzheimer's disease. UNC13D's key function in immune cell cytotoxicity places it at the center of research into familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The genetic mutations and functional dysregulation of these proteins provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of various disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The UNC13 protein family is essential to both neurological and immunological processes, and its dysregulation is linked to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Further research is needed to explore these therapeutic possibilities and to fully uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the roles of UNC13 proteins in disease.

39748852,Impacts of informant replacement in two industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.,"INTRODUCTION: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, participants must enroll with a study partner informant who completes validated study instruments. We hypothesized that mid-trial informant replacement impacts study data in industry-sponsored trials.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of two industry-sponsored AD clinical trials testing semagacestat in mild-to-moderate AD dementia. We assessed the relationships between informant replacement and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scores. Using generalized estimating equations, we assessed bias and variability using mean (bias) and mean absolute (variance) change in ADCS-ADL between successive visits as outcomes. Both models adjusted for a priori-specified potential confounding variables including participant sex, age, informant type, trial, time, previous ADCS-ADL score, and region. To analyze the impact on end-of-study change-from-baseline results, we used an analysis of covariance model to estimate the association between replacement and end-of-study change-from-baseline in ADCS-ADL, in which we adjusted for participant sex, age, informant type, trial, baseline measurement, and region. We conducted an F-test to compare the variances of this change.
RESULTS: Among N = 2637 randomized participants, 69 participants (2.6%) experienced 78 occurrences of replacement. For visits standardized to be 3 months apart, the difference in mean between-visit change in ADCS-ADL was approximately -1.61 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.79, 0.57; P = 0.147), comparing participants who experienced replacement to similar participants who had stable informants. The difference in the mean between-visit absolute change was approximately 2.02 points (95% CI: 0.34, 3.70; P = 0.019). We did not estimate a statistically significant difference in end-of-study change-from-baseline (Est. = -0.70 points; 95% CI: -5.88, 4.48; P = 0.790) or a significant ratio of variances (Est. = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.67, 2.28; P = 0.600) for participants with replacement compared to those with stable informants.
DISCUSSION: Informant replacement was associated with increased between-visit variability but had limited impact on overall trial outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Informant replacement occurred in 2.6% of participants in these industry trials.Informant replacement was associated with increased variance in acute Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living reporting.Informant replacement had a limited impact on overall change-from-baseline outcomes.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39801073,Clinical validation of artificial intelligence-based single-subject morphometry without normative reference database.,"BACKGROUND: Single-subject voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a powerful technique for reader-independent detection of brain atrophy in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to support the (differential) diagnosis and staging of neurodegenerative diseases in individual patients. However, VBM is sensitive to the MRI scanner platform and details of the acquisition sequence. To mitigate this limitation, we recently proposed and technically validated a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based VBM which does not rely on a normative reference database.
OBJECTIVE: Clinical validation of CNN-based VBM.
METHODS: CNN-based VBM was compared with conventional VBM based on a mixed-scanner normative database in 227 consecutive patients (66.0 ± 9.6 years, 53.3% female) with suspected dementing neurodegenerative disease. VBM maps were interpreted visually by two experienced readers, first with respect to the presence of any neurodegenerative disease, then for the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease (AD)-typical and non-AD atrophy patterns. A Likert 6-score was used for both tasks. Simultaneously acquired positron emission tomography (PET) with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) served as reference standard.
RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant impact of the VBM method on the visual detection of any neurodegenerative disease (p < 0.001). Balanced accuracy/sensitivity/specificity were 80.4/86.3/74.5% for CNN-based VBM versus 75.7/79.5/71.8% for conventional VBM. Differentiation between AD and non-AD typical atrophy patterns did not differ between both VBM methods (p = 0.871).
CONCLUSIONS: CNN-based VBM provides clinically useful accuracy for the detection of neurodegeneration-suspect atrophy with higher sensitivity than conventional VBM with a mixed-scanner normative reference database and without compromising specificity.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39962762,Dementia prevalence within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia National Guard Health System (2015-2023): An exploratory epidemiological study.,"BackgroundDementia is recognized as one of the prevalent neurocognitive disorders among older adults in Saudi Arabia, yet research efforts on its prevalence remains limited and fragmented, making it difficult to gain a full understanding of its epidemiology.ObjectiveTo explore dementia epidemiology and associated data within the older population in the sector of National Guard Health System (NGHS), Saudi Arabia.MethodsThis was a multicenter study that utilized medical records from NGHS centers across the country. We included data from all individuals aged 50 years and older who sought medical care between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2023.ResultsNearly half of the study's participants were men (51.9%), with the majority being diagnosed between the ages of 70-79 years (38.5%) and 80-89 years (31%). Dementia was identified in 3.37% of participants. The most prevalent subtype was late-onset Alzheimer's disease (35.6%), followed by unspecified dementia (18.4%). Significant differences between genders were observed, particularly in the age at diagnosis (p = 0.003) and the prevalence of ischemic strokes as a risk factor (p < 0.001).ConclusionsIn this multicenter study utilizing the NGHS cohort, Alzheimer's disease emerged as the most prevalent subtype of dementia.

39931855,Prospective Memory in Mobile: Using Smartphone-Based Calendars to Rehabilitate Prospective Memory in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The rapid growth of mobile phone use and internet access among older adults can provide valuable opportunities for clinicians and researchers to incorporate these technologies into the memory rehabilitation of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Building on this opportunity, previous research has used smartphone calendar applications to cue prospective memory in patients with AD. However, in these studies, the calendar has been programmed to send cues only about the time of prospective events.
METHOD: We investigated the benefits of the smartphone calendar applications sending notifications about both the time and location of the prospective events. We recruited two groups. In the first group (time-and-location-cued group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications about the time and location of prospective events, while in the second group (time-cued group), we configured smartphone-based calendars to send notifications only about the time of prospective events. In both groups, we invited patients to attend three prospective events per week during a three-week period.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated fewer omissions in the time- and location-cued group than in the time-cued group.
CONCLUSION: Providing patients with AD with several contextual cues through smartphone-based calendars may result in better prospective performance than providing them with only one contextual cue.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2025
39778750,New perspectives on the glymphatic system and the relationship between glymphatic system and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are characterized by the accumulation of aggregated proteins. The glymphatic system, through its rapid exchange mechanisms between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF), facilitates the movement of metabolic substances within the brain, serving functions akin to those of the peripheral lymphatic system. This emerging waste clearance mechanism offers a novel perspective on the removal of pathological substances in ND. This article elucidates recent discoveries regarding the glymphatic system and updates relevant concepts within its model. It discusses the potential roles of the glymphatic system in ND, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and proposes the glymphatic system as a novel therapeutic target for these conditions.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39865686,"Gait, balance, and physical performance as markers of early Alzheimer's disease and related dementia risk.","BACKGROUND: Declining physical functionality is an indicator of cognitive impairment, distinguishing normal cognition (NC) from dementia. Whether this extends to pre-dementia stages is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Assess physical performance patterns, evaluate relationships with imaging biomarkers, and identify specific measures distinguishing NC, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Group differences (78 NC, 35 SCD, and 41 MCI) in physical function (global function, balance, gait speed, step length, single leg support) were evaluated with logistic regression while distinguishing between MCI due-to-AD and MCI due-to-vascular etiology. Relationships with imaging biomarkers (cortical atrophy score, white matter hyperintensities volumes) were analyzed with ANCOVA.
RESULTS: Participants were 68.6 ± 9.3 years old, had 16.2 ± 3.0 years of education, and 23% were ethnoracial minorities. Physical performance distinguished MCI from NC and SCD. Greater performance on the Mini Physical Performance Test (mini PPT) and balance were associated with lower odds of being SCD versus NC (OR<sub>mini PPT</sub> = 0.73; 95% CI:0.56-0.97; OR<sub>balance</sub> = 0.35, 95%CI:0.16-0.80). AD etiology accounted for most group differences in physical performance versus vascular etiology. Consistent associations between biomarkers, physical performance, and cognition were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that: 1) changes in mini PPT performance and balance may help detect cognitive impairments, as early as the SCD stage; 2) changes in gait speed, gait cycle parameters, and Timed Up-and-Go may indicate more significant cognitive impairment; 3) neuronal loss is linked to subtle changes in physical functionality as early as SCD. Physical performance may be a valuable tool in early dementia detection in clinical settings and could identify targets for early intervention.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39732953,Enhancing early detection of Alzheimer's disease through hybrid models based on feature fusion of multi-CNN and handcrafted features.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disorder that causes memory loss and behavioral and thinking problems. The symptoms of Alzheimer's are similar throughout its development stages, which makes it difficult to diagnose manually. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques address the limitations of manual diagnosis. In this study, the images were enhanced and the active contour algorithm (ACA) was used to extract regions of interest (ROI) such as soft tissue and white matter. Strategies have been developed to diagnose AD and differentiate its stages. The first strategy is using XGBoost and ANN networks with the features of MobileNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet models. The second strategy is by XGBoost and ANN networks with combined features of MobileNet-DenseNet121, DenseNet121-GoogLeNet and MobileNet-GoogLeNet. The third strategy combines XGBoost and ANN networks with combined features of MobileNet-DenseNet121-Handcrafted, DenseNet121-GoogLeNet-Handcrafted, and MobileNet-GoogLeNet-Handcrafted leading to improved accuracy of the strategies and improved efficiency. XGBoost with hybrid features of DenseNet-GoogLeNet-Handcrafted achieved an AUC of 98.82%, accuracy of 98.8%, sensitivity of 98.9%, accuracy of 97.08%, and specificity of 99.5%.",Sci Rep,2024
40044591,Diagnostic Challenge in Frontal Variant Alzheimer's Disease With Low Amyloid-β PET Retention.,"Diagnosing frontal variant Alzheimer's disease (fvAD) is difficult and could be even more difficult when amyloid-beta (Aβ) PET retention is low. A 63-year-old woman presenting with a 3-year history of apathy and memory impairment showed executive dysfunction, memory impairment, and severe bilateral frontotemporal atrophy on MRI. Aβ PET showed only equivocal findings in the right frontal lobe and was negative. However, CSF showed a severely decreased Aβ42/40 ratio and increased phospho-tau181. AD-tau-specific (18F)-MK6240 PET revealed increased tracer retention predominantly in the bilateral frontal lobes, confirming the fvAD diagnosis. (18F)-MK6240 PET can be valuable in resolving diagnostic uncertainties in atypical patients with low Aβ retention.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2025
39953283,Gait impairment associated with neuroimaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,"Research links gait impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to cognitive abnormalities, brain atrophy, or amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, with the exact cause unclear. This study investigated the relationship between gait, neuroimaging biomarkers, and cognition across the AD spectrum. We recruited 48 AD dementia patients, 27 with prodromal AD, and 41 cognitively unimpaired individuals, analyzing associations among gait parameters, cognitive scores, Aβ deposition, and cortical atrophy. Path and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated gait impairment's interdependent interactions and diagnostic potential. Prodromal AD and AD dementia patients showed significantly slower gait pace than CU (p = 0.014 [velocity], p = 0.003 [step length]), linked to attention and executive functions, widespread Aβ deposition, and cortical atrophy, in the inferior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, and insula. Compared to CU, AD dementia patients exhibited greater gait variability and phase (p = 0.017 [step length standard deviation], p = 0.001 [double support percentage]), significantly correlated with cognition and Aβ deposition. Path analysis revealed a combined influence of Aβ deposition, cognitive impairment, and cortical atrophy on gait impairment, with > 80% observed gait impairments directly affected by Aβ deposition. ROC curves for diagnosing AD stages showed significant areas under the curve, suggesting gait characteristics as noninvasive biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and progression monitoring.",Sci Rep,2025
39892386,Loss of endothelial CD2AP causes sex-dependent cerebrovascular dysfunction.,"Polymorphisms in CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) predispose to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that loss of CD2AP in cerebral blood vessels is associated with cognitive decline in AD subjects and that genetic downregulation of CD2AP in brain vascular endothelial cells impairs memory function in male mice. Animals with reduced brain endothelial CD2AP display altered blood flow regulation at rest and during neurovascular coupling, defects in mural cell activity, and an abnormal vascular sex-dependent response to Aβ. Antagonizing endothelin-1 receptor A signaling partly rescues the vascular impairments, but only in male mice. Treatment of CD2AP mutant mice with reelin glycoprotein that mitigates the effects of CD2AP loss function via ApoER2 increases resting cerebral blood flow and even protects male mice against the noxious effect of Aβ. Thus, endothelial CD2AP plays critical roles in cerebrovascular functions and represents a novel target for sex-specific treatment in AD.",Neuron,2025
40189832,Trends in the use of advance care planning and cognitive assessment and care planning service visits: moving toward a palliative-informed approach for ambulatory care of community-dwelling persons with dementia and their caregivers.,"INTRODUCTION: Both the advance care planning (ACP) visit and cognitive assessment and care planning service (CAACPS) visit offer palliative-oriented care for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, the rate of ACP visits remains low, and little has been reported regarding CAACPS visits. Furthermore, few reports describe use of either visit among Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries. This study describes provision of ACP and CAACPS visits to community-dwelling older adult MA beneficiaries with ADRD.
METHODS: Using deidentified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart claims data, we evaluated ambulatory care visits for community-dwelling older adult MA beneficiaries with ADRD for the years 2018 to 2019.
RESULTS: For 2018 and 2019, 3.5% and 5.4% received ACP visits, and 0.4% and 0.5% received CAACPS visits, similar to use reported elsewhere.
DISCUSSION: Few MA beneficiaries with ADRD received ACP or CAACPS visits, and the delivery of CAACPs visits is similar to that reported for non-MA beneficiaries.
HIGHLIGHTS: Most persons with dementia are community-dwelling and disproportionately disadvantaged. Access to palliative care is limited for community-dwelling persons with dementia. CAACPS visits may address this gap. Our findings show the use of CAACPS visits is very low.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39935889,Cognitive markers for the distinction between asymptomatic and prodromal Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome: Correlations with volumetric brain changes.,"INTRODUCTION: Motivated by the difficulties in detecting cognitive deterioration in the context of Down syndrome (DS), we aimed to identify markers of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) in this population.
METHODS: Sixty-two participants with DS (age &gt; 45) distributed in three groups (asymptomatic [A<sub>DS</sub>], prodromal [P<sub>DS</sub>], and dementia [D<sub>DS</sub>]) completed the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with Down's Syndrome and Others with Intellectual Disabilities, Cambridge Cognitive Examination for older adults with Down's Syndrome, and Barcelona Test for Intellectual Disability tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan.
RESULTS: Although temporal orientation showed significant differences among groups, only a predictive diagnostic model based on verbal short-term memory tasks (relying on ""cued"" recall) allowed the correct classification of 88.5% of A<sub>DS</sub>, 75.0% of P<sub>DS</sub>, and 95% of D<sub>DS</sub> individuals. Cognitive decline strongly correlated with brain volume reductions in orbitofrontal, medial-temporal, and bilateral thalamus within the D<sub>DS</sub> group.
DISCUSSION: Neuropsychological results showed that P<sub>DS</sub> cases were characterized by a significant deterioration of verbal memory and temporal orientation, compared to A<sub>DS</sub>. This pattern might be crucial to support diagnosis in clinical settings.Highlights: Detecting signs of prodromal dementia is a major challenge in Down syndrome.Such challenge is due to a poor definition of the early cognitive manifestations.Memory tasks relying on ""cued"" recall allowed the detection of prodromal cases.A pattern of temporal disorientation was also evident in the prodromal phase.These cognitive deficits preceded volumetric brain changes only present in dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39695746,Mystery of gamma wave stimulation in brain disorders.,"Neuronal oscillations refer to rhythmic and periodic fluctuations of electrical activity in the central nervous system that arise from the cellular properties of diverse neuronal populations and their interactions. Specifically, gamma oscillations play a crucial role in governing the connectivity between distinct brain regions, which are essential in perception, motor control, memory, and emotions. In this context, we recapitulate various current stimulation methods to induce gamma entrainment. These methods include sensory stimulation, optogenetic modulation, photobiomodulation, and transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation. Simultaneously, we explore the association between abnormal gamma oscillations and central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. Evidence suggests that gamma entrainment-inducing stimulation methods offer notable neuroprotection, although somewhat controversial. This review comprehensively discusses the functional role of gamma oscillations in higher-order brain activities from both physiological and pathological perspectives, emphasizing gamma entrainment as a potential therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in implementing such strategies.",Mol Neurodegener,2024
39820097,Screening of Aβ and phosphorylated tau status in the cerebrospinal fluid through machine learning analysis of portable electroencephalography data.,"Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) through pathological markers is typically costly and invasive. This study aims to find a noninvasive, cost-effective method using portable electroencephalography (EEG) to detect changes in AD-related biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 102 patients, both with and without AD-related biomarker changes (amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau), were recorded using a 2-minute resting-state portable EEG. A machine-learning algorithm then analyzed the EEG data to identify these biomarker changes. The results showed that the machine learning model could distinguish patients with AD-related biomarker changes, achieving 68.1% accuracy (AUROC 0.75) for amyloid beta and 71.2% accuracy (AUROC 0.77) for phosphorylated tau, with gamma activities being key features. When excluding cases with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, accuracy improved to 74.1% (AUROC 0.80) for amyloid beta and 73.1% (AUROC 0.80) for phosphorylated tau. This study suggests that portable EEG combined with machine learning is a promising noninvasive and cost-effective tool for early AD-related pathological marker screening, which could enhance neurophysiological understanding and diagnostic accessibility.",Sci Rep,2025
39989617,"Predicting the impact of missense mutations on an unresolved protein's stability, structure, and function: A case study of Alzheimer's disease-associated TREM2 R47H variant.","AlphaFold2 (AF2) has spurred a revolution in predicting unresolved structures of wild-type proteins with high accuracy. However, AF2 falls short of predicting the effects of missense mutations on unresolved protein structures that may be informative to efforts in personalized medicine. Over the last decade, countless in-silico methods have been developed to predict the pathogenicity of point mutations on resolved structures, but no studies have evaluated their capabilities on unresolved protein structures predicted by AF2. Herein, we investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-causing coding variants of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) receptor using in-silico mutagenesis techniques on the AF2-predicted structure. We first demonstrated that the predicted structure retained a high accuracy in critical regions of the extracellular domain and subsequently validated the in-silico mutagenesis methods by evaluating the effects of the strongest risk variant R47H of TREM2. After validation of the R47H variant, we predicted the molecular basis and effects on protein stability and ligand-binding affinity of the R62H and D87N variants that remain unknown in current literature. By comparing it with the R47H variant, our analysis reveals that R62H and D87N variants exert a much less pronounced effect on the structural stability of TREM2. These in-silico findings show the possibility that the R62H and D87N mutations are likely less pathogenic than the R47H AD. Lastly, we investigated the Nasu-Hakola (NHD)-causing Y38C and V126G TREM2 as a comparison and found that they imposed greater destabilization compared to AD-causing variants. We believe that the in-silico mutagenesis methods described here can be applied broadly to evaluate the ever-growing numbers of protein mutations/variants discovered in human genetics study for their potential in diseases, ultimately facilitating personalized medicine.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,2025

39686920,Examining vaccination-related adverse events in frequent neurodegenerative diseases.,"This study investigates adverse events following vaccination in patients with four neurodegenerative diseases: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease. We applied advanced data processing techniques to analyze symptom patterns and severity scores across these disease groups. Patients were identified through filtering, and symptom clusters were extracted to group similar symptoms into distinct clusters, and severity scores were computed based on hospitalization and death reports. A chi-squared test was performed to assess the statistical significance of adverse event distributions among the diseases for different vaccines. The results reveal that ALS patients exhibit severe respiratory symptoms post-vaccination, while Alzheimer's patients report significant respiratory and gastrointestinal issues. MS patients commonly experience general symptoms such as fatigue, while Parkinson's patients face exacerbated motor symptoms. Notably, our analysis showed no significant difference in adverse event reporting rates between COVID-19 and pneumococcal vaccines across these disease groups. This research provides new insights into disease-specific responses to vaccines, emphasizing the importance of personalized monitoring and treatment strategies to mitigate risks and improve clinical outcomes in these vulnerable populations.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2025
39956977,Androgen deprivation therapy and dementia risk: An updated and dose-response meta-analysis.,"BackgroundThe association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and dementia risk is controversial, and the dose-response relationship between them remains unclear.ObjectiveWe aim to further clarify the relationship between ADT and dementia risk.MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched up to September 2024 to identify relevant studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as pooled indicators. The robust error meta-regression (REMR) approach was performed to explore the dose-response relationship. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics, and subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regressions were conducted. Publication bias was evaluated with a funnel plot and Egger's test.ResultsOur meta-analysis of 21 studies involving 2,278,835 patients revealed that ADT significantly increased the risk of overall dementia (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.23), but not non-AD dementia (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.89-1.16). For ADT subtypes, anti-androgens increased the risk of overall dementia (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.49), particularly for AD (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19-1.97), while Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy and bilateral orchiectomy were not linked to the risk of any dementia subtype. A bell-shaped non-linear relationship between ADT duration and dementia risk was observed, with the highest risk observed at 15.5 to 21.5 months (HR = 1.25), which was confirmed by subgroup analysis for AD.ConclusionsThe risk of overall dementia and AD were found to be significantly associated with ADT in a bell-shaped dose-response effect.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39994996,Regulation of glial ApoE secretion by the mevalonate pathway is independent of ApoE isoform.,"BackgroundLipids synthesized in astrocytes are distributed to other brain cells in high-density lipoprotein-like ApoE particles. ApoE, which is a powerful genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease, is secreted differently depending on genotype. Secretion of ApoE from mouse astrocytes is regulated by the mevalonate pathway.ObjectiveWe aimed to understand if the regulation of ApoE secretion from astrocytes by the mevalonate pathway was the same between mouse ApoE and ApoE from humanized mice, and if this is impacted by ApoE isoform.MethodsAstrocyte-enriched glial cultures from wild-type and humanized ApoE targeted-replacement mice were treated with pharmacological inhibitors of various steps along the mevalonate pathway and ApoE in the conditioned media was measured.ResultsWe show that statins and prenylation inhibitors, but not specific cholesterol inhibitors, reduce extracellular ApoE lipoparticle levels in astrocyte-enriched glial cultures, and that this occurs in cells harboring either the mouse ApoE or any of the three human ApoE genotypes to a similar extent. We find that geranylgeranylation modulates ApoE release from astrocytes, and it does so independent of ApoE genotype.ConclusionsOur results suggest that prenylation broadly regulates ApoE secretion from astrocytes regardless of ApoE genotype, and that this is mediated specifically by geranylgeranylation. Therefore, our data implicates geranylgeranylation as a general mechanism modulating ApoE release from astrocytes, but likely is not responsible for the reported baseline differences in ApoE secretion seen in vivo and in vitro across genotypes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39929889,Sigma-2 receptor modulator CT1812 alters key pathways and rescues retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) functional deficits associated with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).,"Trafficking defects in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells contribute to RPE atrophy, a hallmark of geographic atrophy (GA) in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Dry AMD pathogenesis is multifactorial, including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and oxidative stress-common features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Sigma-2 receptor (S2R) regulates lipid and protein trafficking, and S2R modulators reverse trafficking deficits in neurodegeneration in vitro models. Given overlapping mechanisms contributing to AD and AMD, S2R modulator effects on RPE function were investigated. The S2R modulator CT1812 is in clinical trials for AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and GA. Leveraging AD trials testing CT1812, unbiased analyses of patient biofluid proteomes revealed that proteins altered by CT1812 associated with GA and macular degeneration disease ontologies and overlapped with proteins altered in dry AMD. Differential expression analysis of RPE transcripts from APP-Swedish/London mutant transgenic mice, a model featuring Aβ accumulation, revealed reversal of autophagy/trafficking transcripts in S2R modulator-treated animals versus vehicle toward healthy control levels. Photoreceptor outer segment (POS) trafficking in human RPE cells showed deficits in response to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> or hydrogen peroxide compared to vehicle. S2R modulators normalized stressor-induced POS trafficking deficits, resembling healthy control. Taken together, S2R modulation may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for dry AMD.",Sci Rep,2025
40183375,The Alzheimer's Disease Gene SORL1 Regulates Lysosome Function in Human Microglia.,"The SORL1 gene encodes the sortilin-related receptor protein SORLA, a sorting receptor that regulates endo-lysosomal trafficking of various substrates. Loss of function variants in SORL1 are causative for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and decreased expression of SORLA has been repeatedly observed in human AD brains. SORL1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including in microglia, the tissue-resident immune cells of the brain. Loss of SORLA leads to enlarged lysosomes in hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (hMGLs). However, how SORLA deficiency contributes to lysosomal dysfunction in microglia and how this contributes to AD pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we show that loss of SORLA results in decreased lysosomal degradation and lysosomal enzyme activity due to altered trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in hMGLs. Phagocytic uptake of fibrillar amyloid beta 1-42 and synaptosomes is increased in SORLA-deficient hMGLs, but due to reduced lysosomal degradation, these substrates aberrantly accumulate in lysosomes. An alternative mechanism of lysosome clearance, lysosomal exocytosis, is also impaired in SORL1-deficient microglia, which may contribute to an altered immune response. Overall, these data suggest that SORLA has an important role in the proper trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases in hMGLs, which is critical for microglial function. This further substantiates the microglial endo-lysosomal network as a potential novel pathway through which SORL1 may increase AD risk and contribute to the development of AD. Additionally, our findings may inform the development of novel lysosome and microglia-associated drug targets for AD.",Glia,2025
39748849,Plasma amyloid beta biomarkers predict amyloid positivity and longitudinal clinical progression in mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have examined the predictive accuracy of plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers in clinical cohorts. However, their accuracy for predicting amyloid-positive patients in community-based cohorts is unclear. This study aimed to determine the predictive accuracy of Aβ precursor protein 669-711/Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40/1-42 and their composite biomarkers for brain amyloid deposition or the clinical progression in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted from August 2015 to September 2019. Subsequently, the participants underwent follow-up cognitive assessments up to 8 years after the start of the study. Blood samples were collected from older adults aged ≥ 65 years with MCI at baseline. Plasma Aβ biomarkers were analyzed using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. The accuracy of plasma biomarkers for brain amyloid status was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Relationships between comorbidities and plasma Aβ markers were examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Associations of plasma biomarkers with clinical conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were evaluated using Kaplan‒Meier curves.
RESULTS: The participants included 107 patients (57 [53.3%] females, median age: 76.0 [72.0-80.0] years). Plasma biomarkers correlated with cortical amyloid uptake (ρ = 0.667-0.754). The composite biomarker had the best area under the curve (0.943, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.901 to 0.985) for predicting amyloid positivity. Apolipoprotein ε4 status showed significant correlations with increased plasma amyloid biomarker levels. Participants with high composite biomarker levels at baseline had a greater risk of conversion to AD dementia (hazard ratio 10.74, 95% CI: 3.51 to 32.84, P &lt; 0.001). The higher composite biomarker was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline (ρ = -0.575, P &lt; 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Plasma Aβ composite biomarker may serve as a surrogate measure for amyloid deposition and a predictor of disease progression in a community-based cohort.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) biomarkers correlated with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B uptake, mainly in the frontal/parietotemporal cortices and posterior cingulate gyrus.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict amyloid positron emission tomography positivity with a high area under the curve of 0.943 in a community-based mild cognitive impairment cohort.The higher amyloid composite biomarker at baseline was significantly associated with worsening Mini-Mental State Examination score and a high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia over 8 years.The amyloid composite biomarker can predict clinical progression to AD dementia with a high area under the curve of 0.860.Apolipoprotein E ε4 status influenced the plasma Aβ biomarker levels.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40037332,Mendelian randomization identifies proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Proteins are involved in multiple biological functions. High-throughput technologies have allowed the measurement of thousands of proteins in population biobanks. In this study, we aimed to identify proteins related to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by leveraging large-scale genetic and proteomic data. We performed a two-sample cis Mendelian randomization study by selecting instrumental variables for the abundance of >2700 proteins measured by either Olink or SomaScan platforms in plasma from the UK Biobank and the deCODE Health Study. We also used the latest publicly available genome-wide association studies for the neurodegenerative diseases of interest. The potentially causal effect of proteins on neurodegenerative diseases was estimated based on the Wald ratio. We tested 13 377 protein-disease associations, identifying 169 associations that were statistically significant (5% false discovery rate). Evidence of co-localization between plasma protein abundance and disease risk (posterior probability > 0.80) was identified for 61 protein-disease pairs, leading to 50 unique protein-disease associations. Notably, 23 of 50 protein-disease associations corresponded to genetic loci not previously reported by genome-wide association studies. The two-sample Mendelian randomization and co-localization analysis also showed that APOE abundance in plasma was associated with three subcortical volumes (hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens) and white matter hyper-intensities, whereas PILRA and PILRB abundance in plasma was associated with caudate nucleus volume. Our study provided a comprehensive assessment of the effect of the human proteome that is currently measurable through two different platforms on neurodegenerative diseases. The newly associated proteins indicated the involvement of complement (C1S and C1R), microglia (SIRPA, SIGLEC9 and PRSS8) and lysosomes (CLN5) in Alzheimer's disease; the interleukin-6 pathway (CTF1) in Parkinson's disease; lysosomes (TPP1), blood-brain barrier integrity (MFAP2) and astrocytes (TNFSF13) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and blood-brain barrier integrity (VEGFB), oligodendrocytes (PARP1), node of Ranvier and dorsal root ganglion (NCS1, FLRT3 and CDH15) and the innate immune system (CR1, AHSG and WARS) in multiple sclerosis. Our study demonstrates how harnessing large-scale genomic and proteomic data can yield new insights into the role of the plasma proteome in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.",Brain,2025
39695324,Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons: new perspectives of treatment and future challenges in dementia.,"Central nervous system parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) are crucial and highly vulnerable to various stressors. They also play a significant role in the pathological processes of many neuropsychiatric diseases, especially those associated with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), Lewy body dementia, and schizophrenia. Although accumulating evidence suggests that the loss of PV-INs is associated with memory impairment in dementia, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this review, we delve into the current evidence regarding the physiological properties of PV-INs and summarize the latest insights into how their loss contributes to cognitive decline in dementia, particularly focusing on AD and VD. Additionally, we discuss the influence of PV-INs on brain development, the variations in their characteristics across different types of dementia, and how their loss affects the etiology and progression of cognitive impairments. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of PV-INs and to consider their potential as novel therapeutic targets in dementia treatment.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40002846,Neuroprotective Effects of Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate Against Aβ Toxicity and Accumulation in Cellular and Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background/Objectives: Beneficial effects of neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) on cognition, emotions and behavior have been previously reported, suggesting its potential in the prevention and treatment of various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective actions of DHEAS against Aβ toxicity in both cellular and animal models of AD. Methods: After optimizing the AD model in vitro, we investigated the DHEAS effects on the viability and death of primary mouse neurons exposed to toxic Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers for 24 h. In order to extend our research to an in vivo study, we further tested the acute effects of intraperitoneal DHEAS administration on the Aβ plaque density in different brain regions of 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD. Results: In cell culture, DHEAS hampered the decrease in the neuronal viability caused by toxic Aβ oligomers, primarily by influencing mitochondrial function and apoptosis. DHEAS also counteracted the increase in the mRNA expression of selected genes (PI3K, Akt, Bcl2, Bax), induced in neuronal culture by treatment with Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers. Obtained data suggested the involvement of mitochondria, caspases 3 and 7, as well as the PI3K/Akt and Bcl2 signaling network in the antiapoptotic properties of DHEAS in neurons. Forty-eight hours after DHEAS treatment, a significantly lower number of Aβ plaques was observed in the motor cortex but not in other brain areas of 3xTg-AD mice. Conclusions: Results indicated potential neuroprotective effects of DHEAS against Aβ toxicity and accumulation, suggesting that DHEAS supplementation should be further studied as a novel option for AD prevention and/or treatment.",Biomedicines,2025

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the potential of blood phosphorylated Tau181 (p-tau181) to differentiate amyloid-positive (A+) and amyloid-negative (A-) subjects. Two meta-analyses were conducted, showing the mean p-tau values in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the A+ and A- group, and the second comparing the mean p-tau concentrations in blood and CSF among A+ versus A- participants, by laboratory assessment method.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies (2764 A+ and 5646 A- subjects) were included. The single-group meta-analysis showed mean higher blood p-tau181 values in the A+ than in the A- group. In the head-to-head meta-analysis, blood p-tau reliably differentiated A+ patients from A- participants.
DISCUSSION: Regardless of the laboratory technique, blood p-tau181 reliably differentiates A+ and A- subjects. Therefore, it might have important applications for early diagnosis and inclusion in clinical trials for AD patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: The role of blood-based biomarkers in discriminating AD patients is still uncertain.Blood p-tau181 distinguishes among amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative subjects.Blood p-tau181 might allow early diagnosis and inclusion in clinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39801050,Cross-sectional and prognostic associations of baseline [<sup>18</sup>F]GTP1 tau PET signal and white matter lesion volumes for cognitive and functional decline in prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau and white matter lesion pathology are associated with clinical severity and subsequent decline, but their relative relationships with clinical assessments remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To examine cross-sectional and prognostic associations between baseline [<sup>18</sup>F]GTP1 tau positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVRs) and T1 white matter hypointensity (WMHypo) volumes with clinical indices.
METHODS: We analyzed participants with biomarker-confirmed prodromal (n = 127) or mild (n = 233) AD with baseline [<sup>18</sup>F]GTP1 tau PET and MRI and longitudinal Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), 13-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) data.
RESULTS: Higher baseline [<sup>18</sup>F]GTP1 SUVRs were independently associated with poorer baseline performance and faster rates of subsequent decline on all five clinical outcome measures. Higher baseline WMHypo volumes were independently associated with poorer baseline performance on the CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog13, RBANS, and MMSE and faster rates of subsequent decline on the CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL.
CONCLUSIONS: The independent associations of tau and white matter lesion pathology with clinical decline in AD suggest future prognostic models should include both imaging modalities.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40161217,"Unravelling pathological ageing with brain age gap estimation in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and schizophrenia.","Brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE), the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age, might be a putative biomarker aiming to detect the transition from healthy to pathological brain ageing. The biomarker primarily models healthy ageing with machine learning models trained with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. BrainAGE is expected to translate the deviations in neural ageing trajectory and has been shown to be increased in multiple pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Thus, accelerated ageing seems to be a general feature of neuropathological processes. However, neurobiological constraints remain to be identified to provide specificity to this biomarker. Explainability might be the key to uncovering age predictions and understanding which brain regions lead to an elevated predicted age on a given pathology compared to healthy controls. This is highly relevant to understanding the similarities and differences in neurodegeneration in AD and T2D, which remains an outstanding biological question. Sensitivity maps explain models by computing the importance of each voxel on the final prediction, thereby contributing to the interpretability of deep learning approaches. This paper assesses whether sensitivity maps yield different results across three conditions related to pathological neural ageing: AD, schizophrenia and T2D. Five deep learning models were considered, each model trained with different MRI data types: minimally processed T<sub>1</sub>-weighted brain scans, and corresponding grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid tissue segmentation and deformation fields (after spatial normalization). Our results revealed an increased BrainAGE in all pathologies, with a different mean, which is the smallest in schizophrenia; this is in line with the observation that neural loss is secondary in this early-onset condition. Importantly, our findings suggest that the sensitivity, indexing regional weights, for all models varies with age. A set of regions were shown to yield statistical differences across conditions. These sensitivity results suggest that mechanisms of neurodegeneration are quite distinct in AD and T2D. For further validation, the sensitivity and the morphometric maps were compared. The findings outlined a high congruence between the sensitivity and morphometry maps for age and clinical group conditions. Our evidence outlines that the biological explanation of model predictions is vital in adding specificity to the BrainAGE and understanding the pathophysiology of chronic conditions affecting the brain.",Brain Commun,2025
39748835,Application of the revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Drug development and clinical practice.,"UNLABELLED: The newly proposed revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the Alzheimer's Association (AA) Workgroup represent a significant milestone in the field. These criteria offer objective measures for diagnosing and staging biological AD, bridging the gap between research and clinical care. Although implementation feasibility may vary across regions and settings, improving the availability and accuracy of biomarkers, especially plasma biomarkers, is expected to enhance the applicability of these criteria in clinical practice. The Fall 2023 Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting served as a forum for gathering industry perspectives and feedback on these revised criteria, ensuring that the new criteria inform research, clinical trial design, and clinical care. In this article, we outline a summary of the newly proposed ""Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of AD: AA Workgroup"" and provide highlights from the AARR meeting in fall 2023.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from industry, academia, and government, to review the Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of AD: AA Workgroup, and gather industry perspectives and feedback on these revised criteria before its publication.The newly proposed revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the AA's Workgroup represent a significant milestone, offering objective measures for the biological and staging of AD and bridging the gap between research and clinical care.Improving the availability and accuracy of biomarkers, especially blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) is expected to improve clinical research and enhance the applicability of these criteria in clinical practice.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39686609,"Apolipoprotein (APOA1, APOE, CLU) genes expression in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in an ischemic model of Alzheimer's disease with survival up to 2 years.","BACKGROUND: Changes in the Alzheimer's disease-related apolipoprotein genes expression, occurring parallel with brain ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA3 area, may be crucial for the development of memory loss and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate changes in genes expression of apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and clusterin (CLU) in CA3 area post-ischemia with survival of 2 years.
METHODS: The gene expression was evaluated with the use of an RT-PCR protocol after 2, 7, and 30 days and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-ischemia.
RESULTS: The expression of the APOA1 gene (encoding apolipoprotein A1) was below the control values at 2 days, 6 and 12 months while at 7 and 30 days and 18 and 24 months post-ischemia this gene expression exceeded the control values. In the case of the CLU gene (encoding clusterin) expression, it was above the control values at all times post-ischemia. Similar expression was observed for the APOE gene (encoding apolipoprotein E) except on day 7 after ischemia where its expression was below the control value.
CONCLUSIONS: The results seem to indicate that the observed changes in the gene expression may reflect the activation and inhibition of a variety of processes involved in ischemia-induced neurodegeneration. The enhanced expression of APOA1 and CLU genes may be associated with induction of neuroprotective mechanisms while increased expression of the APOE gene may produce detrimental effects.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40091571,The management of mild neurocognitive disorder in primary care: A Delphi consensus study.,"BackgroundStrategies to identify and treat mild neurocognitive disorder (mild NCD) are still unclear.ObjectiveThe detection and management of mild NCD are crucial to prevent or delay its progression to major NCD, and to help those affected cope with cognitive impairment. The Cartesio Project aimed to reach a consensus on the management of mild NCD in primary care.MethodsThe Advisory Board of five experts (three neurologists, one geriatrician and one general practitioner (GP)), identified four domains of mild NCD: case finding; differential diagnosis; non-pharmacological, and pharmacological intervention. A literature review was performed by consulting the PubMed, PsycNET and Scopus databases from 2017 until August 2022, and guidelines, reviews and meta-analyses on mild NCD were reviewed. A care pathway involving 18 statements was then proposed and voted on by 61 participants (39% neurologists, 31% geriatricians, 25% GPs and 5% psychiatrists).ResultsAgreement was reached on 14 out of 18 statements. The practice of case finding in primary care and the need for a two-level diagnostic approach was supported, including referral to memory clinics. With regard to non-pharmacological treatments, no consensus was reached on nutritional supplementation. There was support for the use of nootropic drug treatments, but not for drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.ConclusionsThe Cartesio Project developed a consensus to identify the best care for mild NCD. The consensus highlights educational interventions on timely detection and appropriate management of mild NCD in primary care, which may be of relevance for those patients who eventually develop Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39868465,Compositional brain scores capture Alzheimer's disease-specific structural brain patterns along the disease continuum.,"INTRODUCTION: Traditional multivariate methods for neuroimaging studies overlook the interdependent relationship between brain features. This study addresses this gap by analyzing relative brain volumetric patterns to capture how Alzheimer's disease (AD) and genetics influence brain structure along the disease continuum.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from participants across the AD continuum from the Alzheimer's and Families (ALFA) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies. Compositional data analysis (CoDA) was exploited to examine relative brain volumetric variations that (1) were linked to different AD stages compared to cognitively unimpaired amyloid-β-negative (CU A-) individuals and (2) varied by AD genetic risk.
RESULTS: Disease stage-specific compositional brain scores were identified, differentiating CU A- individuals from those in more advanced stages. Genetic risk-stratified models revealed a broader genetic landscape affecting brain morphology in AD, beyond the well-known apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.
DISCUSSION: CoDA emerges as an alternative multivariate framework to deepen understanding of AD-related structural changes and support targeted interventions for those at higher genetic risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: Compositional data analysis (CoDA) revealed the relative variation of brain region volumes, captured in compositional brain scores, capable of discerning between cognitively unimpaired amyloid-β-negative individuals and subjects within other disease-stage groups along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. CoDA also uncovered the genetic vulnerability of specific brain regions at each stage of the disease along the continuum. CoDA is capable of integrating magnetic resonance imaging data from two different cohorts without stringent requirements for harmonization. This translates as an advantage, compared to traditional methods, and strengthens the reliability of cross-study comparisons by standardizing the data despite different labeling agreements, facilitating collaborative and large-scale research. The algorithm is sensitive to AD-specific effects, as the main compositional brain scores display little overlap with the age-specific compositional brain score. CoDA provides a more accurate analysis of brain imaging data addressing its compositional nature, which can influence the development of targeted approaches, opening new avenues for enhancing brain health.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

39766465,Artificial Intelligence-Based Methodologies for Early Diagnostic Precision and Personalized Therapeutic Strategies in Neuro-Ophthalmic and Neurodegenerative Pathologies.,"Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques-Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging-in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to maximize their clinical impact.",Brain Sci,2024
39732800,Identification of RN7SK LncRNA as a novel biomarker in Alzheimer's disease using bioinformatics and expression analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative illness that accounts for the common type of dementia among adults over the age of 65. Despite extensive studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, early diagnosis of AD is still debatable. In this research, we performed bioinformatics approaches on the AD-related E-MTAB 6094 dataset to uncover new potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis. To achieve this, we performed in-depth in silico assays, including differentially expressed genes analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analyses, module-trait association analyses, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and hub genes network analyses. Finally, the expression of the identified candidate genes was evaluated in AD patients PBMC samples by qRT-PCR. Through computational analyses, we found that RN7SK LncRNA and its co-expressed genes of TNF, TNFAIP3, CCLT3, and FLT3 are from key genes in AD development that are associated with inflammatory responses. Our experimental validation revealed that RN7SK LncRNA and TNF were substantially up-regulated in AD samples (P = 0.006 and P = 0.023, respectively). Whereas, TNFAIP3 expression was significantly decreased (P = 0.016). However, the expression of CCL3 and FLT3 did not differ significantly between two groups (P = 0.396 and P = 0.521, respectively). In conclusion, in this study a novel LncRNA associated with AD pathogenesis were identified, which may provide new diagnostic biomarker for AD.",Sci Rep,2024
39820004,The Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) unravels changes in disease-associated microglia subsets across neurodegenerative conditions.,"Dysregulated microglia activation, leading to neuroinflammation, is crucial in neurodegenerative disease development and progression. We constructed an atlas of human brain immune cells by integrating nineteen single-nucleus RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq datasets from multiple neurodegenerative conditions, comprising 241 samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Lewy body diseases, COVID-19, and healthy controls. The integrated Human Microglia Atlas (HuMicA) included 90,716 nuclei/cells and revealed nine populations distributed across all conditions. We identified four subtypes of disease-associated microglia and disease-inflammatory macrophages, recently described in mice, and shown here to be prevalent in human tissue. The high versatility of microglia is evident through changes in subset distribution across various pathologies, suggesting their contribution in shaping pathological phenotypes. A GPNMB-high subpopulation was expanded in AD and MS. In situ hybridization corroborated this increase in AD, opening the question on the relevance of this population in other pathologies.",Nat Commun,2025
39989007,Tau-related reduction of glucose metabolism in mild cognitive impairment occurs independently of APOE ε4 genotype and is influenced by Aβ.,"INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have shown that amyloid beta (Aβ) is significantly correlated with glucose metabolism in mild cognitive impairment independently of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype.
METHODS: We used a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach to pairwise cross-correlation among tau, Aβ, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET images. The resulting SVD-based tau and Aβ scores as well as the APOE ε4 genotype, were entered as predictors in a voxelwise general linear model for statistical assessment of their effect on FDG.
RESULTS: We found cortical regions where a reduced glucose metabolism was maximally correlated with distributed patterns of tau, accounting for the effect of Aβ and APOE ε4 genotype.
DISCUSSION: By highlighting the more significant role of tau, rather than Aβ, in the reduction of glucose metabolism, our results provide a better understanding of their combined effect in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study uses a data-driven singular value decomposition approach to the cross-correlation matrix between tau and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images, as well as between FDG and amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) images. From a population of mild cognitive impairment subjects, we found that spatially distributed scores of tau PET are associated with an even stronger reduction of glucose metabolism, independent of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype and confounded by Aβ. By highlighting the more significant role of tau, rather than Aβ, on the reduction of glucose metabolism, our results provide a better understanding of their combined effects in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39737748,Sex-dependent molecular landscape of Alzheimer's disease revealed by large-scale single-cell transcriptomics.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows significant sex differences in prevalence and clinical manifestations, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: This study used a large-scale, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human prefrontal cortex to investigate sex-dependent molecular changes in AD. Our approach combined cell type-specific and sex-specific differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment, gene regulatory network construction, and cell-cell communication analysis to identify sex-dependent changes.
RESULTS: We found significant sex-specific gene expression patterns and pathway alterations in AD. Male astrocytes showed changes in cell death pathways, with RPTOR as a key regulator, while female astrocytes had alterations in Wnt signaling and cell cycle regulation. Cell-cell communication analysis uncovered sex-specific intercellular signaling patterns, with male-specific impacts on apoptosis-related signaling and female-specific alterations in Wnt and calcium signaling.
DISCUSSION: This study reveals sex-dependent gene expression patterns, pathway alterations, and intercellular communication changes, suggesting the need for sex-specific approaches in AD research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Single-cell transcriptomics reveals significant sex-specific molecular signatures in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Male astrocytes show enhanced modulation of apoptotic and cell death pathways in AD; female astrocytes exhibit distinct alterations in Wnt signaling and cell-cycle regulation. Sex-dimorphic changes in mitochondrial gene expression are observed in excitatory neurons, suggesting divergent energy metabolism profiles may contribute to AD sex differences. RPTOR is identified as a key regulator of male-specific changes in astrocytes, implicating the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway in sex-dependent AD pathology. New cell-cell communication analyses reveal sex-specific patterns of intercellular signaling, providing insights into how cellular interactions may differentially contribute to AD pathology in males and females.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40032887,Neuromorphic deviations associated with transcriptomic expression and specific cell type in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be associated with cortical anatomical atrophy and neurodegeneration across various brain regions. However, the relationships between brain structural changes in AD and gene expression remain unclear. We perform the morphometric similarity network (MSN) analysis to reveal the consistent cortical structural differences in individuals with AD compared to controls, and investigate the associations between brain-wide gene expression and morphometric changes. Furthermore, we identify abnormally MSN-related genes linked to specific cell types as the major contributors to transcriptomic relationships. MSN-related structural changes are located in the lateral ventral prefrontal cortex, temporal pole and medial prefrontal lobe, which are highly associated with the AD's cognitive decline. Analysis of gene expression shows the spatial correlations between AD-related genes and MSN differences. Examination of cell type-specific signature genes indicates that changes in microglia and neuronal transcriptional profiles largely contribute to AD-specific MSN differences. The study map the disease-specific structural alterations in AD down to the cellular level, offering a novel perspective on the linking surface-level changes to molecular mechanisms.",Sci Rep,2025
39924914,Enlarged perivascular spaces correlate with blood-brain barrier leakage and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundThe clinical significance of enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) in Alzheimer' s disease (AD) was ambiguous.ObjectiveTo investigate whether EPVS contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and cognition in AD.MethodsThe study included a total of 64 participants (26 healthy controls and 38 patients with AD). The evaluation of EPVS and BBB permeability was performed in specific anatomical locations: the centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia, and hippocampus. The EPVS ratings were performed according to Potter's instructions. BBB permeability was evaluated using dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI. The relationship between EPVS and global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), cognitive subdomains, and BBB permeability were examined in both groups. Finally, the relationship between CSO BBB permeability and cognition in AD patients was investigated.ResultsHigh-grade CSO EPVS was found associated with AD (OR: 3.40, 95% CI: 1.11-11.90, p = 0.04). In the AD group, a significant correlation was observed between high-grade CSO EPVS and lower MMSE score (r = -0.36, p = 0.03) and verbal fluency (r = -0.44, p = 0.01). High-grade CSO EPVS positively correlated with BBB leakage (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). The BBB permeability of CSO negatively correlated with verbal fluency (r = -0.52, p < 0.001) and attention (r = -0.40, p = 0.01).ConclusionsHigh-grade CSO EPVS is related to BBB leakage, which contributes to cognitive impairment in AD patients, especially verbal frequency. CSO EPVS can function as a convenient AD marker for intervention and therapy.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39891430,Neuroimaging Predictors of Cognitive Resilience against Alzheimer's Disease Pathology.,"OBJECTIVE: Some individuals demonstrate greater cognitive resilience-the ability to maintain cognitive performance despite adverse brain-related changes-through as yet unknown mechanisms. We examined whether cortical thickness in several brain regions confers resilience against cognitive decline in amyloid-positive adults by moderating the effects of thinner cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain regions and of higher levels of tau.
METHODS: Amyloid-positive participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with relevant imaging data were included (n = 160, observations = 473). Risk factors included an AD brain signature and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. Cognitive measures were episodic memory and executive function composites. Mixed effects models tested whether region-specific cortical thickness moderated relationships between markers of AD risk and memory or executive function.
RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, thicker cortex in 8 regions minimized the negative impact of thinner cortex/smaller volume in AD signature regions on executive function. Longitudinally, higher baseline thickness in a composite of these 8 regions predicted less memory decline (p = 0.007) and weakened negative effects of phosphorylated tau on memory decline (p = 0.014), independent of baseline cognition and risk markers.
INTERPRETATION: We identified 8 cortical regions that appear to confer cognitive resilience cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the face of established indicators of AD pathology. Brain regions fostering executive function may enable compensation in later memory performance and confer cognitive resilience against effects of phosphorylated tau and AD-related cortical changes. These ""resilience"" regions suggest the value of focusing on brain regions beyond only those determined to be AD-related and may partially explain variability in AD-related cognitive trajectories.

40094122,"Ligature-induced periodontitis in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease dysregulates neuroinflammation, exacerbates cognitive impairment, and accelerates amyloid pathology.","A growing body of literature has identified periodontal disease among the modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying this relationship is unknown. This study investigated this relationship using a ligature-induced preclinical periodontitis (Pd) model in non-transgenic (non-Tg) and 3xTg-AD mice. We found that ligature placement caused significant alveolar bone loss, with 3xTg-AD mice exhibiting exacerbated bone loss, suggesting AD-related genetic risk may amplify disease progression. Pd induced robust local inflammatory gene expression in both genotypes, but 3xTg-AD mice indicated a dysregulated immune response. Cognitive deficits were observed only in Pd-afflicted 3xTg-AD mice, specifically in hippocampus-mediated spatial memory and perirhinal cortex-mediated object recognition memory, while non-Tg mice remained unaffected. Neuroinflammatory responses varied by brain region, with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) showing the most pronounced changes. In these regions, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited significantly altered cytokine gene expression compared to non-Tg mice, particularly at later time points. Synaptic markers revealed vulnerabilities in 3xTg-AD mice, including reduced baseline Syp expression and dysregulated Synpo post-ligature. Pd transiently reduced glutamate receptor gene expression in both genotypes, with non-Tg mice showing persistent changes, potentially linked to preserved memory. Pd also accelerated amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and sustained neurodegeneration in 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, this study shows that combining Pd and AD-related genetic risk exacerbates inflammation, cognitive impairment, synaptic dysfunction, Aβ pathology, and neurodegeneration. Neither insult alone was sufficient to produce these effects, highlighting the synergistic impact. These findings emphasize the need to explore anti-inflammatory interventions and downstream mechanisms to mitigate the confluence of these diseases.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2025
40004442,"Unravelling the Relationship Between Height, Lean Mass, Alzheimer's Disease and Cognition Through Mendelian Randomization.","BACKGROUND: Genetic evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses suggests that higher lean mass causally protects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhances cognitive function. However, the potential confounding role of height, which shares genetic etiology with lean mass, has not been fully examined.
METHODS: Genetic predictors of whole-body lean mass were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in the UK Biobank cohort (UKB; n = 448,322). Genetic predictors of height were also obtained from UKB (height<sub>0.5M</sub> = 455,332) and from a GWAS meta-analysis (height<sub>1.5M</sub>n = 1,578,425). The study outcomes included clinically diagnosed AD (21,982 cases and 41,944 controls) and cognitive performance (n = 269,867). All study participants were of European ancestry. We conducted univariable and multivariable MR analyses to examine the total and independent effects of lean mass and height on the specified outcomes under different statistical adjustment strategies.
RESULTS: In univariable MR analyses, genetically proxied lean mass (odds ratio [OR] per 1-standard deviation [SD] increase 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.91, p = 3.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and height (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, p = 0.001) were associated with reduced risk of AD. Genetically proxied lean mass (β 0.10, 95% CI 0.08-0.12, p = 6.24 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and height (β 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, p = 1.16 × 10<sup>-15</sup>) were further associated with improved cognitive performance. In multivariable MR analyses, adjustment for height<sub>1.5M</sub> partially attenuated the lean mass association with AD (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74-1.12, p = 0.40), whereas the height<sub>1.5M</sub>-AD association remained similar after adjusting for lean mass (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, p = 0.04). Adjustment for height also attenuated the association of lean mass with cognitive performance (β 0.00, 95% CI -0.07-0.06, p = 0.94), whereas height maintained a similar association with improved cognitive performance after adjustment for lean mass (β 0.07, 95% CI 0.03-0.10, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Height may confound the genetic associations between lean mass and both cognitive performance and AD risk. Residual direct effects of lean mass on AD risk cannot be excluded due to limitations in statistical power and genetic instrument strength in MVMR. These findings emphasize the necessity of adjusting for height when using MR to investigate the clinical effects of lean mass.",Genes (Basel),2025

After excluding those diagnosed with dementia in 2002, 511,935 subjects were included. Subjects with hearing loss between 2002 and 2008 were selected and matched with a control group without hearing impairment based on age and gender. Statistical analyses, including Pearson's chi-squared test and the Cox proportional hazards model, were conducted, controlling for confounding variables such as household income and residential area. Subgroup analysis was also performed for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.ResultsSubjects with hearing loss had a 1.245 times higher risk of all-cause dementia compared to those without hearing loss (adjusted hazard ratio over 3 years, 95% CI = 1.201-1.290), adjusting for gender, age, residence, and income. The adjusted hazard ratios for Alzheimer's disease over 3, 5, 7, and 10 years from the index date were 1.259 (95% CI = 1.211-1.308), 1.258 (95% CI = 1.208-1.310), 1.269 (95% CI = 1.215-1.325), and 1.235 (95% CI = 1.170-1.304), respectively. No significant association was found for vascular dementia, except for 3 years.ConclusionsHearing loss consistently increased the risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease across timespans, suggesting a complex link between hearing loss and neurodegenerative diseases.

Tau PET imaging may serve a dual role in Lewy body disease by measuring cortical tau aggregation as well as assessing dopaminergic loss attributed to binding to neuromelanin within substantia nigra. We sought to characterize <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620, a next generation PET tracer, in individuals with Lewy body disease. We recruited 141 participants for <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 PET scans from the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Stanford Aging and Memory Study, most of whom also had β-amyloid status available (139/141) from PET or cerebrospinal fluid. We compared <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 uptake within entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, precuneus and lingual gyrus, as well as substantia nigra, across participants with Lewy body disease [Parkinson's disease (n = 29), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 14)] and Alzheimer's disease (n = 28), in addition to cognitively unimpaired healthy older adults (n = 70). Mean bilateral signal was extracted from cortical regions of interest in <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 standard uptake value ratio (inferior cerebellar grey reference) images normalized to template space. A subset of participants received cognitive testing and/or the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III motor exam (off medication). <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 uptake was low overall in Lewy body disease and correlated with β-amyloid PET in temporal lobe regions and precuneus. Moreover, inferior temporal <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 uptake was significantly elevated in β-amyloid positive relative to β-amyloid negative participants with Lewy body disease. Temporal lobe <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 signal was not associated with memory in Lewy body disease, but uptake within precuneus and lingual gyrus was associated with worse executive function and attention/working memory performance. Finally, substantia nigra <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 signal was significantly reduced in participants with Parkinson's disease, and lower substantia nigra signal was associated with greater motor impairment. These findings suggest that although levels are lower than in Alzheimer's disease, small elevations in cortical tau are associated with cognitive function in Lewy body disease relevant domains, and that reduced <sup>18</sup>F-PI-2620 binding in substantia nigra may represent loss of dopaminergic neurons. Cortical tau and neuromelanin binding within substantia nigra represent two unique signals in the same PET image that may be informative in the context of cognitive and motor deficits, respectively, in Lewy body disease.",Brain Commun,2025
39732508,The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia.,"The Alzheimer's Association convened a Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure Clinical Practice Guideline workgroup to help combat the major global health challenges surrounding the timely detection, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate disclosure of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other diseases that cause these types of cognitive-behavioral disorders. The newly published clinical practice guidelines are proposed as a structured approach to evaluation. The purpose of the present article is to provide a clinical perspective on the use of neuropsychology within the new framework and practice guidelines outlined under the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD-ADRD) recommendations for primary care and specialty care. Neuropsychological evaluation is a critical component in supporting early and accurate diagnosis and staging, characterizing the clinical profile, assessing trajectory over time, and providing recommendations specifically tailored to the individual and their care team.

40081986,Development and evaluation of a healthcare decision-making intervention for African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads: a mixed-methods study protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a higher proportion of African American care partners due to African American older adults having more than twice the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared with non-Hispanic white older adults in the USA. African American adult daughters are the largest group of care partners of African American persons living with ADRD. Within this role, they are faced with navigating multiple health-related decisions to optimise the quality of life of their parent with ADRD, which can negatively influence their own quality of life. This study is guided by three conceptual frameworks: National Institute on Aging's Health Disparities Research Framework, Black Family Socio-Ecological Context Model and Superwoman Schema. The purpose of this study was to develop a structured culturally responsive prototype intervention that will improve the healthcare decision-making self-efficacy and quality of life of African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads. The prototype intervention will be piloted in a single-group clinical trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be conducted in two phases using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, wherein qualitative data collection follows quantitative data collection to explain the findings. In the first phase, the quantitative data collection will examine the behavioural, sociocultural and environmental lifecourse influences on healthcare decision-making self-efficacy and the quality of life of 70 African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads (ie, persons living with ADRD and their adult daughter care partners). The qualitative data collection will consist of a nested sample of 15 dementia dyads and focus on the decision-making processes that affect current and future healthcare use for the parents living with ADRD. Further, this study will explore how these processes influence the quality of life of both members. In phase 2, integrated findings from phase 1 will provide the basis for the development of the prototype intervention using design thinking and intervention mapping with key informants and community advisory board oversight. Once the prototype intervention is developed, a clinical trial will be conducted. This trial will enrol a new sample of 20 African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads using a pretest-post-test design.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The first phase of the study has been approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05139290). This study will contribute to the development of a structured culturally responsive prototype intervention for African American parent-adult daughter dementia dyads. The findings will determine whether a larger randomised controlled trial is warranted. Results of the research will be disseminated in both academic and community settings.

39948600,Prediction of cognitive conversion within the Alzheimer's disease continuum using deep learning.,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and accurate prognosis of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important to timely assignment to optimal treatment modes. We aimed to develop a deep learning model to predict cognitive conversion to guide re-assignment decisions to more intensive therapies where needed.
METHODS: Longitudinal data including five variable sets, i.e. demographics, medical history, neuropsychological outcomes, laboratory and neuroimaging results, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort were analyzed. We first developed a deep learning model to predicted cognitive conversion using all five variable sets. We then gradually removed variable sets to obtained parsimonious models for four different years of forecasting after baseline within acceptable frames of reduction in overall model fit (AUC remaining > 0.8).
RESULTS: A total of 607 individuals were included at baseline, of whom 538 participants were followed up at 12 months, 482 at 24 months, 268 at 36 months and 280 at 48 months. Predictive performance was excellent with AUCs ranging from 0.87 to 0.92 when all variable sets were considered. Parsimonious prediction models that still had a good performance with AUC 0.80-0.84 were established, each only including two variable sets. Neuropsychological outcomes were included in all parsimonious models. In addition, biomarker was included at year 1 and year 2, imaging data at year 3 and demographics at year 4. Under our pre-set threshold, the rate of upgrade to more intensive therapies according to predicted cognitive conversion was always higher than according to actual cognitive conversion so as to decrease the false positive rate, indicating the proportion of patients who would have missed upgraded treatment based on prognostic models although they actually needed it.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurophysiological tests combined with other indicator sets that vary along the AD continuum can improve can provide aid for clinical treatment decisions leading to improved management of the disease.

39758054,Aβ-reactive T cell polyfunctionality response as a new biomarker for mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves neuroinflammation and amyloid plaque deposition, yet the role of amyloid-reactive immune response in neurodegeneration remains unclear. We investigate amyloid-reactive T cell levels in the Epidemiology of Mild Cognitive Impairment Study in Taiwan (EMCIT) and Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (TPMIC) cohorts.
METHOD: Using diverse amyloid peptide formulations, we established a polyfunctionality assay for five T cell functions and compared mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients to control subjects in both cohorts.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, MCI individuals exhibit higher amyloid-reactive T cell responses than controls. In the TPMIC cohort, CD4+ and CD8+ total response frequencies are notably elevated in MCI (CD4: 1.3%, CD8: 1.91%) versus controls (CD4: 0.15%, CD8: 0.28%; both p &lt; 0.001). Amyloid-reactive T cell response outperforms plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) in discriminating MCI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve CD4+: 0.97; CD8+: 0.96; p-tau181: 0.72; both p &lt; 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Amyloid-reactive T cell polyfunctional response distinguishes MCI from normal aging and could serve as a novel MCI biomarker.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid-reactive polyfunctional T cell responses can be detected in the peripheral circulation.Amyloid-reactive T cell response is significantly enhanced in individuals with mild cognitive impairment compared to age-matched, cognitively unimpaired individuals.The unique discriminative accuracy of amyloid-reactive T cell response is significantly higher than phosphorylated tau181 and is not a result of overall T cell hyperreactivity.Future studies are needed to determine the predictive role of amyloid-reactive T cell responses in disease progression and if the amyloid-reactive immune response could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40086421,Sex and APOE4-specific links between cardiometabolic risk factors and white matter alterations in individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease.,"Early detection of pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered significant attention in the last few decades as interventions aiming to prevent progression will likely be most effective when initiated early. White matter (WM) alterations are among the earliest changes in AD, yet limited work has comprehensively characterized the effects of AD risk factors on WM. In older adults with a family history of AD, we investigated the sex-specific and APOE genotype-related relationships between WM microstructure and risk factors. Multiple MRI-derived metrics were integrated using a multivariate approach based on the Mahalanobis distance (D2). To uncover the specific biological underpinnings of these WM alterations, we then extracted the contribution of each MRI feature to D2 in significant clusters. Lastly, the links between WM D2 and cognition were explored. WM D2 in several regions was associated with high systolic blood pressure, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin, and low cholesterol, in both males and females. APOE4 + displayed a distinct risk pattern, with LDL-cholesterol having a detrimental effect only in carriers, and this pattern was linked to immediate memory performance. Myelination was the main mechanism underlying WM alterations. Our findings reveal that combined exposure to multiple cardiometabolic risk factors negatively impacts microstructural health, which may subsequently affect cognition. Notably, APOE4 carriers exhibited a different risk pattern, especially in the role of LDL, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms in this group.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39760475,Dietary cinnamon promotes longevity and extends healthspan via mTORC1 and autophagy signaling.,"Cinnamon, renowned for its aromatic flavor, represents one of the most widely used spices worldwide. Cinnamon is also considered beneficial to human health with therapeutic potential for treating various diseases, ranging from diabetes and cancer to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying cinnamon's health benefits remain elusive. It is also unclear whether cinnamon has any role in aging. Using C. elegans as a model, here we show that feeding worms cinnamaldehyde (CA), the active ingredient in cinnamon oil, prolongs longevity. CA also promotes stress resistance and reduces β-Amyloid toxicity in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, CA exerts its beneficial effects through mTORC1 and autophagy signaling. Interestingly, CA promotes longevity by inducing a dietary restriction-like state without affecting food intake, suggesting CA as a dietary restriction mimetic. In human cells, CA exerts a similar effect on mTORC1 and autophagy signaling, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Our results demonstrate that dietary cinnamon promotes both lifespan and healthspan and does so by regulating mTORC1 and autophagy signaling.",Aging Cell,2025
39834035,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: State-of-the-science update and narrative review.,"OBJECTIVE: The long-recognized association of brain injury with increased risk of dementia has undergone significant refinement and more detailed study in recent decades. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a specific neurodegenerative tauopathy related to prior exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI). We aim to contextualize CTE within a historical perspective and among emerging data which highlights the scientific and conceptual evolution of CTE-related research in parallel with the broader field of neurodegenerative disease and dementia.
METHODS: We provide a narrative state-of-the-science update on CTE neuropathology, clinical manifestations, biomarkers, different types and patterns of head impact exposure relevant for CTE, and the complicated influence of neurodegenerative co-pathology on symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Now almost 20 years since the initial case report of CTE in a former American football player, the field of CTE continues evolving with increasing clarity but also several ongoing controversies. Our understanding of CTE neuropathology outpaces that of disease-specific clinical correlates or the development of in-vivo biomarkers. Diagnostic criteria for symptoms attributable to CTE are still being validated, but leveraging increasingly available biomarkers for other conditions like Alzheimer's disease may be helpful for informing the CTE differential diagnosis. As diagnostic refinement efforts advance, clinicians should provide care and/or referrals to providers best suited to treat an individual patient's clinical symptoms, many of which have evidence-based behavioral treatment options that are etiologically agnostic. Several ongoing research initiatives and the gradual accrual of gold standard clinico-pathological data will pay dividends for advancing the many existing gaps in the field of CTE.",Clin Neuropsychol,2025
39726013,Therapeutic implications of necroptosis activation in Alzheimer´s disease.,"In recent years, a growing body of research has unveiled the involvement of the necroptosis pathway in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This evidence has shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal death in AD, positioning necroptosis at the forefront as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. This review provides an update on the current knowledge on this emerging, yet rapidly advancing topic, encompassing all published studies that present supporting proof of the role of the necroptosis pathway in the neurodegenerative processes of AD. The implication of misfolded tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates is highlighted, with evidence suggesting their direct or indirect involvement in necroptosis activation. In summary, the review underscores the significance of understanding the complex interplay between necroptosis, protein aggregates, and neurodegeneration in AD. The findings advocate for a comprehensive approach, combining therapeutic and early diagnostic strategies, to intervene in the disease process before irreversible damage occurs.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39995945,Microvascular dysfunction in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease using intravital microscopy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurocognitive disorder. Early theories of AD sought to identify a single unifying explanation underlying AD pathogenesis; however, evolving evidence suggests it is a multifactorial, systemic disease, involving multiple systems. Of note, vascular dysfunction, encompassing both cerebral and peripheral circulation, has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. This pilot study used intravital microscopy to assess differences in responsiveness of gluteal muscle arterioles between a transgenic AD mouse model (APP/PS1; Tg) and wild-type (C57BL/6; WT) mice to further elucidate the role of vascular dysfunction in AD. Arteriole diameters were measured in response to acetylcholine (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M), phenylephrine (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> M), histamine (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> M) and compound 48/80 (10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-3</sup> M). Tg mice demonstrated a trend toward reduced vasodilatory response to acetylcholine with a significant difference at 10<sup>-5</sup> M (36.91 vs. 69.55%: p = 0.0107) when compared to WT. No significant differences were observed with histamine, compound 48/80 or phenylephrine; however, a trend toward reduced vasoconstriction to phenylephrine was observed in Tg mice at higher concentrations. Mean net diameter change (resting to maximum) also differed significantly (p = 0.0365) between WT (19.11 μm) and Tg mice (11.13 μm). These findings suggest reduced vascular responsiveness may contribute to the systemic vascular deficits previously observed in AD models. Future research using diverse models and broader variables could further elucidate peripheral vascular dysfunction's role in AD pathogenesis, including its impact on motor symptoms and disease progression. Such insights may inform the development of vascular-targeted therapeutic strategies.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39716328,Anti-diabetic agents and the risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between anti-diabetic agents and the risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrial.gov between January 1995 and October 2024. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with T2D, which intercompared anti-diabetic agents or compared them with placebo, and reported the incidence of dementia were included. Conventional and network meta-analyses of these studies were implemented. Results were exhibited as the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 41 observational studies (3,307,483 participants) and 23 RCTs (155,443 participants) were included. In the network meta-analysis of observational studies, compared with non-users, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) (OR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.45 to 0.69), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) (OR = 0.58, 95%CI, 0.46 to 0.73), thiazolidinedione (TZD) (OR = 0.68, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.81) and metformin (OR = 0.89, 95%CI, 0.80 to 0.99) treatments were all associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) evaluation conferred a rank order as SGLT-2i > GLP-1RA > TZD > dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) > metformin > α-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) > glucokinase activator (GKA) > sulfonylureas > glinides > insulin in terms of the cognitive benefits. Meanwhile, compared with non-users, SGLT-2i (OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.62), GLP-1RA (OR = 0.54, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.96) and DPP-4i (OR = 0.73, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.93) were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease while a lower risk of vascular dementia was observed in patients receiving SGLT-2i (OR = 0.42, 95%CI, 0.22 to 0.80) and TZD (OR = 0.52, 95%CI, 0.36 to 0.75) treatment. In the network meta-analysis of RCTs, the risks of dementia were comparable among anti-diabetic agents and placebo.
CONCLUSION: Compared with non-users, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA, TZD and metformin were associated with the reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. SGLT-2i, and GLP-1RA may serve as the optimal choice to improve the cognitive prognosis in patients with T2D.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39900278,Higher level of [<sup>3</sup>H]UCB-J binding in ApoE Ɛ4 allele carriers with Alzheimer disease.,"Neuronal and synapse losses are seen under the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, the binding to the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) using the selective radioligand [<sup>3</sup>H]UCB-J was found to be reduced in frontal cortex from patients with AD. We report here that the reduction in SV2A binding is highly significant only in patients not carrying the ApoE ɛ4 allele. By contrast, those individuals with one or two ApoE ɛ4 alleles had SV2A binding levels not different from controls. Because ApoE4 is an important genetic risk and strongly linked to late-onset AD, this study raises an interesting new and unexpected association to SV2A, synapse loss, and function.",Neurosci Lett,2025
39935890,Validity of one-time assessments for identifying prodromal Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: New Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments have created an urgent need for accurate early diagnosis of high-risk adults with Down syndrome (DS), distinguishing prodromal DS-AD symptoms from lifelong cognitive impairments. Often, clinicians will need to evaluate dementia status during a single assessment, and here we describe empirically supported methods effective under such circumstances.
METHODS: Archived data collected between 1987 and 2017 included longitudinal findings for 144 individuals maintaining cognitive stability and 126 developing prodromal DS-AD. Response operating characteristic analyses compared groups, defined by the presence/absence of prodromal DS-AD, for a single assessment.
RESULTS: Groups differed on all measures without adjusting for developmental history, 0.717 &lt; areas under the curve &lt; 0.859, Ps &lt; 0.0001. The balance between sensitivity and specificity improved slightly when developmental histories were considered.
DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrated that one-time assessments can inform clinical judgments when diagnosing adults at risk for DS-AD. Knowledge of developmental history is valuable but non-essential.
HIGHLIGHTS: Non-overlapping distributions were observed for preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups.Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve analyses were in the acceptable to excellent range for all measures.Performance was sensitive to both the severity of intellectual disability and the stage of Down syndrome-AD progression.Episodic memory tests were sensitive to the transition from preclinical to prodromal AD.Performance results at a single time point can inform dementia status decisions.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40057609,Effect of combined and intensive rehabilitation on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease evaluated through a randomized controlled trial.,"This study investigates the impact of combined special education and occupational therapy intervention on cognitive functions in Alzheimer's patients. Specifically, it evaluates changes measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) after six months compared to a control group receiving standard care. A longitudinal, controlled experiment was conducted with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The experimental group underwent three weekly interventions of 45-50 min over eight months in 2021. Cognitive functions were periodically assessed using ACE-R. Power analysis determined a sample size of 128 participants for adequate statistical power; the study included 60 participants (30 per group). Data were analyzed using non-parametric methods due to non-normal data distribution. The experimental group showed significant improvement in ACE-R scores compared to the control group. The mean difference in scores was 10.27 points (SD = 2.83) for the experimental group, indicating improved cognitive function, while the control group showed a mean decrease of 5.67 points (SD = 2.06). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between groups at both interim and final assessments (p < 0.001). The combined special education and occupational therapy intervention led to significant cognitive improvements in Alzheimer's patients compared to standard care. The study supports the efficacy of such interventions in enhancing cognitive functions, as evidenced by the substantial score increases in the experimental group.",Sci Rep,2025
39805913,Enhancing proteasome activity by NMDAR antagonists explains their therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative and mental diseases.,"NMDAR antagonists, such as memantine and ketamine, have shown efficacy in treating neurodegenerative diseases and major depression. The mechanism by which these drugs correct the aforementioned diseases is still unknown. Our study reveals that these antagonists significantly enhance 20S proteasome activity, crucial for degrading intrinsically disordered, oxidatively damaged, or misfolded proteins, factors pivotal in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In our mouse model experiment, ketamine administration notably altered brain synaptic protein profiles within two hours, significantly downregulating proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Furthermore, the altered proteins exhibited enrichment in terms related to plasticity and potentiation, including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling-a pivotal pathway in both short- and long-term plasticity that may elucidate the long-lasting effects of ketamine in major depression. Via the ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome pathway (UIPS), these drugs maintain cellular protein homeostasis, which is crucial as proteasome activity declines with age, leading to protein aggregation and disease symptoms. Therefore, these findings hold promise for new treatment options not only for brain diseases but also for other systemic conditions associated with unfolded or misfolded proteins.",Sci Rep,2025
40097074,Early social deficits in TgF344-AD rats are accompanied by sex-specific parvalbumin-positive interneuron reduction and altered brain oscillations in the hippocampal CA2.,"Social withdrawal and deficits in social cognition are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While early deficits in social behavior and memory have been documented in mouse AD models, they remain understudied in rat models. Early-stage AD is accompanied by dysfunction of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, implicating their potential connection to early symptoms. In this study, we employed a 5-trial social memory task to investigate early deficits in social cognition in 6-month-old TgF344-AD male and female rats. We counted the number of PV+ interneurons and recorded local field potentials during social interactions in the hippocampal CA2 - a region critical for social information processing. Our results show decreased social interest and novelty preference in TgF344-AD male and female rats. However, reduced PV+ interneuron numbers were observed only in female rats and specific to the CA2 area. The electrophysiological recordings revealed reduced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the CA2 during direct social interactions. We conclude that deficits in social cognition accompany early-stage AD in TgF344-AD rats and are potentially linked to PV+ interneuron and brain oscillatory dysfunction in the CA2 region of the hippocampus.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39713239,Brain age in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease.,"The brain-age gap, i.e. the difference between the brain age estimated from structural MRI data and the chronological age of an individual, has been proposed as a summary measure of brain integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we aimed to determine the brain-age gap in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease and its association with surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathology and with rates of cognitive and motor function decline. We studied 1200 cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, asymptomatic and clinical mutation carriers in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), and normal controls using a cohort study design. For comparison, we studied 187 Alzheimer's disease dementia cases and 254 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. We used Bayesian ANOVA to determine associations of the brain-age gap with diagnosis, and baseline measures of motor and cognitive function, dopamine transporter activity and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease type amyloid-β42 and phosphotau pathology. Associations of brain-age gap with rates of cognitive and motor function decline were determined using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. The brain-age gap in idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients was 0.7 years compared to controls, but 5.9 years in Alzheimer's disease dementia cases. In contrast, asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals had a 1.1. year younger brain age than controls. Across all cases, the brain-age gap was associated with motor impairment and (in the clinically manifest PD cases) reduced dopamine transporter activity, but less with CSF amyloid-β42 and phosphotau. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases, however, the brain-age gap was associated with lower CSF amyloid-β42 levels. In sporadic and genetic Parkinson's disease cases, a higher brain-age gap was associated with faster decline in episodic memory, and executive and motor function, whereas in asymptomatic LRRK2 cases, a smaller brain-age gap was associated with faster cognitive decline. In conclusion, brain age was sensitive to Alzheimer's disease like rather than Parkinson's disease like brain atrophy. Once an individual had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, their brain age was associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease rather than Parkinson's disease. Asymptomatic LRRK2 cases had seemingly younger brains than controls, and in these cases, younger brain age was associated with poorer cognitive outcome. This suggests that the term brain age is misleading when applied to disease stages where reactive brain changes with apparent volume increases rather than atrophy may drive the calculation of the brain age.",Brain Commun,2024
40046339,Phase 2 study of palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients.,"Frontotemporal dementia is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which no pharmacological treatments have been approved. Neuroinflammation plays a central role in driving the pathogenic mechanisms underlying frontotemporal dementia. In the last few years, co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline has emerged as a potential therapeutic molecule in neurodegenerative disorders pathogenically related to frontotemporal dementia, for its demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here we wanted to determine whether treatment with co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline may have a clinical impact in frontotemporal dementia patients. We performed a Phase 2, monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline in frontotemporal dementia patients. Forty eight patients with a diagnosis of probable frontotemporal dementia were randomly assign in a 1:1 ratio to receive co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline oral suspension at the dosage of 700 mg + 70 mg twice/day (n = 25) or placebo twice/day (n = 23) for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change at 24-weeks in the Clinical Dementia Rating Dementia Staging Instrument from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and frontotemporal lobar degeneration modules-sum of boxes (CDR plus NACC FTLD-SoB). Secondary outcome measures included the Frontal Assessment Battery, Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini-Mental State Examination and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised. Among 48 patients randomized [mean (SD) age 63.2 (8.4), 23 (47.9%) female], 45 (93%) completed the study. Patients in the co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline group showed less decline for the primary outcome measure (CDR plus NACC FTLD) as compared with patients treated with placebo. The estimated mean change (W0-W24) in CDR plus NACC FTLD score was 0.53 for the co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline group [95% confidence interval (0.12-0.94)] and 1.39 for the placebo group [95% confidence interval (0.96-1.82)], with an estimated mean difference between of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (0.28-1.45), P = 0.005]. Estimated mean change in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living score was -1.8 for co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline (95% confidence interval, -3.67 to 0.06) and -7.39 for placebo (95% confidence interval -9.34 to -5.45). Estimated mean change in screening for Aphasia in neurodegeneration scores was -3.987 for co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline (95% confidence interval, -7.75 to -0.22) and -10.35 for placebo (95% confidence interval, -14.33 to -6.37). No effect of treatment was found on other secondary outcome measures. Our results demonstrate that co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide combined with luteoline shows promising efficacy in slowing down the progression of cognitive and functional symptoms in frontotemporal dementia patients. These findings warrant further investigation and offer potential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for frontotemporal dementia.",Brain Commun,2025
40084663,"Associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms and pathology in clinicopathologically defined Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies, and dementia with Lewy bodies.","BackgroundNeuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, but a higher NPS burden is found in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy body (LB) pathology frequently co-occurs with AD pathology and may not meet neuropathological criteria for DLB (ADLB). NPS trajectories over disease course in these subgroups is not well understood.ObjectiveWe investigated changes in NPS severity over time, at two time points, comparing clinicopathologically defined cohorts of AD (without LB), ADLB, DLB, and controls.MethodsCases with two available Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPIQ), at the time of enrollment and within 2.5 years of death, were selected from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Differences and rate of change in NPIQ scores were compared between AD (n = 75), ADLB (n = 48) DLB (n = 65), and controls (n = 32) with covariates for age, sex, and cognition.ResultsFirst NPIQ scores were highest in ADLB when compared to AD (p = 0.04) and controls (p = 0.01) but not different from DLB. A significant increase in NPS severity was observed in DLB and AD (p &lt; 0.001) over a mean follow up time of 4.9 ± 3.0 years, and the rate of change was significantly greater in DLB when compared to other groups. Final NPIQ scores were highest in DLB when compared to AD (p = 0.03) but not ADLB, and in DLB, ADLB, and AD than controls (all p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsEarly NPS burden as well as NPS severity progression rate, independently of cognitive status, might be useful clinical metrics and may help predict underlying pathological diagnoses.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40082619,Interleukin-12 signaling drives Alzheimer's disease pathology through disrupting neuronal and oligodendrocyte homeostasis.,"Neuroinflammation including interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23-signaling is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Inhibition of p40, a subunit of IL-12/IL-23, attenuates pathology in AD-like mice; however, its signaling mechanism and expression pattern remained elusive. Here we show that IL-12 receptors are predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes in AD-like APPPS1 mice and in patients with AD, whereas IL-23 receptor transcripts are barely detectable. Consistently, deletion of the IL-12 receptor in neuroectodermal cells ameliorated AD pathology in APPPS1 mice, whereas removal of IL-23 receptors had no effect. Genetic ablation of IL-12 signaling alone reverted the loss of mature oligodendrocytes, restored myelin homeostasis, rescued the amyloid-β-dependent reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and restored phagocytosis-related changes in microglia of APPPS1 mice. Furthermore, IL-12 protein expression was increased in human AD brains compared to healthy age-matched controls, and human oligodendrocyte-like cells responded profoundly to IL-12 stimulation. We conclude that oligodendroglial and neuronal IL-12 signaling, but not IL-23 signaling, are key in orchestrating AD-related neuroimmune crosstalk and that IL-12 represents an attractive therapeutic target in AD.",Nat Aging,2025
39767605,The Relevance and Implications of Monoclonal Antibody Therapies on Traumatic Brain Injury Pathologies.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health concern. It remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. TBI pathology involves complex secondary injury cascades that are associated with cellular and molecular dysfunction, including oxidative stress, coagulopathy, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, among others. These pathological processes manifest as a diverse array of clinical impairments. They serve as targets for potential therapeutic intervention not only in TBI but also in other diseases. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used as key therapeutic agents targeting these mechanisms for the treatment of diverse diseases, including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). MAb therapies provide a tool to block disease pathways with target specificity that may be capable of mitigating the secondary injury cascades following TBI. This article reviews the pathophysiology of TBI and the molecular mechanisms of action of mAbs that target these shared pathological pathways in a wide range of diseases. Publicly available databases for various applications of mAb therapy were searched and further classified to assess relevance to TBI pathology and evaluate current stages of development. The authors intend for this review to highlight the potential impact of current mAb technology within pathological TBI processes.",Biomedicines,2024
40166615,Strategic delivery of omega-3 fatty acids for modulating inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases.,"OBJECTIVES: Early-life inflammatory events like infections and injuries may predispose the brain to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by disrupting neurodevelopment and raising vulnerability. The association between early neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration leading to dementia remains unclear. We hypothesize that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FA), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), positively regulate neuro-immune cells, preserving their cell membrane structure and metabolic homeostasis. Our study examined whether strategic delivery of n-3 FA via injectable n-3 triglycerides (TG) can influence microglial lipid metabolism to prevent or delay AD progression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized n-3 treatment effects on modulating lipid and metabolic homeostasis in microglia during the critical window of brain development. Our preliminary studies on determining the effects of early n-3 treatment on brain cell homeostasis indicate that perinatal bolus n-3 TG injections suppressed activation of gliosis-associated markers in young mice predisposed to AD (5xFAD) and yielded sustained regulatory effects on the expression of inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-6 (Il6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnfα), in adult brains. A significant increase in high-frequency ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) was observed in P6 5xFAD mice that received perinatal n-3 compared to vehicle control, implicating enhanced active communication patterns. Improvement in behavior deficits was observed in n-3-treated adult AD mice. Perinatal n-3 TG treatment modified brain lipid composition in young offspring, increasing key membrane lipid species, such as phospholipids (PL) and lysophospholipids (lysoPL). Pro-inflammatory sphingolipids associated with neurodegeneration, including lactosylceramide, were significantly lower in mice treated with n-3 than those in saline-treated AD mice.
CONCLUSION: Our study establishes a proof of principle for targeting brain immune cell metabolism with injectable n-3 TG to mitigate neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis, paving the way for future research into early treatments for related central nervous system (CNS) disorders.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39949469,Diamagnetic Signature of Beta-Amyloid (Aβ) and Tau (τ) Tangle Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.,"The complex interplay between diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances within the brain, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), offers a rich landscape for investigation using advanced quantitative neuroimaging techniques. Although conventional approaches have focused on the paramagnetic properties of iron, emerging and promising research has highlighted the significance of diamagnetic signatures associated with beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and Tau (τ) protein aggregates. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a complex post-processing technique that visualizes and characterizes these subtle alterations in brain border tissue composition, such as the gray-white matter interface. Through voxel-wise separation of the contributions of diamagnetic and paramagnetic sources, QSM enabled the identification and quantification of Aβ and τ aggregates, even in the presence of iron. However, several challenges remain in utilizing diamagnetic signatures of Aβ and τ for clinical applications. These include the relatively small magnitude of the diamagnetic signal compared to paramagnetic iron, the need for high-resolution imaging and sophisticated analysis techniques, and the standardization of QSM acquisition and analysis protocols. Further research is necessary to refine QSM techniques, optimize acquisition parameters, and develop robust analysis pipelines to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting the diamagnetic nature of Aβ and τ aggregates. As our understanding of the diamagnetic properties of Aβ and τ continues to evolve, QSM is expected to play a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",Aging Med (Milton),2025
40116704,Exploring interdisciplinary perspectives on the implementation of personalized medicine and patient-orchestrated care in Alzheimer's disease: A qualitative study within the ABOARD research project.,"BackgroundThe concepts of 'personalized medicine' and 'patient-orchestrated care' in Alzheimer's disease (AD) lack standard conceptualization, which presents challenges for collaborative and interdisciplinary care.ObjectiveWe explored the interpretations and perspectives of professionals involved in interdisciplinary work on a large-scale project, ""ABOARD"", with the aim to implement personalized medicine and patient-orchestrated care in AD.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 professionals and audio-recorded. Two researchers independently coded the data inductively, followed by a thematic analysis.ResultsAccording to professionals across different disciplinary backgrounds (mean age 45.7 years; 53.3% female), personalized medicine pertains to the relevant options that an individual has, informed by biomedical and psychosocial factors, whereas patient-orchestrated care captures factors relevant to the decision-making process. Professionals differed in their views on patient-orchestrated care regarding its desirability and feasibility. The concepts were viewed as similar by professionals, as both involve personal preferences while ultimately assigning responsibility to the clinician. However, implementation challenges persist, and no thematic differences were found between clinicians and other AD-related professionals.ConclusionsAD professionals have shared interpretations and perspectives on implementation of personalized medicine but differed in their views on patient-orchestrated care. Personal preferences are seen as part of personalized medicine, but not yet reflected in definitions in the AD field and beyond. Critical discussions on the challenges and existing doubts are necessary for both personalized medicine and patient-orchestrated care. Multi-level implementation changes are needed for both concepts, which warrants stakeholder involvement as well as support and resources from the entire AD field.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39779708,Stereo-seq of the prefrontal cortex in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"Aging increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), driving pathological changes like amyloid-β (Aβ) buildup, inflammation, and oxidative stress, especially in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We present the first subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptome atlas of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC), generated with Stereo-seq from six male AD cases at varying neuropathological stages and six age-matched male controls. Our analyses revealed distinct transcriptional alterations across PFC layers, highlighted disruptions in laminar structure, and exposed AD-related shifts in layer-to-layer and cell-cell interactions. Notably, we identified genes highly upregulated in stressed neurons and nearby glial cells, where AD diminished stress-response interactions that promote Aβ clearance. Further, cell-type-specific co-expression analysis highlighted three neuronal modules linked to neuroprotection, protein dephosphorylation, and Aβ regulation, with all modules downregulated as AD progresses. We identified ZNF460 as a transcription factor regulating these modules, offering a potential therapeutic target. In summary, this spatial transcriptome atlas provides valuable insight into AD's molecular mechanisms.",Nat Commun,2025
40016362,"Prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life years due to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in Middle East and North Africa, 1990-2021.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranks among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The objective was to evaluate the burden of AD and other dementias among the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by age and sex from 1990 to 2021. The data were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021. The estimates are presented as counts and age-standardised rates per 100,000 accompanied by 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2021, AD and other dementias recorded an age-standardised prevalence of 772.7 per 100,000 in the MENA region (95% UI 671.2-877.6 per 100,000). This rate decreased by 4.9% in comparison to 1990, marking a statistically significant change. AD and other dementias also accounted for approximately 73.79 thousand deaths in the region in 2021, with the age-standardised rate decreasing by 8.6% compared to 1990. Moreover, the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rate was 476.3 per 100,000 population (95% UI 225.6-1004.2), representing a 7.7% decrease from 1990 to 2021. Lebanon registered the highest point prevalence per 100,000 at 828.25, while the United Arab Emirates recorded the lowest at 652.43. The age-standardised point prevalence decreased from 1990 to 2021 in 13 of the MENA countries, while no significant changes were observed in eight of countries. Additionally, in 2021, women experienced higher prevalence rates, DALYs, compared to men. In the MENA region, age-standardised dementia prevalence rose with age in both sexes. The burden of dementia in MENA has decreased from 1990 to 2021, but it remains higher than global estimates. Furthermore, the findings indicate that dementia imposes a greater burden on the female population compared to males. To achieve a more accurate estimation of the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, more systematic studies in low- to middle-income countries within the MENA region are required.",Sci Rep,2025
40042516,Calcineurin inhibition may prevent Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome.,"Virtually all people with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer disease pathology during their lifetime. As Alzheimer disease is the third leading cause of death and a significant factor in end-of-life complications for adults with Down syndrome, identifying interventions is a medical necessity. Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, has recently been investigated as a possible Alzheimer treatment. This review explores the histories behind Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease, and their intersecting pathologies. This is followed by the role that calcineurin and its U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological inhibitor, tacrolimus, may play in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease. Finally, this review discusses the gap in the literature surrounding the role of calcineurin, its regulators, and calcineurin inhibitors in the context of Down syndrome and comorbid Alzheimer disease. Future studies investigating the role that calcineurin plays in this pathology will be essential in determining the viability of calcineurin inhibitors to treat Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome. HIGHLIGHTS: Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, has become prominent as a possible therapeutic target to treat Alzheimer disease. People with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer pathology as they age, requiring novel therapeutics for treatment. People with Down syndrome may exhibit contraindications to calcineurin inhibition-based therapy, as they overexpress RCAN1 and DYRK1A, regulators of calcineurin. There is a significant gap in the literature involving the expression of calcineurin, RCAN1 and DYRK1A, in people with Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease, which must be addressed to determine the efficacy and safety of newly developed therapeutics.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40115028,Rocking during sleep reduces motor deficits and beta-amyloid levels in an Alzheimer's mouse model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, beta-amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Growing evidence suggests a strong link between sleep disturbances and AD progression, with disrupted sleep exacerbating AD progression through increased beta-amyloid and tau accumulation. This relationship indicates that improving sleep quality could slow disease progression and mitigate its effects on the brain. We investigated whether vestibular stimulation (rocking) could mitigate AD pathology in 3xTg mice (n = 58, males). Starting in early adulthood (p60), mice underwent 12-h daily rocking during the light period for four months. Rocking increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep initially, although habituation reduced this effect over time. Despite habituation, rocking slowed motor decline and reduced beta-amyloid levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, tau levels remained unaffected. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of non-pharmacological methods to enhance NREM sleep and modify disease trajectory in AD models.",iScience,2025
40118234,Parsimonious EBM: generalising the event-based model of disease progression for simultaneous events.,"The event-based model of disease progression (EBM) infers a temporal ordering of biomarker abnormalities, defining different disease stages, from short-term data. A key modelling choice of the EBM is that biomarker abnormalities, termed events, are serially ordered. This enforces a strict equality between the number of input biomarkers and the number of model stages, limiting its ability to infer simple staging systems and latent disease processes. To overcome this, we introduce the parsimonious event-based model of disease progression (P-EBM). The P-EBM generalises the EBM to allow multiple new biomarker abnormalities, termed ""simultaneous events"", at each model stage. We evaluate the P-EBM performance in simulated data to show it accurately estimates orderings with arbitrary event arrangements under realistic experimental conditions. When applied to sporadic AD data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the P-EBM estimated a sequence with 7 model stages from a dataset of 12 biomarkers that more closely fitted the data than the EBM. The sets of simultaneous events, such as decreased cerebrospinal fluid total tau and p-tau<sub>181</sub>, correspond closely to latent disease processes. P-EBM patient stages were strongly associated with clinical diagnosis at baseline and future conversion and could be accurately estimated from a smaller number of biomarkers than the EBM. The P-EBM enables the data-driven discovery of simple disease staging systems which could highlight new latent disease processes and suggest practical strategies for patient staging.",Neuroimage,2025
39988644,Identification of small fiber neuropathy in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: A clinicopathological study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) manifests as dementia combined with other neurological symptoms. However, small fiber neuropathy (SFN) and pathology remain unknown in NIID.
METHODS: A total of 294 subjects, including patients with NIID, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and healthy controls (HCs), were included. Clinical scales, sensory and autonomic function testing, and skin biopsy were performed.
RESULTS: NIID patients had more severe sensory and autonomic dysfunction than other groups. Substantial reductions in intraepidermal, sweat gland, and pilomotor nerve fiber densities were observed in NIID patients, with a non-length dependent pattern. Detailed analysis revealed marked reductions in noradrenergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and regenerative nerve fibers. Small fiber densities showed high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing NIID from HCs and other diseases.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to reveal wide and severe loss of small fibers in NIID, suggesting the involvement of SFN in the pathogenesis of NIID.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our study is the first to identify wide and severe non-length dependent small fiber neuropathy in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) patients. Approximately 50% of NIID patients exhibited pure small fiber neuropathy without large fiber or mixed neuropathy. NIID patients showed a significant reduction in noradrenergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and regenerative fiber innervation. Small fiber densities, especially intraepidermal nerve fiber density, demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing NIID patients from healthy controls and other disease groups. Findings suggest that small fiber neuropathy may play a role in the pathogenesis of NIID.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39956964,Increased risk of dementia associated with herpes simplex virus infections: Evidence from a retrospective cohort study using U.S. electronic health records.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is the most common age-related dementia. Recent compelling evidence from previous retrospective electronic health record (EHRs) studies suggests that herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections may be a risk factor for developing dementia. However, no age and propensity score matched studies have been published in a United States general population cohort study to date.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify whether HSV infection shows a significantly increased risk of the development of dementia in a sizable and heterogeneous cohort. We investigated whether herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), or coinfections with both serotypes pose a greater risk of developing dementia across different biological sexes and racial groups.
METHODS: EHRs from patients with a history of HSV or specific serotypes (HSV1 or HSV2) infection were selected for analysis. These records were compared to a propensity-matched control group and analyzed for hazard and odds ratios through TriNetX.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in dementia incidence in the HSV-infected group versus the control. Individuals with a history of HSV, HSV1, HSV2, and coinfection all showed a significant risk of developing dementia compared to controls. Males with HSV2 are at a higher risk of dementia outcome than females with HSV2.
CONCLUSIONS: While consistent with previous reports, these findings are the first to establish a higher risk of developing dementia in patients who have any HSV diagnosis using a nationwide, population-based matched cohort study in the United States.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39749582,Tgm2-Catalyzed Covalent Cross-Linking of IκBα Drives NF-κB Nuclear Translocation to Promote SASP in Senescent Microglia.,"Microglia, as resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and phagocytosing metabolic waste in the brain. Senescent microglia exhibit decreased phagocytic capacity and increased neuroinflammation through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This process contributes to the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we found that SASP was elevated in senescent microglia, and proteomics showed that Tgm2 was upregulated. Mechanistically, we revealed that Tgm2-catalyzed covalent cross-linking of IκBα at K22 and Q248 residues in the cytoplasm of microglia, resulting in the reduction of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB to promote SASP production. Treatment of senescent microglia with Tgm2 inhibitors (Tg2-IN1 and Cys-D) resulted in reduced NF-κB nuclear translocation and decreased SASP. Additionally, oral administration of Cys-D significantly improved the aging phenotype in aged mice. To summarize, Tgm2 is a potential target for antiaging, and inhibitors of Tgm2 can serve as novel prophylactics or senomorphics.",Aging Cell,2025
39949865,Improving cognitive impairment through chronic consumption of natural compounds/extracts: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"INTRODUCTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of extended supplementation (≥6 weeks) with natural compounds or extracts in improving cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Cochrane, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to April 10, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating cognitive outcomes in patients with MCI or AD using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog).
RESULTS: From an initial pool of 6,687 articles, 45 were deemed relevant for qualitative analysis. Of these, 37 studies demonstrated improvements or positive trends in cognitive outcomes with natural compound or extract supplementation. A total of 35 studies met the criteria for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis, involving 4,974 participants, revealed significant improvements in ADAS-Cog scores (pooled standardized mean difference = -2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.26 to -1.50; t<sub>24</sub> = -4.31, p &lt; 0.01) following supplementation. Additionally, a suggestive trend toward improvement in MMSE scores was observed in a subgroup analysis of 1,717 participants (pooled standardized mean difference = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.46, t<sub>18</sub> = 2.27, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: These findings support the potential cognitive benefits of extended (≥6 weeks) supplementation with natural compounds or extracts in individuals with MCI or AD. Further research is warranted to confirm these results and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

40194430,A Semi-Automated Tracking System for Monitoring Treatment with Novel Anti-amyloid Therapies (P12-3.007).,"OBJECTIVE: To present the design and implementation of a clinical tracking system for patients receiving lecanemab.
BACKGROUND: Approval of anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease has spurred new clinical programs to ensure safe and efficient treatment administration. Safe treatment necessitates MRI scans at specific infusion-dependent intervals to screen for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Oversight of scheduling and timing of infusions, MRIs, and clinic visits is essential to ensure appropriately timed infusions but poses logistical challenges when each component is scheduled and managed by different decentralized teams. Manual tracking approaches are cumbersome and may fail with large patient panels or understaffed clinics.
DESIGN/METHODS: We developed a tracking system using electronic health record (EHR)-based reports to capture and organize essential data related to infusions, MRIs, and other clinical features. We export this data to secure external programs, where algorithms identify patients undergoing infusions and MRIs and those needing additional orders, appointment adjustments, phone screenings, and other clinical-administrative tasks, flagging them for timely action. The clinical and administrative teams use this organized information to prioritize tasks, which are manually cross-verified for accuracy.
RESULTS: This clinical tracking system, implemented in a multi-campus academic hospital system, supports the care of over 250 lecanemab patients by generating weekly lists for infusions, MRIs, and phone calls while monitoring ARIA cases. These programs function as intended to deliver these outputs, facilitating a comprehensive view of each patient's clinic appointments and infusion schedules, and identifying time-sensitive tasks across a decentralized hospital network. Limitations include delays in real-time EHR updates and exporting data outside the EHR.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of EHR-based reports with algorithmic logic can support oversight and tracking of patients on novel anti-amyloid therapies. The scalability of semi-automated systems may address safety concerns with manual tracking of larger patient panels. This approach may have applications for other neurologic therapeutics requiring complex patient monitoring.

40095665,Association of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health and apolipoprotein E4 genotype with risk of dementia and mortality.,"BackgroundPoor cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health is becoming prevalent; however, sparse data exist regarding the association of CKM health with incident dementia and all-cause mortality.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether poor CKM health is associated with a higher risk of dementia and all-cause mortality, regardless of APOE4 carrier status.MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, 352,364 participants from the UK Biobank were included. CKM syndrome was identified as a medical condition with the presence of metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, and was classified into five stages (stage 0 to 4). Cox proportional hazards models were applied to explore the association of CKM health with incident dementia and all-cause mortality.ResultsParticipants in stage 2-3 and stage 4 had 1.12-fold (95% CI: 1.02-1.23, p = 0.023) and 2.18-fold (95% CI: 1.96-2.43, p &lt; 0.001) increased risk of incident all-cause dementia compared with those in stage 0. Similarly, participants in stage 4 also had an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.28-1.78, p &lt; 0.001) and vascular dementia (HR = 4.62, 95% CI: 3.54-6.03, p &lt; 0.001). Participants in later stages were at higher risk of all-cause mortality. We found an interaction between CKM health and APOE4 carrier status (p for interaction &lt;0.001), and the relationship between CKM health and dementia was more pronounced in non-APOE4 carriers. Moreover, there were significant additive interactions between APOE4 carrier status and CKM health on the risk of dementia.ConclusionsPoor CKM health is independently associated with an increased risk of dementia, regardless of APOE4 carrier status, and all-cause mortality. These findings imply that promoting CKM health may help to reduce the risk of subsequent dementia and mortality.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

39749840,Retinal dysfunction in APOE4 knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is the predominant form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a strong genetic risk factor for LOAD. As an integral part of the central nervous system, the retina displays a variety of abnormalities in LOAD. Our study is focused on age-dependent retinal impairments in humanized APOE4-knock-in (KI) and APOE3-KI mice developed by the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (MODEL-AD) consortium.
METHODS: All the experiments were performed on 52- to 57-week-old mice. The retina was assessed by optical coherence tomography, fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography, electroretinography, optomotor response, gliosis, and neuroinflammation. mRNA sequencing was performed to find molecular pathways.
RESULTS: APOE4-KI mice showed impaired retinal structure, vasculature, function, vision, increased gliosis and neuroinflammation, and downregulation of synaptogenesis.
DISCUSSION: The APOE ε4 allele is associated with increased susceptibility to retinal degeneration compared to the APOE ε3 allele.
HIGHLIGHTS: Apolipoprotein E (APOE)4 mice exhibit structural and functional deficits of the retina. The retinal defects in APOE4 mice are attributed to increased neuroinflammation.

39713270,Anemia-associated smaller brain volume and sex differences: a cross-sectional study of magnetic resonance imaging in brain health checkups.,"INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a risk factor for dementia development. However, few studies have examined the relationship between brain volume and anemia. This study aimed to analyze the association between anemia and brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data from brain health checkups.
METHOD: Participants underwent brain health checkups between January 2015 and March 2022. Blood samples were collected to measure hemoglobin concentrations and mean corpuscular volumes. The modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive function. Magnetic resonance images were analyzed using voxel-based Morphometry to evaluate the overall patterns of brain volume. After extracting the principal components (PCs) from PC analysis, we investigated their association with MMSE scores and anemia.
RESULTS: This study included 1,029 participants and identified principal components, representing smaller volume in the frontal lobe (PC1), and smaller volume in the limbic system to the temporal lobe (PC2). A higher PC2 score was significantly associated with a lower MMSE score. Male participants with anemia had smaller bilateral PC1 volumes and left hippocampal volumes, and female participants with anemia had smaller bilateral PC2 volumes and hippocampus volumes.
DISCUSSION: PC2 may represent the extent of disease affecting limbic system volume, such as Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that anemia may be associated with smaller volumes in the limbic system, especially in women. Further studies are required to determine which type of anemia is more strongly correlated with smaller brain volumes.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39748851,"Discovery and clinical translation of ceperognastat, an O-GlcNAcase (OGA) inhibitor, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: The aggregation and spread of hyperphosphorylated, pathological tau in the human brain is hypothesized to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as other neurogenerative tauopathies. O-GlcNAcylation, an important post-translational modification of tau and many other proteins, is significantly decreased in brain tissue of AD patients relative to healthy controls. Increased tau O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to reduce tau pathology in mouse in vivo tauopathy models. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from tau thereby driving interest in OGA inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce tau pathology and slow the progression of AD.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary approach was used to identify ceperognastat (LY3372689) as a potent OGA inhibitor, including an extensive discovery effort with synthetic chemistry, structure-based drug design, and in vivo OGA enzyme occupancy studies. Preclinical studies assessed the target engagement, inhibition of OGA enzyme activity, OGA enzyme occupancy, and changes in tau O-GlcNAc. Four clinical Phase 1 studies of ceperognastat in healthy participants were performed to assess clinical safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and enzyme occupancy.
RESULTS: Ceperognastat is a potent, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, low-dose inhibitor of OGA, which can achieve > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in animal and human brain. Overall, ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 clinical studies with no serious adverse events reported following single and multiple dosing. The PK, enzyme occupancy, and safety profile supported Phase 2 development of ceperognastat.
DISCUSSION: Ceperognastat is an orally available, highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA inhibitor that achieved high (> 80%) OGA enzyme occupancy and increased brain O-GlcNAc-tau preclinically. Ceperognastat demonstrated > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in Phase 1 trials. These occupancy data informed the dose selection for the Phase 2 clinical program.
HIGHLIGHTS: Ceperognastat is a highly potent, CNS-penetrant OGA inhibitor.Ceperognastat is both orally available and CNS-penetrant even when given at low doses.Ceperognastat can achieve > 95% OGA enzyme occupancy in the animal and human brain.Ceperognastat had an acceptable safety profile in Phase 1 clinical studies.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40055511,Physics-informed machine learning for automatic model reduction in chemical reaction networks.,"Physics-informed machine learning bridges the gap between the high fidelity of mechanistic models and the adaptive insights of artificial intelligence. In chemical reaction network modeling, this synergy proves valuable, addressing the high computational costs of detailed mechanistic models while leveraging the predictive power of machine learning. This study applies this fusion to the biomedical challenge of Aβ fibril aggregation, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease. Central to the research is the introduction of an automatic reaction order model reduction framework, designed to optimize reduced-order kinetic models. This framework represents a shift in model construction, automatically determining the appropriate level of detail for reaction network modeling. The proposed approach significantly improves simulation efficiency and accuracy, particularly in systems like Aβ aggregation, where precise modeling of nucleation and growth kinetics can reveal potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, the automatic model reduction technique has the potential to generalize to other network models. The methodology offers a scalable and adaptable tool for applications beyond biomedical research. Its ability to dynamically adjust model complexity based on system-specific needs ensures that models remain both computationally feasible and scientifically relevant, accommodating new data and evolving understandings of complex phenomena.",Sci Rep,2025
40116694,"Cerebrospinal fluid HSP90AA1, HSPA4, and STUB1/CHIP levels in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and frontotemporal dementia.","BackgroundThe data that we gathered from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction tool, FpClass, and a limited number of studies indicated that the chaperones HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB1/CHIP might interact with amyloid-β (Aβ) and/or tau and could subsequently be co-released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, we investigated CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, and STUB1/CHIP in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Non-AD mild cognitive impairment (Non-AD MCI), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases.MethodsThe CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB/CHIP, and core AD biomarkers were determined by ELISA in AD (n = 90), Non-AD MCI (n = 27), FTD (n = 15), and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (n = 20) subjects.ResultsHSP90AA1 levels were significantly higher in AD cases compared to the SCI subjects. The CSF levels of STUB1/CHIP were significantly lower in AD, Non-AD MCI and FTD cases compared to the SCI subjects. STUB1/CHIP levels of FTD cases were significantly lower than all other groups. HSPA4 levels was correlated with core AD biomarkers (Aβ 1-42, p-Tau, t-Tau) regardless of disease. Non-APOE ε4 carrier FTD cases also had significantly lower STUB1/CHIP levels than other groups.ConclusionsThe STUB1/CHIP holds promise as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between SCI subjects, AD, and FTD. Furthermore, APOE might serve as an additional discriminatory factor that might be integrated with this chaperone for enhanced discrimination.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39834700,Feasibility and potential diagnostic value of [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 PET in patients with down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease: a case series.,"PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Adults with Down Syndrome (DS) have a substantially increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the triplicated amyloid-precursor-protein gene on chromosome 21, resulting in amyloid and tau accumulation. However, tau PET assessments are not sufficiently implemented in DS-AD research or clinical work-up, and second-generation tau tracers such as [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 have not been thoroughly characterized in adults with DS. We aim at illustrating feasibility and potential diagnostic value of tau PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 for the diagnosis of DS-AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five adults with DS (40% female, aged 43-62) and cognitive decline underwent clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing, lumbar puncture and multimodal neuroimaging. All underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]PI-2620 tau PET. Visual read of tau PET scans was performed by three blinded raters, assessing increased tracer uptake in brain areas corresponding to the six Braak stage regions and basal ganglia.
RESULTS: Visual read of tau burden revealed three tau-positive individuals which corresponded to their clinical decline while two cognitively stable individuals were rated as negative. Rating showed high inter-rater reliability for all Braak stages.
CONCLUSION: Tau PET imaging is a feasible and important biomarker assessment in the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline in adults with DS at risk of developing AD.",Front Neurosci,2024
39936232,Remote cognitive tests predict neurodegenerative biomarkers in the Insight 46 cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers detect pathology years before symptoms emerge, when disease-modifying therapies might be most beneficial. Remote cognitive testing provides a means of assessing early cognitive changes. We explored the relationship between neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognition in cognitively normal individuals.
METHODS: We remotely deployed 13 computerized Cognitron tasks in 255 Insight 46 participants. We generated amyloid load and positivity, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), whole brain and hippocampal volumes at age 73, plus rates of change over 2 years. We examined the relationship between Cognitron, biomarkers, and standard neuropsychological tests.
RESULTS: Slower response time on a delayed recognition task predicted amyloid positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.95), and WMHV (1.23, CI: 1.00, 1.56). Brain and hippocampal atrophy rates correlated with poorer visuospatial performance (b = -0.42, CI: -0.80, -0.05) and accuracy on immediate recognition (b = -0.01, CI: -0.012, -0.001), respectively. Standard tests correlated with Cognitron composites (rho = 0.50, p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Remote computerized testing correlates with standard supervised assessments and holds potential for studying early cognitive changes associated with neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: 70% of the Online 46 cohort performed a set of remote online cognitive tasks. Response time and accuracy on a memory task predicted amyloid status and load (SUVR). Accuracy on memory and spatial span tasks correlated with longitudinal atrophy rate. The Cognitron tasks correlated with standard supervised cognitive tests. Online cognitive testing can help identify early AD-related memory deficits.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39709278,Do Caregivers Value the New Antiamyloid Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease More Than Home-Based Care?,"OBJECTIVE: The new antiamyloid medications Lecanemab (Leqembi) and donanemab (Kisunla) are the first disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to receive full FDA approval. However, some commentators question whether the drugs' benefits outweigh their risks, burdens, and costs to patients. This study assessed the perceived value of these medications by asking caregivers of persons with AD to compare them to a widely used intervention in AD management: home-based care.
DESIGN: Online survey (March 27th-April 17th, 2024) of 392 AD caregivers recruited via CloudResearch Prime Panels to match the U.S. public in education, household income, race, and ethnicity. The survey used vignettes describing antiamyloid medication and 25 hours/week of home-based care (estimated to be of similar monetary value). After rating the desirability of medication and home-based care, respondents indicated their preference for which intervention they wanted their loved one's insurance to cover.
RESULTS: Respondents expressed a desire for their loved ones to receive both the medication and home-based care. Over half (56.9%) favored home-based care coverage. Those preferring medication coverage were more likely to believe its benefits outweigh its risks and burdens. Preference for medication coverage was also associated with being male, Hispanic, less educated, and correctly answering fewer comprehension questions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show most caregivers perceive modest clinical value in the novel antiamyloid therapies, and the decision to use these drugs will be preference-sensitive, pointing to the need for thorough informed consent discussions.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,2025
40168089,"The Association of Circulating Immune Cells with Cognitive Function, Brain Imaging, and Incident all-cause and Alzheimer's Dementia: The Framingham Offspring Study.","BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence supports the central role of the immune system in brain health, yet little is known about the role of circulating immune cells and cognitive function or brain health in dementia-free populations. We investigated the association of 43 immune cells with cognitive function, structural brain imaging, and incident dementia in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants.
METHODS: Immune cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Linear mixed effects models were used for cross-sectional associations between immune cells and four cognitive domain scores and 13 brain MRI measurements. Cox proportional hazards regression models tested the relationship between immune cells and time to dementia. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, CMV status, and APOE genotype, with further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Data was further stratified by CMV status.
RESULTS: Among 795 participants with cellular phenotyping, cognitive testing and brain imaging data (mean age 61, 52% women), there were no associations between immune cells and cognitive test scores. Several significant associations between immune cells and regional brain MRI measurements were observed. Higher CD8+ cells [CD8+CD45RO-CCR7-CD27-(Teff), CD8+CD45RA+CD28-CD57+(TEMRA), CD8+CD27-CD28-] associated with greater cerebrum gray and frontal gray matter volumes and inclusion of cardiovascular risk factors strengthened the association. Among CMV+ participants, CD8+TEMRA and CD8+Teff cells were significantly associated with higher total gray and frontal gray matter volumes. No significant associations were observed between immune cells and incident all-cause or Alzheimer's disease dementia.
CONCLUSION: The pathobiology underpinning the associations between immune cells and brain volumes require further study and validation in diverse samples.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,2025
40002740,Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Mechanisms and Corresponding Therapeutic Strategies.,"Neurodegenerative disease (ND) refers to the progressive loss and morphological abnormalities of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent studies have shown that mitochondria play a broad role in cell signaling, immune response, and metabolic regulation. For example, mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with the onset and progression of a variety of diseases, including ND, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The dysfunction of energy metabolism, imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics, or abnormal mitophagy can lead to the imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis, which can induce pathological reactions such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, damage the nervous system, and participate in the occurrence and development of degenerative nervous system diseases such as AD, PD, and ALS. In this paper, the latest research progress of this subject is detailed. The mechanisms of oxidative stress, mitochondrial homeostasis, and mitophagy-mediated ND are reviewed from the perspectives of β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, dopamine neuron damage, and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutation. Based on the mechanism research, new ideas and methods for the treatment and prevention of ND are proposed.",Biomedicines,2025

39814521,Modulating effects of fitness and physical activity on Alzheimer's disease: Implications from a six-month randomized controlled sports intervention.,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity and fitness are major targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD) preventive research. However, current research is heterogeneous and often disregards the relationship between these parameters and disease outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of physical activity and fitness on AD within the context of a multicomponent sports intervention.
METHODS: 46 participants with early-stage AD (mean age 70 ± 7 years, 18 women, mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score 19±5) were included in a six-month randomized controlled trial (Dementia-MOVE), participating in either a multicomponent sports intervention or a control condition with a psychoeducational program. The modulating effect of fitness and physical activity changes on AD outcome parameters such as cognition, function and cerebral brain structure from 3T-MRI were examined using multiple linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: An increase in VO<sub>2</sub>max was associated with assignment to the intervention group (p = 0.016), lower baseline fitness (p = 0.001), and an increased rate of physical activity (p = 0.046). Only in the intervention group, ΔVO<sub>2</sub>max had a beneficial modulating effect on the MoCA score (p = 0.039), the executive functions (p = 0.017) and regional brain volumes of the temporal lobe, e.g., the hippocampus (p = 0.044). High daily step count was associated with preserved executive functions (p = 0.001), and caregivers' quality of life (p ≤ 0.001) in the overall sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that multicomponent exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness in AD, which is associated with advantageous developments in cognitive performance and preservation of brain structure. These findings suggest that especially patients with comparably worse cognition and fitness benefit and should be encouraged for activity engagement.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39853853,Polygenic risk discriminates Lewy body dementia from Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Lewy body dementia (LBD) shares genetic risk factors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including apolipoprotein E (APOE), but is distinguishable at the genome-wide level. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may therefore improve diagnostic classification.
METHODS: We assessed diagnostic classification using AD-PRS excluding APOE (AD-PRS<sub>no</sub> <sub>APOE</sub>), APOE risk score (APOE-RS), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), in 83 participants with LBD, 27 with positron emission tomography amyloid beta (Aβ)positive mild cognitive impairment or AD (MCI+/AD), and 57 controls.
RESULTS: Together AD-PRS<sub>no</sub> <sub>APOE</sub> and APOE-RS performed similarly to p-tau181 in discriminating MCI+/AD from controls (area under the curve 76% vs. 79%) and LBD (71% vs. 72%). In LBD, Aβ positivity was significantly associated with APOE-RS, but not with AD-PRS<sub>no</sub> <sub>APOE</sub>, or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS<sub>no</sub> <sub>APOE</sub>, APOE-RS, and p-tau181 improved the discrimination of MCI+/AD from controls (81%) and LBD (75%), and the detection of Aβ in LBD (82%).
DISCUSSION: Aβ deposition in LBD was associated with APOE, while MCI+/AD was also associated with AD-PRS beyond APOE. AD-PRS explains phenotypic variance not captured by APOE or p-tau181.
HIGHLIGHTS: We investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score (PRS), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) to classify AD and Lewy body dementia (LBD). AD-PRS with APOE achieved similar classification accuracy to p-tau181. AD-PRS without APOE significantly contributed to discriminating AD from LBD. Amyloid beta positivity in LBD was associated with APOE but not AD-PRS without APOE or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS, APOE, and p-tau181 improved diagnostic classification accuracy.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40151896,Abnormal epigenetic modification of lysosome and lipid regulating genes in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundAbnormal lipid metabolism has been identified as a potential pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which might be epigenetically regulated. Lysosomes are critical organelles for lipid metabolism. However, the epigenetic modifications of lysosome and lipid regulating genes remain unclear in AD patients.ObjectiveExplore the role of abnormal epigenetic modifications, especially methylation of lysosome and lipid metabolism-related genes in AD.MethodsMethylation beadchip and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used to detect genome-wide DNA methylation levels and validate key gene methylation, respectively. Clinical data were collected from all participants. Associations between clinical biochemical characteristics and altered DNA methylation in AD patients were analyzed, and a risk factor model of AD was established.Results41 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) corresponding to 33 genes were identified in AD patients, with 18 hypermethylated and 23 hypomethylated positions. Significant alterations were observed in lipid regulating genes (CTNNB1, DGKQ, SLC27A1) and lysosomal transmembrane gene (TMEM175). Clinical analysis revealed that TP, ALB, IB, ADA, ALP, HCY, GLU, TC, BUN, HDL-C, LDL-C, and APOA1 levels were significantly higher in AD patients, whereas A/G and DB levels were lower. TMEM175 hypermethylation was further verified and found to correlate with TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, APOA1, IB, and HCY. The AUC of the AD risk model, which integrated clinical lipid markers and TMEM175 methylation, reached 0.9519 (p &lt; 0.0001).ConclusionsAbnormal epigenetic regulation of lysosomal gene and lipid dyshomeostasis were high-risk factors in AD.

39702044,Genetic and neuro-epigenetic effects of divergent artificial selection for feather pecking behaviour in chickens.,"Feather pecking (FP) is a repetitive behaviour in chickens, influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, similar to behaviours seen in human developmental disorders (e.g., hyperactivity, autism). This study examines genetic and neuro-epigenetic factors in the thalamus of chickens from lines selected for seven generations for high or low FP behaviour (HFP or LFP). We integrate data on Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in this controlled artificial selection process. Significant differences in behaviour, immunology, and neurology have been reported in these lines. We identified 710 SNPs in these lines that indicate new potentially important genes for FP such as TMPRSS6 (implicated in autism), and SST and ARNT2 (somatostatin function). CNV were the omic level most affected during selection. The largest CNVs found were in RIC3 (gain in HFP) and SH3RF2 (gain in LFP) genes, linked to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation and human oncogenesis, respectively. Our study also suggests that promoters and introns are hotspots for CpG depletion. The overlapping of the omic levels investigated here with data from a public FP Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) database revealed novel candidate genes for understanding repetitive behaviours, such as RTKN2, associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans. This study suggests CNVs as a crucial initial step for genomic diversification, potentially more impactful than SNPs.",BMC Genomics,2024
39777865,The MR1/MAIT cell axis enhances dystrophic neurite development in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Plaques are a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that the loss of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and their antigen-presenting molecule MR1 caused a delay in plaque pathology development in AD mouse models. However, it remains unknown how this axis is impacting dystrophic neurites.
METHODS: Brain tissue from 5XFAD mice and those that are MR1 deficient (MR1 KO), were analyzed for dystrophic neurites, amyloid plaques, and synapses via immunofluorescence, RNA sequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and western blot.
RESULTS: In 8-month-old 5XFAD/MR1 KO mice, there was reduced expression of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, ubiquitin, and n-terminal amyloid precursor protein in the hippocampus compared to 5XFAD mice (P < 0.05). 5XFAD/MR1 KO mice also had less insoluble amyloid beta 40 (P < 0.001) and higher levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (P < 0.01) in the hippocampus.
DISCUSSION: Our data contribute additional mechanistic insight into the detrimental role of the MR1/MAIT cell axis in AD pathology development.
HIGHLIGHTS: 5XFAD mice lacking the innate immune MR1/MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T) cell axis (5XFAD/MR1 KO) have reduced numbers of dystrophic neurite markers in the hippocampus at 8 months of age. Hippocampal tissue transcriptional analyses showed reduced expression of genes encoding classical dystrophic neurite markers in 5XFAD/MR1 KO mice. 5XFAD/MR1 KO mice had less insoluble amyloid beta 40 and increased levels of the post-synaptic marker, postsynaptic density protein 95, in the hippocampus than did MR1+ 5XFAD mice.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40145267,Cut-points and gray zones: The challenges of integrating Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers into clinical practice.,"Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as plasma phosphorylated (p)-tau217, offer a more accessible means of testing for the presence of AD pathology compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) methods. They can support diagnostic assessment and determine patient eligibility for treatment with amyloid beta-lowering drugs in community settings where access to CSF examination and amyloid-PET are limited. However, there are important challenges associated with interpreting and integrating plasma biomarker results in clinical practice. This article explores different approaches to interpreting plasma biomarker results in secondary care, important potential sources of uncertainty, and considerations for their clinical application. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma biomarkers such as phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) offer a promising, accessible alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) for detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology, especially in settings with limited diagnostic resources. Clinical integration of plasma biomarker testing presents challenges, particularly in interpreting results. This includes uncertainties around intermediate results and their role in patient management. Clear frameworks and guidelines are essential to optimize the use of plasma biomarkers, supported by further research and education to ensure effective application in clinical practice.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

METHODS: The workgroup identified key research questions that guided a systematic literature review on clinical amyloid/tau PET. Building on this review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each scenario by consensus as ""rarely appropriate,"" ""uncertain,"" or ""appropriate."" Ratings were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone modalities.
RESULTS: For amyloid PET, seven scenarios were rated as appropriate, two as uncertain, and eight as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, five scenarios were rated as appropriate, six as uncertain, and six as rarely appropriate.
DISCUSSION: AUC for amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for clinical use of these technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: A multidisciplinary workgroup convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging updated the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. The goal of these updated AUC is to assist clinicians in identifying clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be useful for guiding the diagnosis and management of patients who have, or are at risk for, cognitive decline These updated AUC are intended for dementia specialists who spend a significant proportion of their clinical effort caring for patients with cognitive complaints, as well as serve as a general reference for a broader audience interested in implementation of amyloid and tau PET in clinical practice.",Alzheimers Dement,2025

40025711,Revisiting the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in a European cohort of elderly living with type 2 diabetes.,"BackgroundIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia.ObjectiveThis prospective cross-sectional study assessed the screening ability of the standard Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score suggestive of mild cognitive impairment (<26) in a European cohort of individuals ≥65 of age with type 2 diabetes.MethodsParticipants of RECOGNISED, a European prospective EU-funded cohort study, were screened using MoCA. In addition, a 13-item Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) with the Clinical Dementia Rating was undertaken to categorize participants as normocognitive (NC, n = 128) or mild cognitive impaired (MCI, n = 185). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the ability of MoCA cut-off scores to categorize patients as having MCI or not.ResultsThe standard MoCA cut-off of 25/26 demonstrated a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 51%, resulting in a false positive rate of 20%. ROC analysis showed that a MoCA cut-off of 24/25 has a better balance between sensitivity (81%) and specificity (62%), with a lower false positive rate of 16%. NTB results showed that the MCI group had the lowest norm-referenced percentile scores in the visuo-construction domain, a known early feature of Alzheimer's disease and a significant predictor of a rapid rate of disease progression.ConclusionsMoCA as a screening tool in individuals ≥65 with type 2 diabetes, overestimates the prevalence of MCI, even when applying lower cut-offs. More specific screening strategies are necessary, particularly targeting the visuo-construction domain, to effectively identify cognitive impairment in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40126601,HDAC3 as an Emerging Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease and other Neurological Disorders.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aged population. Histone acetylation is a major epigenetic mechanism linked to memory formation and cognitive function. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues in histone proteins. Although pan-HDAC inhibitors are effective in ameliorating AD phenotypes in preclinical models, they are associated with potential unfavorable adverse effects and barely translated into clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel HDAC inhibitors with a well isoform-selectivity has been desired in AD drug discovery. Among various HDAC isoforms, HDAC3 is highly expressed in neurons and exhibits detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Moreover, HDAC3 provokes neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity and contributes to AD pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight HDAC3 as an attractive therapeutic target for disease-modifying therapy in AD. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential of HDAC3 inhibitors in other neurological disorders.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39980902,Whole Genome Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis in Alzheimer Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Investigation into different allelic variants may yield new associative genes to predict late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are important polymorphic components of the genome; however, they have been previously overlooked because of their complex genotyping. New software can now determine differing lengths of VNTRs; however, this has not been tested in a large case-control population.
METHODS: We used VNTRseek to genotype over 200,000 tandem repeats in 9,501 cases and controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. We first identified limiting factors of this analysis and then examined the association of VNTRs with AD diagnosis in a subset of non-Hispanic White participants.
RESULTS: We found that VNTRs were highly associated with areas of the genome with a high number of previously identified variants. From our case-control analysis, we identified 9 VNTRs with a repeat allele length associated with LOAD including VNTRs on DSC3, NR2E3, CCNY, PKP4, GRAP, and MAP6.
DISCUSSION: We were able to show the feasibility of this new type of analysis in large-scale whole-genome sequencing data and identify promising VNTRs that are associated with LOAD.",Neurol Genet,2025
40151895,The relationship between Alzheimer's disease and intracerebral hemorrhage based on Mendelian randomization.,"BackgroundTraditional epidemiologic studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).ObjectiveTo explore whether there is a causal relationship between AD and ICH and the underlying mechanisms involved.MethodsMendelian randomization (MR) approach was used to explore causal relationships. The genetic instrumental variables of the candidate genetic instrumental variable AD were obtained from genome-wide association studies. The inverse variance weighted method was the primary method for MR analysis and meta-analysis. The obtained single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed for corresponding genes for subsequent pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis.ResultsFor the single AD dataset, our MR analysis of the AD datasets versus the ICH datasets revealed a genetically predicted causal relationship between AD and ICH (OR 5.947, 95%CI 1.165-30.356, p<sub>IVW </sub>= 0.032). In addition, the MR-Egger method and MR-PRESSO method revealed no horizontal pleiotropic effect of AD on the risk of ICH. Meta-analysis of each dataset using IVW revealed a final calculated OR of 1.08 (95%CI 1.02-1.15, p = 0.01). Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the corresponding genes were involved mainly in the metabolic process of amyloid-β (Aβ) and negatively regulated Aβ formation. In the PPI network analysis, proteins such as ApoE, SROL1, CLU, ABCA7, and AβPP were found to be closely related and located in the key position of the center.ConclusionsWe verified the causal relationship between AD and ICH via MR, and identified the possible pathological mechanisms involved. We also discovered that Aβ plays an important role in this process.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39777048,Research on the application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy in differentiating subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disorder. Based on clinical characteristics, it can be categorized into normal cognition (NC), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (AD). Once the condition begins to progress, the process is usually irreversible. Therefore, early identification and intervention are crucial for patients. This study aims to explore the sensitivity of fNIRS in distinguishing between SCD and MCI.
METHODS: An in-depth analysis of the Functional Connectivity (FC) and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) characteristics during resting state and different memory cognitive tasks is conducted on two patient groups to search for potential biomarkers. The 33 participants were divided into two groups: SCD and MCI.
RESULTS: Functional connectivity strength during the resting state and hemodynamic changes during the execution of Verbal Fluency Tasks (VFT) and MemTrax tasks were measured using fNIRS. The results showed that compared to individuals with MCI, patients with SCD exhibited higher average FC levels between different channels in the frontal lobe during resting state, with two channels' FC demonstrating significant ability to distinguish between SCD and MCI. During the VFT task, the overall average HbO concentration in the frontal lobe of SCD patients was higher than that of MCI patients from 5 experimental paradigm. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that the accuracy of the above features in distinguishing SCD from MCI was 78.8%, 72.7%, 75.8%, and 66.7%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: fNIRS could potentially serve as a non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of dementia.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40108056,Identification of Key Fatty Acid Metabolism-Related Genes in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and the role of fatty acid metabolism in its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Using AD transcriptome sequencing data from the GEO database, we initially screened for differentially expressed genes and applied Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify crucial gene modules. By intersecting these genes with fatty acid metabolism-related genes (FAMRGs), we obtained AD-related fatty acid metabolism genes (AD-FAMRGs). Subsequently, we conducted KEGG, GO, and Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA). Furthermore, we employed three machine learning algorithms to determine the key AD-FAMRGs. Risk genes were thus identified, leading to the construction of a risk model which was subsequently validated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Additionally, protein docking studies were performed to assess interactions between key AD-FAMRGs and Tau as well as amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins. To explore potential therapeutic avenues, we searched the DrugBank database for agents targeting these AD-FAMRGs, followed by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Our investigations highlighted three key AD-FAMRGs: DLD, ELOVL5, and HMGCS1. Functional enrichment analysis indicated their association with metabolism, oxidative stress, and AD pathogenesis. ZDOCK analysis further suggested their interactions with Tau and Aβ proteins, pointing to their possible involvement in AD's pathological processes. ROC analysis demonstrated the predictive accuracy of these AD-FAMRGs, with AUC values ranging from 0.764 to 0.876. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations confirmed the favorable binding of predicted therapeutic agents to these key AD-FAMRGs. Our findings suggest that fatty acid metabolism may be involved in AD pathogenesis, and DLD, ELOVL5, and HMGCS1 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40065171,Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .",Nat Med,2025
39768683,Deep Brain Stimulation Combined with NMDA Antagonist Therapy in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: In Silico Trials.,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is employed to adjust the activity of impaired brain circuits. The variability in clinical trial outcomes for treating Alzheimer's disease with memantine is not yet fully understood. We conducted a randomized in silico study comparing virtual DBS therapies with treatment involving an NMDA antagonist combined with DBS in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Neural network models representing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were randomly assigned to four groups: AD, memantine treatment, DBS, and DBS and memantine. Out of 100 unique neural networks created to model moderate and severe AD with varying hippocampal synaptic loss, 20 were randomly selected to represent AD patients. Virtual treatments-memantine, DBS, and DBS and memantine-were applied, resulting in a total of 80 simulations. Results: The normalized mean number of spikes in the CA1 region among the virtual AD hippocampi treated with memantine, DBS therapy, and DBS and memantine differed significantly (p &lt; 0.0001). The normalized mean number of spikes in the virtual AD hippocampi was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.29-0.36) and was significantly lower compared to the number of spikes in the virtual AD hippocampi treated with memantine, which was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.48-0.59) (p = 0.0162), and in the DBS and memantine group, which was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.57-0.78) (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Our simulation results indicate the effectiveness of virtual memantine and DBS therapy compared to memantine monotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.",J Clin Med,2024
40052092,The role of Apolipoprotein E4 on cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonisms.,"Cognitive impairment is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing the risk of dementia as the disease progresses. Despite its clinical significance, the etiology of cognitive impairment in PD remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a well-known genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's disease, has been studied for its potential role in PD-related cognitive impairment. However, findings have been conflicting and thus inconclusive, highlighting a need to critically evaluate the current research. Several studies using neuroimaging modalities have explored the brains of individuals with PD and atypical parkinsonian disorders who have APOE4. Some of these studies have identified distinct neuropathological changes that have been previously reported to be associated with cognitive impairments in those with Parkinsonisms. Here, we review the role of APOE4 on cognitive impairment in PD and atypical Parkinsonisms using neuroimaging evidence. We will examine how APOE4 may contribute to pathological changes within the brain and its association with cognitive impairment.",Front Neurosci,2025
39775479,Cholesterol Metabolism in CNS Diseases: The Potential of SREBP2 and LXR as Therapeutic Targets.,"The brain is the organ with the highest cholesterol content in the body. Cholesterol in the brain plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of synapses and myelin sheaths to ensure normal brain function. Disruptions in cholesterol metabolism are closely associated with various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we explore the synthesis, regulation, transport, and functional roles of cholesterol in the CNS. We discuss in detail the associations between cholesterol homeostasis imbalance and CNS diseases including AD, HD, and MS, highlighting the significant role of cholesterol metabolism abnormalities in the development of these diseases. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP2) and liver X receptor (LXR) are two critical transcription factors that play central roles in cholesterol synthesis and reverse transport, respectively. Their cooperative interaction finely tunes the balance of brain cholesterol metabolism, presenting potential therapeutic value for preventing and treating CNS diseases. We particularly emphasize the alterations in SREBP2 and LXR under pathological conditions and their impacts on disease progression. This review summarizes current therapeutic agents targeting these two pathways, with the hope of broadening the perspectives of CNS drug developers and encouraging further study into SREBP2 and LXR-related therapies for CNS diseases.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40016526,Alzheimer's disease biological PET staging using plasma p217+tau.,"BACKGROUND: Plasma phospho-tau biomarkers, such as p217+tau, excel at identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. However, their ability to substitute for tau PET to identify AD biological stage is unclear.
METHODS: Participants included 248 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 227 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, with Janssen plasma p217+tau Simoa® assay, <sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694 Aβ-PET (A) and <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240 tau-PET (T) data. Biological PET stages were defined according to the Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of Alzheimer's Disease (2024): Initial (A + T-), Early (A + T<sub>MTL</sub> + ), Intermediate (A + T<sub>MOD</sub> + ), and Advanced (A + T<sub>HIGH</sub> + ). The threshold for A+ was 25 Centiloid and for T<sub>HIGH</sub> + , the 75th percentile SUVR<sub>temporo-parietal</sub> in A + CI. Sixty percent were A + , 36% Intermediate/Advanced, and 9% Advanced. The performance of p217+tau in discriminating AD stages was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Plasma p217+tau concentrations increase across the AD biological PET stages, except between Initial and Early stages. Screening for all AD stages (vs. A-T-), combined Intermediate/Advanced stages, or Advanced stage yields AUC of 0.92, 0.92, and 0.91, respectively (CI only: AUC 0.93, 0.89, 0.83). Plasma p217+tau Youden threshold provides sensitivity of 0.77 [0.73-0.90], specificity 0.91 [0.80-0.95], PPV 0.84 [0.71-0.89], and NPV 0.88 [0.85-0.93] for combined Intermediate/Advanced stages. For the Advanced stage alone, sensitivity is 0.89 [0.79-0.97], specificity 0.82 [0.75-0.9], NPV 0.99 [0.98-1.0], but PPV is only 0.33 [0.25-0.47].
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to accurately screening for A+ individuals, plasma p217+tau is useful for identifying a combined Intermediate/Advanced stage AD cohort or pre-screening to reduce the tau-PET required to identify Advanced stage AD individuals.",Commun Med (Lond),2025
40164697,Metagenomic analysis characterizes stage-specific gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a decade-long preclinical pathological period that can be divided into several stages. Emerging evidence has revealed that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in AD pathology. However, the role of gut microbiota in different AD stages has not been well characterized. In this study, we performed fecal shotgun metagenomic analysis on a Chinese cohort with 476 participants across five stages of AD pathology to characterize stage-specific alterations in gut microbiota and evaluate their diagnostic potential. We discovered extensive gut dysbiosis that is associated with neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation, with over 10% of microbial species and gene families showing significant alterations during AD progression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that microbial gene families exhibited strong diagnostic capabilities, evidenced by an average AUC of 0.80 in cross-validation and 0.75 in independent external validation. In the optimal model, the most discriminant gene families are primarily involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, energy, glycan and vitamins. We found that stage-specific microbial gene families in AD pathology could be validated by an in vitro gut simulator and were associated with specific genera. We also observed that the gut microbiota could affect the progression of cognitive decline in 5xFAD mice through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could be used for early intervention of AD. Our multi-stage large cohort metagenomic analysis demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota occur from the very early stages of AD pathology, offering important etiological and diagnostic insights.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
39956982,Exhaled breath is feasible for mild cognitive impairment detection: A diagnostic study with portable micro-gas chromatography.,"BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting 69 million individuals worldwide. At present, there is a lack of a community-applicable tool for MCI screening. Exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been used to distinguish MCI from cognitively normal (CN) individuals only in small sample size studies and the efficacy has not been compared with blood biomarkers.ObjectiveThis diagnostic study aimed to assess the feasibility of using exhaled breath VOCs detection by a portable micro-gas chromatography (μGC) device as a screening tool to discriminate MCI from CN individuals in a community population.MethodsA detection model was developed and optimized from five distinct machine learning algorithms based on the differential VOCs between 240 MCI and 241 CN individuals. Among these 481 participants, five plasma biomarkers were measured in 397 individuals (166 MCI and 231 CN).ResultsThe final model (481 individuals) incorporating eight differential VOCs showed good performance with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.83-0.85). The AUC of the VOC model (0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.90) was higher than that of the plasma model (0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.88) (397 individuals).ConclusionsThe detection of exhaled breath VOCs by a portable μGC device is feasible for MCI screening in community populations, potentially facilitating early detection and intervention strategies for individuals at high risk.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39691160,Associations of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms with amyloid burden in cognitively normal older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with the development of dementia. However, the link between PTSD and preclinical Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid β [Aβ]) remains controversial. Moreover, the correlation between the severity of PTSD with Aβ levels remains unknown.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study sought to investigate the associations of PTSD symptoms with global and regional brain Aβ burden. To this end, data were obtained from participants in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study. In addition, we explored the association between the severity of PTSD symptoms and Aβ levels.
RESULTS: A total of 4,228 participants aged 65 to 85 years were included in the final analysis. The results showed that PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with higher global Aβ levels (1.15 ± 0.20 vs. 1.09 ± 0.19; β = 0.056; p &lt; 0.001), after adjusting for covariates. The association between PTSD symptoms and Aβ levels was not affected by sex, age, ApoE genotype, or psychiatric diseases. Similarly, PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with Aβ levels in all subregions, including the anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, parietal cortex, precuneus, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex. In addition, the group with severe PTSD symptoms (1.22 ± 0.24) exhibited higher global Aβ levels than the groups with moderate (1.14 ± 0.19) or mild (1.12 ± 0.20) symptoms or the control (1.08 ± 0.18), with p &lt; 0.001.
CONCLUSION: The findings imply a close relationship between PTSD and brain Aβ levels, irrespective of sex, age, ApoE genotype, or psychiatric diseases. More well-designed studies are needed to further explore the relationship and mechanism underlying the association between PTSD and Aβ burden.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39888993,Monoaminergic neurotransmitters are bimodal effectors of tau aggregation.,"Neurotransmitters (NTs) mediate trans-synaptic signaling, and disturbances in their levels are linked to aging and brain disorders. Here, we ascribe an additional function for NTs in mediating intracellular protein aggregation by interaction with cytosolic protein fibrils. Cell-based seeding experiments revealed monoaminergic NTs as inhibitors of tau. Seeding is a disease-relevant mechanism involving catalysis by fibrils, leading to the aggregation of proteins in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Chemotyping small molecules with varied backbone structures revealed determinants of aggregation inhibitors and catalysts. Among those identified were monoaminergic NTs. Dose titrations revealed bimodal effects indicative of fibril disaggregation, with aggregation catalysis occurring at low ratios of NTs and inhibited seeding ensuing at higher concentrations. Bimodal effects by NTs extend from in vitro systems to dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that pharmacotherapies that modify intracellular NT levels could shape the neuronal protein aggregation environment.",Sci Adv,2025
40149496,Clinical Significance of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Mutations in Asian and Western Populations: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Background: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is primarily inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes being central contributors. Diagnosing Alzheimer's poses challenges due to the coexistence of various co-pathologies, and treatment options remain limited for most patients, apart from familial cases linked to specific genetic mutations. While significant research on Alzheimer's genetics has been conducted in both Asian and Caucasian populations, the specific mutations and their clinical impacts in EOAD are still inadequately explored. This review aims to provide a detailed analysis of commonly reported genetic mutations and associated clinical features in EOAD patients from Asian and Western populations.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic database search was conducted for studies published between 2016 and 2023. After screening 491 records, 36 studies from Asian cohorts and 40 from Western cohorts met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed 127 unique mutations in the Asian population and 190 in the Western population. About 16.7% of Asian and 21.9% of Western studies covered both familial and sporadic AD, with consistent patterns across groups. Some mutations were shared between the populations and displayed similar clinical features, while others were population-specific.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the considerable variability in EOAD mutations and phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing in younger patients to enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment strategies effectively.",Genes (Basel),2025
40138515,Associations between plasma complement C1q and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology in cognitively intact adults: The CABLE study.,"BackgroundC1q is a promoter of the classical pathway of complement and its massive expression may be associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationships between C1q and the major pathological challenges, including amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau deposition, remain undetermined in the preclinical AD phase.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the connections between plasma C1q and CSF AD biomarkers.MethodsThe cognitively intact participants (N = 1264) from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study were categorized into four groups, including Stage 0 [normal Amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>), Phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and Total-tau (T-tau)], Stage 1 (abnormal Aβ<sub>1-42,</sub> but normal P-tau or T-tau), Stage 2 (abnormal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and abnormal P-tau or T-tau), and suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology (SNAP) (abnormal P-tau or T-tau, but normal amyloid levels). The changes in plasma C1q levels among these groups and the correlation between C1q levels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers were performed.ResultsThe results demonstrated plasma C1q levels are lower in Stage 0 (p = 0.010) and SNAP (p &lt; 0.001) compared with Stage 1. A significant association between C1q levels and CSF AD pathology, including Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (β = -0.143, p &lt; 0.001), Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>/Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> (β = -0.173, p &lt; 0.001), P-tau/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (β = 0.156, p &lt; 0.001), and T-tau/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (β = 0.130, p &lt; 0.001) has been identified.ConclusionsThe current research elucidates a positive correlation between elevated plasma C1q levels and CSF Aβ pathology, with C1q amplifying concomitantly with the pathological and clinical progression of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39707519,pTau pathology in the retina of TAU58 mice: association with ganglion cell degeneration and implications on seeding and propagation of pTau from human brain lysates.,"The accumulation of abnormal phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau) in neurons of the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PTau pathology also occurs in the retina of AD cases. Accordingly, questions arise whether retinal pTau can act as a potential seed for inducing cerebral pTau pathology and whether retinal pTau pathology causes degeneration of retinal neurons. To address these questions, we (1) characterized pTau pathology in the retina of TAU58 mice, (2) determined the impact of pTau pathology on retinal ganglion cell density, and (3) used this mouse model to test whether brain lysates from AD and/or non-AD control cases induce seeding in the retina and/or propagation into the brain. TAU58 mice developed retinal pTau pathology at 6 months of age, increasing in severity and extent with age. TAU58 mice showed reduced retinal ganglion cell density compared to wild-type mice, which declined with age and pTau pathology progression. Brain lysates from non-AD Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage I controls increased retinal pTau pathology after subretinal injection compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) but did not accelerate pTau pathology in the brain. In contrast, subretinally injected AD brain lysates accelerated pTau pathology in the retina and the contralateral superior colliculus. Subretinal injection of AD brain lysates, but not of non-AD brain, induced in this context a neuroinflammatory response in the retina and in the contralateral primary visual cortex. These results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Brain lysates from AD and non-AD sources can accelerate tauopathy within the retina. (2) The anterograde propagation of pTau pathology from the retina to the brain can be triggered by subretinal injections of AD brain lysates. (3) Such subretinal injections also provoke a neuroinflammatory response in both the retina and the visual cortex. (4) The accumulation of retinal pTau is associated with the degeneration of the involved ganglion cells, indicating that retinal tauopathy might contribute to vision impairment in the elderly and underscore the retina's potential role in spreading tau pathology to the brain.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2024
39716329,Data-driven CSF biomarker profiling: imaging and clinical outcomes in a cohort at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and glial response, complementing Alzheimer's disease (AD) core biomarkers, have improved the pathophysiological characterization of the disease. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the co-expression of multiple CSF biomarkers will help the identification of AD-like phenotypes when biomarker positivity thresholds are not met yet.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy cognitively unimpaired adults with family history (FH) of sporadic AD (mean age = 60.6 ± 4.85 years, 64.8% women) underwent lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 266) and positron emission tomography imaging (n = 239) protocols, and clinical evaluations. CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>40</sub>, p-tau<sub>181</sub>, p-tau<sub>217,</sub> p-tau<sub>231,</sub> NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, S100, α-Synuclein, SYT1, and SNAP25 were measured. Participants were clustered based on CSF biomarker co-expression with an agglomerative algorithm. The predictive value of the classification against brain and cognitive outcomes was evaluated.
RESULTS: Three clusters (C) were identified. Higher Aβ burden and CSF p-tau was the hallmark of C1. The other two clusters showed lower Aβ burden but higher expression of glial (C2) or synaptic markers (C3). Participants in C1 showed an AD-like clinical phenotype, comprising participants with the overall highest percentage of two parent FH and APOE-ε4 carriers, in addition to comprising more females compared to C2. C3 displayed better vascular health compared to C1. C2 were older and comprised a lower percentage of females compared to C3. C1 showed an AD-like gray matter reduction in medial temporal (notably hippocampus) and frontal regions that were not observed in Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> + compared with Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> - . Furthermore, Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> - participants in C1 showed GM reduction in inferior temporal areas compared with Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> + participants overall. C1 membership also predicted cognitive decline in executive function, but not memory, beyond Aβ + status, overall suggesting a better prognosis in Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> + participants without C1 membership. Additionally, C1 displayed a higher rate of conversion to Aβ + (25%) over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that examining multiple CSF biomarkers reflecting diverse pathological pathways may complement and/or outperform AD core biomarkers and thresholding approaches to identify individuals showing a clinical and cognitive AD-like phenotype, including higher conversion to Aβ + , GM reductions and cognitive decline. The clinical utility of this approach warrants further investigation and replication in other cohorts.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39834257,Exploring predementia: Understanding the characteristics of subjective cognitive decline plus from India.,"BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the early predementia syndrome. that occurs even before the development of objective cognitive decline. SCD plus refers to an additional set of criteria that increases the likelihood of developing mild cognitive impairment and further progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studying the progression of SCD-plus participants will help in understanding the importance of diagnosing this condition at an early stage and delaying its onset.
OBJECTIVE: The present tries to examine neurocognitive changes in individuals who met the criteria of SCD-plus patients. The study also investigated the imaging correlates of these individuals in both cohorts.
METHODS: This study included 94 participants from Srinivaspura Aging, Neuro Senescence, and COGnition (SANSCOG) and Tata Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA) cohorts who satisfy the criteria of SCD plus. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the SCD plus participants and healthy controls. Regression analysis was performed to find the association between SCD plus and cognition.
RESULTS: The SCD-plus group performed poorer than the healthy group in episodic memory delayed recall (p = 0.049), name face recognition (p = 0.023), and letter fluency (p = 0.004) tasks. The generalized linear model revealed that the SCD-plus group had lower left cerebellar cortex (p = 0.010) and right inferior occipital cortex (p = 0.016) volumes than the healthy control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The participants in the SCD-plus group performed poorly on memory and language-related tasks, and the volumes of the associated brain regions decreased. This study suggested that the SCD-plus group had characteristics similar to AD group and can help in identifying AD at the earliest.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39791216,Predicting cognitive decline from neuropsychiatric symptoms and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: A machine learning approach to a population-based data.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the potential added value of including neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in machine learning (ML) models, along with demographic features and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, to predict decline or non-decline in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of adding NPS to AD biomarkers on ML model accuracy in predicting cognitive decline among older adults.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the setting of the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, including participants aged ≥ 50 years with information on demographics (i.e., age, sex, education), NPS (i.e., Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire; Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories), at least one AD biomarker (i.e., plasma-, neuroimaging- and/or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]-derived), and at least 2 repeated neuropsychological assessments. We trained and tested ML models using a stepwise feature addition approach to predict decline versus non-decline in global and domain-specific (i.e., memory, language, visuospatial, and attention/executive function) cognitive scores.
RESULTS: ML models had better performance when NPS were included along with a) neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting decline in global cognition, as well as language and visuospatial skills; b) plasma-derived biomarkers for predicting decline in visuospatial skills; and c) CSF-derived biomarkers for predicting decline in attention/executive function, language, and memory.
CONCLUSIONS: NPS, added to ML models including demographic and AD biomarker data, improves prediction of downward trajectories in global and domain-specific cognitive scores among community-dwelling older adults, albeit effect sizes are small. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed by future cohort studies.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

39886067,Evaluating conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease with structural MRI: a machine learning study.,"Alzheimer's disease is a disabling neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective treatment currently exists. To predict the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease could be crucial for patients' outcome, but current Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are invasive, time consuming or expensive. Thus, developing MRI-based computational methods for Alzheimer's disease early diagnosis would be essential to narrow down the phenotypic measures predictive of cognitive decline. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is associated with higher risk for Alzheimer's disease, and here, we aimed to identify MRI-based quantitative rules to predict aMCI to possible Alzheimer's disease conversion, applying different machine learning algorithms sequentially. At baseline, T1-weighted brain images were collected for 104 aMCI patients and processed to obtain 146 volumetric measures of cerebral grey matter regions [regions of interest (ROIs)]. One year later, patients were classified as converters (aMCI-c = 32) or non-converters, i.e. clinically and neuropsychologically stable (aMCI-s = 72) based on cognitive performance. Feature selection was performed by random forest (RF), and the identified seven ROIs volumetric data were used to implement support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Both SVM and DT reached an average accuracy of 86% in identifying aMCI-c and aMCI-s. DT found a critical threshold volume of the right entorhinal cortex (EC-r) as the first feature for differentiating aMCI-c/aMCI-s. Almost all aMCI-c had an EC-r volume &lt;1286 mm<sup>3</sup>, while more than half of the aMCI-s patients had a volume above the identified threshold for this structure. Other key regions for the classification between aMCI-c/aMCI-s were the left lateral occipital (LOC-l), the middle temporal gyrus and the temporal pole cortices. Our study reinforces previous evidence suggesting that the morphometry of the EC-r and LOC-l best predicts aMCI to Alzheimer's disease conversion. Further investigations are needed prior to deeming our findings as a broadly applicable predictive framework. However, here, a first indication was derived for volumetric thresholds that, being easy to obtain, may assist in early identification of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice, thus contributing to establishing MRI as a useful non-invasive prognostic instrument for dementia onset.",Brain Commun,2025
39920176,Longitudinal characterization reveals behavioral impairments in aged APP knock in mouse models.,"APP knock-in (KI) mice serve as an exciting new model system to understand amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, overcoming many of the limitations of previous overexpression-based model systems. The APP<sup>SAA</sup> mouse model (containing the humanized APP with three familial Alzheimer's disease mutations) and the APP<sup>WT</sup> control (containing wildtype humanized APP) are the first commercially available APP KI mice within the United States. While APP<sup>SAA</sup> mice have been shown to develop progressive Aβ pathology and neuroinflammation, the age at which behavioral and cognitive impairments begin to develop has yet to be described. Therefore, we performed an in-depth longitudinal study over 16 months, assessing cognition in these two strains, as well as assessments of motor function. While no cognitive deficits are observed in either genotype throughout the first year of life, 16-month-old APP<sup>SAA</sup>, but not APP<sup>WT</sup> mice show initial signs of spatial memory decline. In addition, both genotypes display impaired motor function at the same age. Together, this data identifies a timeframe where behavioral deficits appear, providing an essential foundation for future studies using these model systems.",Sci Rep,2025
39879839,Inter-network functional connectivity increases by beta-amyloid and may facilitate the early stage of tau accumulation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically marked by tau tangles and beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques. It has been hypothesized that Aβ facilitates spread of tau outside of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), but exact mechanism of this facilitation remains unclear. We aimed to test the hypothesis that abnormal Aβ induces an increase in inter-network functional connectivity, which in turn induces early-stage tau elevation in limbic network. Our study used 18F-Florbetaben Aβ positron emission tomography (PET), 18F-MK6240 tau-PET, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) from 489 healthy unimpaired older adults, including 46 with longitudinal data. We found significant correlations between tau in limbic network and Aβ in distinct functional networks. We then demonstrated that Aβ+ /Tau- participants exhibited elevated inter-network functional connectivity of the limbic network. Finally, our longitudinal results showed that annual increases in inter-network functional connectivity between limbic network and default mode and control networks were linked to annual tau elevation in limbic network, primarily modulated by Aβ+ individuals. Understanding this early brain alteration in response to pathologies could guide treatments early in disease course.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39717349,Therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease: a critical appraisal.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Mutations in genes and precursors of β amyloid (Aβ) are found in the familial form of the disease. This led to the evaluation of seven monoclonal antibodies against Aβ in subjects with AD, two of which were approved for use by the FDA. They caused only a small improvement in cognitive function, probably because they were given to those with much more prevalent sporadic forms of dementia. They also have potentially serious adverse effects. Oxidative stress and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines are present in all subjects with AD and are well correlated with the degree of memory impairment. Drugs that affect these processes include TNFα blocking antibodies and MAPK p38 inhibitors that reduce cognitive impairment when given for other inflammatory conditions. However, their adverse effects and inability to penetrate the brain preclude their use for dementia. Rosiglitazone is used to treat diabetes, a risk factor for AD, but failed in a clinical trial because it was given to subjects that already had dementia. Ladostigil reduces oxidative stress and suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from activated microglia without blocking their effects. Chronic oral administration to aging rats prevented the decline in memory and suppressed overexpression of genes adversely affecting synaptic function in relevant brain regions. In a phase 2 trial, ladostigil reduced the decline in short-term memory and in whole brain and hippocampal volumes in human subjects with mild cognitive impairment and had no more adverse effects than placebo.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39884585,"S100A9 protein activates microglia and stimulates phagocytosis, resulting in synaptic and neuronal loss.","S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9, also known as calgranulin B) is expressed and secreted by myeloid cells under inflammatory conditions, and S100A9 can amplify inflammation. There is a large increase in S100A9 expression in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and S100A9 has been suggested to contribute to neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here we investigated the effects of extracellular recombinant S100A9 protein on microglia, neurons and synapses in primary rat brain neuronal-glial cell cultures. Incubation of cell cultures with 250-500 nM S100A9 caused neuronal loss without signs of apoptosis or necrosis, but accompanied by exposure of the ""eat-me"" signal - phosphatidylserine on neurons. S100A9 caused activation of microglial inflammation as evidenced by an increase in the microglial number, morphological changes, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased phagocytic activity. At lower concentrations, 10-100 nM S100A9 induced synaptic loss in the cultures. Depletion of microglia from the cultures prevented S100A9-induced neuronal and synaptic loss, indicating that neuronal and synaptic loss was mediated by microglia. These results suggest that extracellular S100A9 may contribute to neurodegeneration by activating microglial inflammation and phagocytosis, resulting in loss of synapses and neurons. This further suggests the possibility that neurodegeneration may be reduced by targeting S100A9 or microglia.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
40164726,Plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker identifies tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Insoluble tau aggregates within neurofibrillary tangles are a defining neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and closely correlate with clinical symptoms. Although tau pathology can be assessed using tau positron emission tomography, a more accessible biomarker is needed for diagnosis, prognosis and tracking treatment effects. Here we present a new plasma tau species, the endogenously cleaved, microtubule-binding region containing residue 243 (eMTBR-tau243), which specifically reflects tau tangle pathology. Across the AD spectrum in three different cohorts (n = 108, 55 and 739), plasma eMTBR-tau243 levels were significantly elevated at the mild cognitive impairment stage and increased further in dementia. Plasma eMTBR-tau243 showed strong associations with tau positron emission tomography binding (β = 0.72, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) and cognitive performance (β = 0.60, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.40), outperforming other plasma tau (%p-tau217 and %p-tau205) biomarkers. These results suggest that plasma eMTBR-tau243 may be useful for estimating the tauopathy load in AD, thereby improving the diagnostic evaluation of AD in clinical practice and monitoring the efficacy of tau-targeted therapies in clinical trials.",Nat Med,2025
39994980,Identification of the enzymatic cleavage relationship between anti-aging protein α-Klotho and Alzheimer's disease biomarker BACE1.,"BackgroundThe α-Klotho is known to be involved in longevity and various age-related diseases, including cognitive impairment. BACE1, an important enzyme associated with the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), serves as a biomarker for predicting changes in cognitive function. Although both proteins are closely linked to age-related cognitive function, the mechanism of their interaction remains unclear.ObjectiveTo identify the enzymatic digestion relation between α-Klotho and BACE1 and the specific cleavage site.MethodsThirty elderly and forty-five young individuals were recruited. The cleavage product was identified by Coomassie blue staining, western blot, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The concentrations of plasma proteins were measured by ELISA.ResultsA new protein product was identified after the digestion reaction. BACE1 cleaved the α-Klotho peptide 951-981 at the F-T residues. When the F-T residues were replaced with K-K, BACE1 was unable to cleave the mutant peptide. The plasma levels of α-Klotho were significantly lower in elderly participants than in young participants (p < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in plasma BACE1 levels between elderly and young participants (p = 0.164). In elderly adults, there was a significant positive correlation between plasma BACE1 and α-Klotho protein levels (p = 0.009, r = 0.469), while this correlation was not observed in young adults (p = 0.170, r = -0.208).ConclusionsThe anti-aging protein α-Klotho is a substrate of BACE1 with a specific cleavage site at F-T. The BACE1/α-Klotho pathway may serve as a common axis for age-related cognitive decline.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39956592,"Resilience-promoting social networks among unpaid dementia caregivers: protocol for a mixed-methods, 2-year exploratory study.","INTRODUCTION: Unpaid caregivers of people living with dementia often experience lower levels of perceived life satisfaction and higher rates of depression and anxiety compared with those caring for individuals without Alzheimer's disease or related dementias. While research on unpaid caregiver well-being and satisfaction has primarily focused on the characteristics of people living with dementia and their dyadic relationships, it has not adequately explored the role of social networks in supporting unpaid caregiver well-being. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by taking an egocentric social network approach to understand the multiple dimensions of social relations among unpaid caregivers of people living with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a mixed-method, 2-year exploratory study that involves a structured survey-based telephone interview in year 1 and semistructured interviews in year 2 with caregivers of PLWD recruited through community and healthcare partners. Participants will participate in 1 60-min interview in year 1 (n=100) and a 45-60 min semistructured interview in year 2 (n=75). Eligibility for caregivers includes being an unpaid caregiver, aged 40 years or older, residing and providing care in Arizona or Nevada. The survey consists of questions about caregiver and care recipient demographics, caregiver background, caregiver stress, resilience, well-being and egocentric social network data. Network composition attributes, such as tie strength, the function of the relationship and reliance on network members, will also be assessed. In year 2, qualitative semistructured interviews will supplement these quantitative measures to understand network selection, perceived network changes over time and network strength.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Arizona State Institutional Review Board (00018191) approved this study. All participants will receive electronic informed consent documents to review and sign. During the initial interview, participants will be asked if they have any questions about the informed consent documents. We will confirm that participants have completed the required consent form before the start of any research activity. The findings of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles, academic and community presentations, and community-focused publications targeting caregivers.",BMJ Open,2025
40185916,Exome sequencing of a Portuguese cohort of early-onset Alzheimer's disease implicates the X-linked lysosomal gene GLA.,"Cerebrovascular disease is a common comorbidity in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of the cerebral vasculature and AD neuropathology interact in multiple ways. Additionally, common variants in COL4A1 and rare variants in HTRA1, NOTCH3, COL4A1, and CST3 have been associated with AD pathogenesis. We aimed to search for rare genetic variants in genes associated with monogenic small vessel disease in a cohort of Portuguese early-onset AD patients. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 104 thoroughly studied patients with early-onset AD who lacked known pathogenic variants in the genes associated with AD or frontotemporal dementia. We searched for rare (minor allele frequency < 0.001) non-synonymous variants in genes associated with small vessel disease: NOTCH3, HTRA1, COL4A1, COL4A2, CSTA, GLA, and TREX1. We identified 12 rare variants in 18 patients (17.3% of the cohort). Three male AD patients carried a pathogenic GLA variant (p.Arg118Cys). One of these patients had a definite neuropathological study, confirming the diagnosis of AD and showing concomitant Fabry pathology in CA1-CA4 and the subiculum. We also found several rare variants in other genes associated with cSVD (NOTCH3, COL4A2 and HTRA1), corroborating previous studies and providing further support for the possibility that cSVD genes may play a role in AD pathogenesis. The presence of the same GLA variant in 3 early-onset AD patients, with no other genetic cause for the disease, together with the colocalization of Fabry disease pathology in areas relevant for AD pathogenesis, suggest GLA may have a role in its pathophysiology, possibly parallel to that of GBA in Parkinson's disease, meriting further studies.",Sci Rep,2025
40194235,Frequency of Quality Care in Dementia With Lewy Bodies in Cohorts With and Without Specialty Care (P6-3.012).,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of quality care in moderate-advanced dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), including in individuals with and without specialty care.
BACKGROUND: DLB is a common degenerative dementia, however the frequency of high-quality care is unknown.
DESIGN/METHODS: Dyads of moderate-advanced DLB patients and their caregivers were recruited from DLB Centers of Excellence, advocacy organizations, or research registries. Caregivers completed questionnaires regarding demographics, healthcare, and ancillary referrals. Descriptive statistics report the frequency of care aligning with dementia and parkinsonism quality measures. Secondary analyses compared specialty and non-specialty care via chi-square and t-tests. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing.
RESULTS: Of 189 dyads, patients were on average 75±8 years-old (77.8% male, 95.2% White, average time since diagnosis 3.2 ± 3.1 years). Forty percent of participants reported care from a movement or dementia specialist, 34% from a DLB specialist, and 51% from general neurology. 132 (69.8%) patients were taking a cholinesterase inhibitor. The average Anticholinergic Burden (ACB) score was 2.0±2.0. Of 84 patients taking antipsychotic medications, 74 (39.2%) were taking preferred antipsychotics and 10 (5.3%) were taking non-preferred antipsychotics. Eighty-eight participants (46.6%) reported rehabilitation (PT/OT/SLP) referrals, 49 (25.9%) social work referrals, 17 (9%) palliative care, and 22 (11.6%) hospice. There were no differences in cholinesterase inhibitor use (p=0.061), mean ACB score (p=0.348), use of preferred (p=0.560) or non-preferred (p=0.230) antipsychotics, rehabilitation referrals (p=0.719), or hospice referrals (p=0.928) between specialty and non-specialty cohorts. Individuals receiving specialty care were less likely to receive social work (13.9% vs. 34%), p=0.001) and palliative care (3.8% vs. 12.7%, p=0.034) referrals.
CONCLUSIONS: Most individuals with moderate-advanced DLB observed received quality care relating to medications and rehabilitation referrals, however frequency of social work and palliative care referrals were low across both specialty and non-specialty cohorts. There is a need to increase availability of these services and connect individuals with DLB to these supports.

39885298,Synaptic vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathologies differentially disrupts emotional and memory neural circuits.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies, but whether and how these factors differentially disrupt neural circuits remains unclear. Here, we investigated the vulnerability of memory and emotional circuits to Aβ and tau pathologies in mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP), Tau or both APP/Tau in excitatory neurons. APP/Tau mice develop age- and sex-dependent Aβ and phosphorylated tau pathologies, the latter exacerbated at early stages, in vulnerable brain regions. Early memory deficits were associated with hippocampal tau pathology in Tau and APP/Tau mice, whereas anxiety and fear appeared linked to intracellular Aβ in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of APP and APP/Tau mice. Transcriptome hippocampal profiling revealed gene changes affecting myelination and RNA processing in Tau mice, and inflammation and synaptic-related pathways in APP/Tau mice at 6 months. At 9 months, we detected common and region-specific changes in astrocytic, microglia and 63 AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and BLA of APP/Tau mice. Spatial learning deficits were associated with synaptic tau accumulation and synapse disruption in the hippocampus of Tau and APP/Tau mice, whereas emotional disturbances were linked to Aβ pathology but not synaptic tau in the BLA. Interestingly, Aβ and tau exhibited synergistic detrimental effects in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus but they counteract with each other to mitigate LTP impairments in the amygdala. These findings indicate that Aβ and tau pathologies cause region-specific effects and synergize to induce synaptic dysfunction and immune responses, contributing to the differing vulnerability of memory and emotional neural circuits in AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40114266,The role of n-3-derived specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in microglial mitochondrial respiration and inflammation resolution in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia globally and is characterised by reduced mitochondrial respiration and cortical deposition of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyper-phosphorylated tau. Despite its characterisation more than 110 years ago, the mechanisms by which AD develops are still unclear. Dysregulation of microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β may play a key role. Microglia are the major innate immune cell of the central nervous system and are critical responders to pro-inflammatory states. Typically, microglia react with a short-lived inflammatory response. However, a dysregulation in the resolution of this microglial response results in the chronic release of inflammatory mediators. This prolongs the state of neuroinflammation, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the microglial specialised pro-resolving mediator (SPM) contribution to phagocytosis of amyloid-β is dysregulated in AD. SPMs are derivatives of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and potentially represent a strategic target for protection against AD progression. However, there is little understanding of how mitochondrial respiration in microglia may be sustained long term by n-3-derived SPMs, and how this affects their clearance of amyloid-β. Here, we re-evaluate the current literature on SPMs in AD and propose that SPMs may improve phagocytosis of amyloid-β by microglia as a result of sustained mitochondrial respiration and allowing a pro-resolution response.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39767701,Exploration of Novel Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Diseases Using Proteomic Analysis and Ligand-Binding Assays.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and their public health burden continues to increase. There is an urgent need to develop reliable and sensitive biomarkers to aid the timely diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic development for neurodegenerative disorders. Proteomic screening strategies, including antibody microarrays, are a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, but their findings should be confirmed using quantitative assays. The current study explored the feasibility of combining an exploratory proteomic strategy and confirmatory ligand-binding assays to screen for and validate biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders.
METHODS: It analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis and healthy controls using an exploratory antibody microarray and validatory ligand-binding assays.
RESULTS: The screening antibody microarray identified differentially expressed proteins between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls, including cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), osteopontin, and vascular endothelial growth factor 165b. Quantitative ligand-binding assays confirmed that CD14 levels were elevated in CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (p = 0.0177), whereas osteopontin levels were increased in CSF of patients with Parkinson's disease (p = 0.0346).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated the potential utility of combining an exploratory proteomic approach and quantitative ligand-binding assays to identify biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. To further validate and expand these findings, large-scale analyses using well-characterized samples should be conducted.",Biomedicines,2024
39917849,Early metabolic changes in the brain of Alzheimer's disease rats are driven by GLAST+ cells.,"Glucose metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and is used to diagnose the disease or predict imminent cognitive decline. The main method to measure brain metabolism in vivo is positron emission tomography with 2-Deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET). The cellular origin of changes in the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET signal in AD is controversial. We addressed this by combining [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET with subsequent cell-sorting and γ-counting of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-accumulation in sorted cell populations. 7-month-old male TgF344-AD rats and wild-type controls (n = 24/group) received sham or ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg) injection prior to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET imaging to increase glutamate uptake and glucose utilisation. The same animals were injected again one week later, and radiolabelled brains were dissected, with hippocampi taken for magnetically-activated cell sorting of radioligand-treated tissues (MACS-RTT). Radioactivity in sorted cell populations was measured to quantify cell-specific [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake. Transcriptional analyses of metabolic enzymes/transporters were also performed. Hypometabolism in the frontal association cortex of TgF344-AD rats was identified using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET, whereas hypermetabolism was identified in the hippocampus using MACS-RTT. Hypermetabolism was primarily driven by GLAST+ cells. This was supported by transcriptional analyses which showed alteration to metabolic apparatus, including upregulation of hexokinase 2 and altered expression of glucose/lactate transporters.

40033783,Measures of retinal health successfully capture risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at midlife.,"BACKGROUND: Identification of at-risk individuals who would benefit from early intervention for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical as new treatments are developed. Measures of retinal health could offer accessible and low-cost indication of pre-morbid disease risk, but their association with ADRD risk is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether midlife retinal neuronal and microvascular measures are associated with ADRD risk-index scores and individual domains of ADRD risk.
METHODS: Data were from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-representative longitudinal New Zealand-based birth cohort study. 94.1% (N = 938) of living Study members were seen at age 45 (2017-2019). Retinal neuronal (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL)) and microvascular (arterioles and venules) measures were used as predictors. Outcome measures were four top ADRD risk indexes (CAIDE, LIBRA, Lancet, and ADU-ADRI), and a comprehensive midlife ADRD risk index, the DunedinARB.
RESULTS: Poorer retinal microvascular health (narrower arterioles and wider venules) was associated with greater ADRD risk (βs = 0.16-0.31; ps &lt; 0.001). Thinner RNFL was modestly associated with higher ADRD risk (βs = 0.05-0.08; ps = 0.02-0.13). Follow-up tests of distinct domains of ADRD risk indicated that while RNFL associations reflected cardiometabolic risk only, microvascular measures were associated with diverse ADRD risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Measures of retinal health, particularly microvascular measures, successfully capture ADRD risk across several domains of known risk factors, even at the young midlife age of 45 years. Retinal microvascular imaging may be an accessible, scalable, and relatively low-cost method of assessing ADRD risk among middle-aged adults.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39893498,Multi-omics analyses identify gut microbiota-fecal metabolites-brain-cognition pathways in the Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but our understanding of the molecular and neuropathological bases underlying such association remains fragmentary.
METHODS: Using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, we examined group differences in gut microbiome, fecal metabolome, neuroimaging measures, and cognitive variables across 30 patients with AD, 75 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 61 healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we assessed the associations between these multi-omics changes using correlation and mediation analyses.
RESULTS: There were significant group differences in gut microbial composition, which were driven by 8 microbial taxa (e.g., Staphylococcus and Bacillus) exhibiting a progressive increase in relative abundance from HC to MCI to AD, and 2 taxa (e.g., Anaerostipes) showing a gradual decrease. 26 fecal metabolites (e.g., Arachidonic, Adrenic, and Lithocholic acids) exhibited a progressive increase from HC to MCI to AD. We also observed progressive gray matter atrophy in broadly distributed gray matter regions and gradual micro-structural integrity damage in widespread white matter tracts along the AD continuum. Integration of these multi-omics changes revealed significant associations between microbiota, metabolites, neuroimaging, and cognition. More importantly, we identified two potential mediation pathways: (1) microbiota → metabolites → neuroimaging → cognition, and (2) microbiota → metabolites → cognition.
CONCLUSION: Aside from elucidating the underlying mechanism whereby gut microbiota dysbiosis is linked to AD, our findings may contribute to groundwork for future interventions targeting the microbiota-metabolites-brain-cognition pathways as a therapeutic strategy in the AD continuum.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025

39871402,Physical Exercise Decreases Complement-Mediated Synaptic Loss and Protects Against Cognitive Impairment by Inhibiting Microglial Tmem9-ATP6V0D1 in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Physical exercise is known to slow synaptic neurodegeneration and cognitive aging in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The benefits of physical exercise are related to reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and increased synaptic plasticity. Yet little is known about the mechanisms that mediate these effects. Here, we show that physical exercise down-regulated the microglial Tmem9 protein, inhibited C1q activation, and decreased C1q-dependent microglial synapse engulfment, eventually ameliorating cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, using oAβ cultured-BV2 in vitro, we show that downregulation of microglial Tmem9 was sufficient to restrain complement activity and decrease microglia-mediated synaptic loss, whereas overexpression of microglial Tmem9 tended to promote complement activation and induced synaptic loss, abolishing exercise-associated protection. Finally, we show that microglial Tmem9 contributed to complement activation by regulating ATP6V0D1, a vesicular (H<sup>+</sup>) ATP-dependent proton pump (V-ATPase) subunit that regulates V-ATPase assembly. Together, our results demonstrate that exercise is a potential treatment for AD patients. In an AD mouse model, it decreased the levels of microglial Tmem9 to inhibit the activation of complement, alleviated complement-dependent synaptic loss, and eventually ameliorated emotional and cognitive disorders.",Aging Cell,2025
39764088,Impaired Cerebrospinal Fluid Lipoprotein-Mediated Cholesterol Delivery to Neurons in Alzheimer's Disease.,"In the central nervous system, apolipoprotein (APO) E-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles mediate the transport of glial-derived cholesterol to neurons, which is essential for neuronal membrane remodeling and maintenance of the myelin sheath. Despite this, the role of HDL-like cholesterol trafficking on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We aimed to examine cholesterol transport via HDL-like particles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients compared to control individuals. Additionally, we explored the ability of reconstituted HDL containing different APOE isoforms to regulate cholesterol transport. We evaluated the capacity of CSF HDL-like particles to facilitate radiolabeled unesterified cholesterol efflux from A172 human glioblastoma astrocytes and to deliver cholesterol to SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells. The HDL-like proteome in the AD and control groups was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Reconstituted HDL nanoparticles were prepared by combining phospholipids and cholesterol with human APOE3 or APOE4, followed by radiolabeling with unesterified cholesterol. Our results showed that cholesterol efflux from astrocytes to CSF were similar between AD patients and controls, both under baseline conditions and after activation of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1. However, CSF HDL-like particle-mediated neuronal cholesterol uptake was significantly reduced in the AD group. LC-MS/MS analysis identified 775 proteins associated with HDL-like particles in both groups, with no major alterations in proteins linked to cholesterol metabolism. However, 27 proteins involved in non-cholesterol-related processes were differentially expressed. Notably, synthetic reconstituted HDL particles containing APOE4 exhibited reduced capacity to deliver cholesterol to neurons compared to those with APOE3. These findings indicate that CSF HDL-like particles from patients with AD demonstrate impaired cholesterol delivery to neurons. Our study highlights APOE4 as a critical contributor to abnormal neuronal cholesterol uptake in AD pathophysiology.",Res Sq,2024
39834554,The role of CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 axis in cognitive impairment associated with neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive impairment (CI). The: Cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine ligand 12(CXCL12)/CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/CXC chemokine receptor type 7 (CXCR7) axis has emerged as a critical molecular pathway in the development of CI in these disorders. This review explores the role of this axis in the pathogenesis of CI across these neurodegenerative diseases, synthesizing current evidence and its implications for targeted therapies. In AD, dysregulation of this axis contributes to amyloid-β accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. PD studies reveal that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling influences dopaminergic neuron survival and microglial activation, affecting cognitive function. In MS, the axis modulates neuroinflammation and demyelination processes, impacting cognitive performance. ALS research indicates that the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 pathway is involved in motor neuron degeneration and associated cognitive deficits. Across these diseases, the axis influences neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival through various signaling cascades, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that modulating this axis could provide neuroprotective effects and potentially alleviate cognitive symptoms. This review highlights the potential of the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 axis as a therapeutic target for addressing CI in neurodegenerative diseases. It also underscores the need for further research to fully elucidate its role and develop effective interventions, potentially leading to improved clinical management strategies for these devastating disorders.",Brain Behav Immun Health,2025
39730451,Interpretable machine learning-driven biomarker identification and validation for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by limited effective treatments, underscoring the critical need for early detection and diagnosis to improve intervention outcomes. This study integrates various bioinformatics methodologies with interpretable machine learning to identify reliable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and construction of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks, we meticulously analyzed the AD dataset from the GEO database to pinpoint Hub genes. Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms were employed to construct diagnostic models, which were then elucidated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To visualize our findings, we generated an insightful bioinformatics map of 10 Hub genes. We then conducted experimental validation on less-studied Hub genes, revealing significant differential mRNA expression of MYH9 and RHOQ in an AD cell model. Finally, we explored the biological significance of these two genes at the single-cell transcriptome level. This study not only introduces interactive SHAP panels for precise decision-making in AD but also offers novel insights into the identification of AD biomarkers through interpretable machine learning diagnostic models. Particularly, MYH9 has emerged as a promising new potential biomarker, pointing the way towards enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized therapeutic strategies for AD. Although the mRNA expression patterns of RHOQ are opposite in AD cell models and human brain tissue samples, the role of RHOQ in AD remains worthy of further exploration due to the diversity and complexity of biological molecular regulation.",Sci Rep,2024
40118994,Classification method based on surf and sift features for alzheimer diagnosis using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementia in the elderly, poses a challenge for early diagnosis due to its progressive nature and hidden microstructural changes. While traditional T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> weighted MRI can assess macro-structural brain atrophy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) unveils these hidden microstructural alterations. This study explores the use of DTI data, specifically visual patterns in Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD) maps, to characterize AD progression. This paper proposes a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework employing SIFT and SURF descriptors and a bag-of-words approach to build AD-specific signatures for the hippocampus region, known to be heavily affected by the disease. These signatures are extracted from MD, FA, and RD maps and used to differentiate between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal controls (NC) in both multiclass and binary classification scenarios. Additionally, we investigate late fusion of visual map features for enhanced decision-making. The experiments were accomplished with a subset of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset formed of AD patients (n = 35), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) (n = 6), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) (n = 24) and cognitively healthy elderly Normal Controls (NC) (n = 31). Promising preliminary results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system as a useful tool to capture the AD leanness with achieving accuracies of 87.5%, 87.4%, 89%, and 95.2% for MD, FA, RD, and fusion of features respectively for the multiclass system using SIFT features. Using FA features for binary discrimination achieves 97.5%. Moreover, the fusion based on the decision level model reached an accuracy of 93.3% AD/MCI, 95.7% AD/NC, and 93.3% MCI/NC (96.2 ± 3.6 MCI vs. NC, 97.5 ± 5 AD vs. NC). Furthermore, fusion of features led to a noteworthy precision boost of 96%. These findings suggest that our DTI-based CAD framework holds promise as a reliable and accurate tool for capturing AD progression, paving the way for earlier diagnosis and potentially improved patient outcomes.",Sci Rep,2025
40172303,Modified titration of donanemab reduces ARIA risk and maintains amyloid reduction.,"INTRODUCTION: TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 (NCT05738486) is a multicenter, double-blind, ongoing phase 3b study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Participants (n = 843) were randomized 1:1:1:1 (standard + three alternative donanemab dosing arms). Primary outcome was relative risk reduction (RRR) of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/effusions (ARIA-E) at 24 weeks assessed with Bayesian logistic regression. Amyloid plaque levels by positron emission tomography and serum donanemab pharmacokinetics were measured.
RESULTS: ARIA-E frequencies for standard, modified titration, dose skipping, and C<sub>max</sub> arms were 23.7%, 13.7%, 18.6%, and 18.3%, respectively, at 24 weeks and similar at 52 weeks: 24.2%, 15.6%, 18.6%, and 18.8%, respectively. Modified titration met the 24-week primary outcome with 94% probability of achieving ≥ 20% RRR versus the standard arm. Modified titration also had significantly lower ARIA-E severity, but similar cumulative exposure and mean amyloid reduction compared to the standard arm.
DISCUSSION: Gradual up-titration of dose significantly reduced ARIA-E risk while demonstrating comparable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics compared to standard dosing.
HIGHLIGHTS: In TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, the amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) frequency was 13.7% in the modified titration arm compared to 23.7% in the standard arm at week 24. The modified titration arm met the primary endpoint of ARIA-E relative risk reduction at 24 weeks versus the standard arm. The modified titration versus standard arm at week 24 had comparable non-ARIA-E related safety profile, amyloid reduction, plasma phosphorylated tau217 reduction, cumulative exposure, and pharmacokinetics. Data at week 52 were consistent with week 24 results.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39737785,"Spatial proteomic differences in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease, and primary age-related tauopathy hippocampi.","INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) all feature hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau)-immunoreactive neurofibrillary degeneration, but differ in neuroanatomical distribution and progression of neurofibrillary degeneration and amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition.
METHODS: We used Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling to compare the expression of 70 proteins in neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing and non-NFT-bearing neurons in hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA4 subregions and entorhinal cortex of cases with autopsy-confirmed AD (n = 8), PART (n = 7), and CTE (n = 5).
RESULTS: There were numerous subregion-specific differences related to Aβ processing, autophagy/proteostasis, inflammation, gliosis, oxidative stress, neuronal/synaptic integrity, and p-tau epitopes among these different disorders.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that there are subregion-specific proteomic differences among the neurons of these disorders, which appear to be influenced to a large degree by the presence of hippocampal Aβ. These proteomic differences may play a role in the differing hippocampal p-tau distribution and pathogenesis of these disorders.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), possible primary age-related tauopathy (PART), definite PART, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can be differentiated based on the proteomic composition of their neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)- and non-NFT-bearing neurons. The proteome of these NFT- and non-NFT-bearing neurons is largely correlated with the presence or absence of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons in CTE and definite PART (Aβ-independent pathologies) share numerous proteomic similarities that distinguish them from ADNC and possible PART (Aβ-positive pathologies).",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39954128,Brain tissue metal concentrations and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in total joint arthroplasty patients versus controls.,"We examined whether total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is associated with increased metal accumulation in the brain and histopathologic changes of Alzheimer's disease. We measured ultra-trace metal concentrations (aluminum, chromium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, and vanadium) on postmortem frozen tissues of the occipital lobe of 177 subjects (89 non-TJA and 88 TJA) using a triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and correlated elemental concentrations to the degree of Alzheimer's disease neuropathic change (ADNC). To effectively assess the relationship between TJA and brain metal concentrations, subjects with and without TJA were matched for baseline clinical characteristics and showed no difference in postmortem Alzheimer's disease neuropathic change. TJA subjects had increased concentrations of cobalt and titanium and both metals were associated with increased amyloid plaques. In both the TJA and non-TJA subjects, increased concentrations of cobalt, titanium, manganese, and molybdenum were associated with increased odds of neuritic and diffuse plaques. Lastly, the brain's inter-metal correlations were altered in the presence of increased neuritic plaques and/or implantable artificial joints. These findings suggest that metal concentrations and homeostasis vary in presence of TJA.",Acta Neuropathol,2025
39868827,Natural language processing-based classification of early Alzheimer's disease from connected speech.,"INTRODUCTION: The automated analysis of connected speech using natural language processing (NLP) emerges as a possible biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear which types of connected speech are most sensitive and specific for the detection of AD.
METHODS: We applied a language model to automatically transcribed connected speech from 114 Flemish-speaking individuals to first distinguish early AD patients from amyloid negative cognitively unimpaired (CU) and then amyloid negative from amyloid positive CU individuals using five different types of connected speech.
RESULTS: The language model was able to distinguish between amyloid negative CU subjects and AD patients with up to 81.9% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity. Discrimination between amyloid positive and negative CU individuals was less accurate, with up to 82.7% sensitivity and 74.0% specificity. Moreover, autobiographical interviews consistently outperformed scene descriptions.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the value of autobiographical interviews for the automated analysis of connecting speech.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study compared five types of connected speech for the detection of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autobiographical interviews yielded a higher specificity than scene descriptions. A preceding clinical AD classification task can refine the performance of amyloid status classification in cognitively healthy individuals.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39774493,Sex differences in mitochondrial free-carnitine levels in subjects at-risk and with Alzheimer's disease in two independent study cohorts.,"A major challenge in the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the identification of molecular mechanisms linked to specific pathophysiological features of the disease. Importantly AD has a two-fold higher incidence in women than men and a protracted prodromal phase characterized by amnestic mild-cognitive impairment (aMCI) suggesting that biological processes occurring early can initiate vulnerability to AD. Here, we used a sample of 125 subjects from two independent study cohorts to determine the levels in plasma (the most accessible specimen) of two essential mitochondrial markers acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) and its derivative free-carnitine motivated by a mechanistic model in rodents in which targeting mitochondrial metabolism of LAC leads to the amelioration of cognitive function and boosts epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression. We report a sex-specific deficiency in free-carnitine levels in women with aMCI and early-AD compared to cognitively healthy controls; no change was observed in men. We also replicated the prior finding of decreased LAC levels in both women and men with AD, supporting the robustness of the study samples assayed in our new study. The magnitude of the sex-specific free-carnitine deficiency reflected the severity of cognitive dysfunction and held in two study cohorts. Furthermore, patients with the lower free-carnitine levels showed higher β-amyloid(Aβ) accumulation and t-Tau levels assayed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Computational analyses showed that the mitochondrial markers assayed in plasma are at least as accurate as CSF measures to classify disease status. Together with the mechanistic platform in rodents, these translational findings lay the groundwork to create preventive individualized treatments targeting sex-specific changes in mitochondrial metabolism that may be subtle to early cognitive dysfunction of AD risk.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40181791,Genetic and Lifestyle Risks for Coronary Artery Disease and Long-Term Risk of Incident Dementia Subtypes.,"BACKGROUND: Shared genetic and lifestyle risk factors may underlie the development of both coronary artery disease (CAD) and dementia. We examined whether an increased genetic risk for CAD is associated with long-term risk of developing all-cause, Alzheimer's, or vascular dementia, and investigated whether differences in potentially modifiable lifestyle factors in the mid- to late-life period may attenuate this risk.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 365 782 participants free from dementia for at least 5 years after baseline assessment was conducted within the UK Biobank cohort. Genetic risk was assessed using a genomewide polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD and lifestyle risk using a modified version of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 Lifestyle Risk Score (LRS). Higher values for both scores were deemed to represent increased risk. Primary outcomes were incident all-cause, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia diagnoses obtained from electronic health records. Secondary outcomes were neuroimaging phenotypes measured in 32 028 participants recalled for magnetic resonance imaging. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the extent by which biological and behavioral risk factors contributed to observed associations.
RESULTS: A total of 8870 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over a median 13.9-year follow-up. Both genetic (PRS) and lifestyle (LRS) risk scores for CAD were associated with a modestly elevated risk of all-cause dementia (subhazard ratio per SD increase, 1.10 [1.08, 1.12], P&lt;0.001, for PRS and 1.04 [1.02, 1.06], P=0.006, for LRS). This risk appeared largely attributable to underlying vascular dementia diagnoses (subhazard ratio, 1.16 [1.11, 1.21], P&lt;0.001 for PRS and 1.15 [1.09, 1.22], P&lt;0.001, for LRS), because Alzheimer's disease was found to demonstrate moderate associations with PRS alone (subhazard ratio, 1.09 [1.06, 1.13]; P&lt;0.001). LRS was found to have an additive rather than interactive effect with PRS, with individuals in the highest tertiles for both genetic and lifestyle risk for CAD ≈70% more likely to develop vascular dementia during follow-up compared with those in the lowest tertiles for both (subhazard ratio, 1.71 [1.39, 2.11]; P&lt;0.001). This was substantially attenuated in those with a low LRS at baseline, however, regardless of underlying genetic risk (40% to 50% reduction for low versus high LRS tertile regardless of PRS tertile; P&lt;0.001 for all). In a subset of individuals recalled for neuroimaging assessments, those in the highest tertiles for genetic and lifestyle risk for CAD demonstrated a ≈25% greater volume of white matter hyperintensities than those in the lowest risk tertiles, but showed little difference in gray matter or hippocampal volumes. Sensitivity analyses identified associations between both biological and behavioral risk scores with white matter hyperintensity burden and vascular dementia, whereas some Alzheimer's dementia associations showed seemingly paradoxical relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are genetically predisposed to developing CAD also face an increased risk of developing dementia in old age. This risk is reduced in those demonstrating healthy lifestyle profiles earlier in the lifespan, particularly in those who may be at an increased risk of developing dementia caused by an underlying vascular pathology.",Circulation,2025
40143849,The role of intracellular and extracellular copper compartmentalization in Alzheimer's disease pathology and its implications for diagnosis and therapy.,"Copper is a trace element indispensable for cellular physiology, integral to cellular redox balance, and a constituent of enzyme active sites, thereby playing a pivotal role in cellular physiological function. Concerning the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the homeostatic balance of copper is perturbed both intracellularly and extracellularly. The copper-amyloid precursor protein (APP) complex facilitates the efflux of copper from cells, leading to intracellular copper depletion. Concurrently, extracellular copper associates with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, precipitating copper-enriched Aβ deposition and augmenting reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain tissue, which finally culminates in oxidative brain damage. The interaction between copper and APP enhances the α-secretase pathway of APP processing while suppressing the β-secretase pathway, resulting in an increased production of soluble APP (sAPP), which contributes to neuroinflammation in the brain tissue. Utilizing the affinity of copper for Aβ plaques, the application of chelating agents to sequester copper within the brain can mitigate neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology. Furthermore, the use of metal imaging techniques to detect copper in the brain offers a potential diagnostic tool for the early identification of AD.",Front Neurosci,2025
39908361,Reducing microglial lipid load enhances β amyloid phagocytosis in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Macrophages accumulate lipid droplets (LDs) under stress and inflammatory conditions. Despite the presence of LD-loaded macrophages in many tissues, including the brain, their contribution to neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by assessing the contribution of LD-loaded brain macrophages, including microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), in an AD mouse model. Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/Fit2<sup>i</sup><sup>Δ</sup><sup>M</sup><sup>φ</sup> transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.",Sci Adv,2025
40095881,Efficacy of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Photobiomodulation in Improving Cognitive Abilities for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Due to the increasing global prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and photobiomodulation (PBM) are considered potential complementary therapies. Objective: We assessed the efficacy and safety of tDCS and PBM and their potential to enhance cognitive functions in individuals with AD. Methods: This review primarily examined studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, followed by an assessment of the safety of tDCS and PBM for people with AD. The databases searched were PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection, resulting in 17 published randomized and controlled trials. References were screened over 5 years (2020-2024). The research design used PRISMA guidelines. Results: Fourteen studies were considered for tDCS, and the current literature supports efficacy and safety at an amperage of 2 mA, with electrodes placed on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Three studies were included for PBM. The heterogeneity of these study measures made them unsuitable for combined efficacy analysis, and they did not provide a safety evaluation. Conclusions: Despite differences in efficacy assessments, tDCS and PBM improved cognitive abilities. There is an urgent need to standardize metrics for evaluating efficacy and safety, particularly for PBM. Future research is encouraged.",J Clin Med,2025
39836667,Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy in Alzheimer Disease: A Comparison Between Different Versions of the Boston Criteria.,"OBJECTIVES: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the main driver of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) in Alzheimer disease (AD). We compared different versions of the Boston criteria for CAA diagnosis in AD.
METHODS: This article presents a single-center analysis (outpatient neurodegenerative clinic) of patients with AD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early dementia, meeting NIA-AA criteria and having biological amyloid confirmation (CSF or imaging). Two raters analyzed hemorrhagic (cerebral microbleeds, CMBs; cortical superficial siderosis, cSS) and nonhemorrhagic (severe centrum semiovale perivascular spaces, CSO-PVSs; multispot pattern white matter hyperintensities (WMHs)) markers following the original (V1.0), modified (V1.5), and latest (V2.0) Boston criteria.
RESULTS: We included 75 patients (mean age 71.6 ± 8.1 years, 53% female, mean disease duration 2.6 ± 2.0 years, 91% MCI). White matter CAA markers were more common than hemorrhagic markers: 41 (55%) had severe CSO-PVSs, 28 (37%) had multispot WHMs, 12 (16%) had 1 lobar CMB, 9 had ≥2 lobar CMBs (12%), 1 (1.3%) had focal cSS, and 5 (6.7) had disseminated cSS. The prevalence of possible and probable CAA was lowest with V1.0 (14.7% and 9.3%) than with V1.5 (13.3% and 13.3%) and V2.0 (42.7% and 26.7%) criteria.
DISCUSSION: More than 1 in 4 patients with AD had probable CAA according to the V2.0 Boston criteria. These findings might inform future trials.",Neurology,2025
39806423,Upregulated astrocyte HDAC7 induces Alzheimer-like tau pathologies via deacetylating transcription factor-EB and inhibiting lysosome biogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, will convert into the reactive state in response to proteotoxic stress such as tau accumulation, a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The formation of reactive astrocytes is partially attributed to the disruption of autophagy lysosomal signaling, and inhibiting of some histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been demonstrated to reduce the molecular and functional characteristics of reactive astrocytes. However, the precise role of autophagy lysosomal signaling in astrocytes that regulates tau pathology remains unclear.
METHODS: We investigated the expression of class IIa HDAC7 in astrocytes from AD patients and PS19 mice. PS19 mice were treated with AAVs expressing shRNA for HDAC7 with astrocyte-specific promoter and with a selective class IIa HDAC inhibitor, TMP195, and the effects on tau pathology, gliosis, synaptic plasticity and cognition-related behavioral performance were measured. Tau uptake and degradation assays in cultured astrocytes were utilized to investigate the role of HDAC7 on astrocyte-mediated tau clearance. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, western blotting, RT-qPCR, mass spectrometric, and luciferase reporter assay were used to identify HDAC7 substrates, modification site and related signaling pathways in astrocyte-tau clearance. We generated a new antibody to clarify the role of HDAC7-mediated signaling in AD patients and PS19 mice.
RESULTS: Here, we found that the level of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) was remarkably increased in the astrocytes of AD patients and P301S tau transgenic (PS19) mice. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC7 effectively enhanced astrocytic clearance of tau with improved cognitive functions in PS19 mice. HDAC7 could modulate astrocytic uptake and lysosomal degradation of tau proteins through a transcriptional factor EB (TFEB) acetylation-dependent manner. Specifically, deacetylation of TFEB at K310 site by HDAC7 prevented TFEB nuclear translocation with reduced lysosomal biogenesis and tau clearance in astrocytes, whereas inhibiting HDAC7 restored astrocytic TFEB acetylation level at K310 with improved tau pathology and cognitive functions in PS19 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that upregulation of HDAC7 induces AD-like tau pathologies via deacetylating TFEB and inhibiting lysosomal biogenesis in astrocytes, and downregulating HDAC7-TFEB signaling is promising for arresting AD and other tauopathies.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39969998,Druggable genome screens identify SPP as an antiviral host target for multiple flaviviruses.,"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, pose significant public health threats globally. Extensive efforts have led to the development of promising highly active compounds against DENV targeting viral non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) protein. However, due to the cocirculation of flaviviruses and to prepare for emerging flaviviruses, there is a need for more broadly acting antivirals. Host-directed therapy where one targets a host factor required for viral replication may be active against multiple viruses that use similar replication strategies. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 library that we designed to target the druggable genome and identified signal peptide peptidase (SPP, encoded by Histocompatibility Minor 13, HM13), as a critical host factor in DENV infection. Genetic knockout or introducing mutations that disrupt the proteolytic activity of SPP markedly reduced the replication of multiple flaviviruses. Although their substrates differ, SPP has structural homology with γ-secretase, which has been pursued as a pharmacological target for Alzheimer's disease. Notably, SPP-targeting compounds exhibited potent anti-DENV activity at low nanomolar concentrations across multiple primary and disease-relevant cell types, acting specifically through SPP inhibition rather than γ-secretase inhibition. Importantly, SPP inhibitors were active at low nanomolar concentrations against flaviviruses other than DENV including ZIKV while DENV NS4B inhibitors lost activity. This study emphasizes the strong potential of SPP as a pan-flaviviral target and provides a framework for identifying host druggable targets to screen for broad-spectrum antivirals.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025
40105503,Cerebrospinal fluid LMO4 as a synaptic biomarker linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline.,"BackgroundLIM-domain-only 4 (LMO4) is involved in neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity, but its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) LMO4 levels and core AD biomarkers, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline.MethodsWe included 703 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Associations between CSF LMO4 and AD biomarkers (Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Ptau181, amyloid PET) and postmortem neuropathology were evaluated. We also explored cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between CSF LMO4 and neurodegeneration and cognitive function. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CSF LMO4 in distinguishing Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative participants and amyloid PET-confirmed AD cases. Mediation analysis explored the potential mediating role of CSF LMO4 between Aβ pathology and tau pathology.ResultsLMO4 levels were decreased in participants with abnormal Aβ levels and cognitive impairment. Lower CSF LMO4 levels were associated with increased Aβ and tau pathology, brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and postmortem neuropathology. CSF LMO4 partially mediated the relationship between Aβ and tau pathology and demonstrated acceptable discriminative ability in distinguishing Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative participants and amyloid PET-confirmed AD from non-AD cases.ConclusionsCSF LMO4 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD and may represent a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39890920,Dopaminergic deficits along the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease.,"Both post-mortem and in vivo data argue for dopamine dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the timing and regional progression of dopaminergic systems alterations in AD are still debated. The aim of the study was to investigate in vivo the pattern of dopaminergic changes and connectivity using DAT-SPECT imaging in patients across the AD spectrum. Fifty-nine AD patients (n = 21 AD-MCI; n = 38 AD-DEM) and a control group (CG) of n = 45 age- and sex-matched individuals entered the study and underwent <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT dopaminergic imaging. The occipital binding was used as reference region to obtain single-subject binding in different brain regions. Between-group differences in <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT binding in both mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways were assessed using an ANCOVA test, adjusting for the effect of center of imaging acquisition, age, and sex. Regions resulting from the voxel-wise direct comparison between AD-MCI and AD-DEM were considered as a seed of interest for a voxel-wise interregional correlation analysis. Both AD-MCI and AD-DEM patients showed dopaminergic depletion within the basal ganglia, whereas cortico-limbic regions (namely hippocampus, amygdala, anterior and middle cingulate, frontal cortex and thalamus) resulted impaired only in the dementia phase. The brain voxel-wise interregional correlation analysis showed a progressive pattern of disruption of caudate/thalamus dopaminergic connectivity to hippocampus and amygdala from AD-MCI to AD-DEM stages. This study indicates basal ganglia dopaminergic alterations and connectivity disruption in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems already in early stage AD, extending to several cortico-limbic regions in dementia phases.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40170213,Unraveling the genetic underpinnings of mitochondrial traits and associated circulating inflammatory proteins in Alzheimer's disease: Mitochondrial HtrA2-T cell CD5 negative axis.,"BackgroundPrevious studies with limited sample sizes have indicated a link between mitochondrial traits, inflammatory proteins, and Alzheimer's disease. The exact causality and their mediation relationships remain unclear.ObjectiveOur study aimed to delve into the genetic underpinnings of mitochondrial function and circulating inflammatory proteins in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.MethodsWe leveraged aggregated data from the largest genome-wide association study, including 69 mitochondrial traits, 91 circulating inflammatory proteins, and Alzheimer's disease. Bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate their primary causal relationships. Thereafter a two-step MR mediation analysis was utilized to clarify the modulating effects of inflammatory proteins on mitochondria and Alzheimer's disease.ResultsOur study identified mitochondrial phenylalanine-tRNA ligase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, and serine protease HtrA2 and carbonic anhydrase 5A as protective factors against Alzheimer's disease. Four inflammatory proteins (T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5, C-X-C motif chemokine 11, TGF-α, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) played protective roles against Alzheimer's disease. Axin-1 and IL-6 increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5 was found to be a significant mediator between mitochondrial serine protease HTRA2 and Alzheimer's disease with the two-step MR method, accounting for 10.83% of the total effect.ConclusionsOur study emphasized mitochondrial HtrA2-T cell CD5 as a negative axis in Alzheimer's disease, offering novel perspectives on its etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40103927,Comparing machine learning classifier models in discriminating cognitively unimpaired older adults from three clinical cohorts in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum: demonstration analyses in the COMPASS-ND study.,"BACKGROUND: Research in aging, impairment, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) often requires powerful computational models for discriminating between clinical cohorts and identifying early biomarkers and key risk or protective factors. Machine Learning (ML) approaches represent a diverse set of data-driven tools for performing such tasks in big or complex datasets. We present systematic demonstration analyses to compare seven frequently used ML classifier models and two eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques on multiple performance metrics for a common neurodegenerative disease dataset. The aim is to identify and characterize the best performing ML and XAI algorithms for the present data.
METHOD: We accessed a Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging dataset featuring four well-characterized cohorts: Cognitively Unimpaired (CU), Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD (N = 255). All participants contributed 102 multi-modal biomarkers and risk factors. Seven ML algorithms were compared along six performance metrics in discriminating between cohorts. Two XAI algorithms were compared using five performance and five similarity metrics.
RESULTS: Although all ML models performed relatively well in the extreme-cohort comparison (CU/AD), the Super Learner (SL), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient-Boosted trees (GB) algorithms excelled in the challenging near-cohort comparisons (CU/SCI). For the XAI interpretation comparison, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) generally outperformed Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanation (LIME) in key performance properties.
CONCLUSION: The ML results indicate that two tree-based methods (RF and GB) are reliable and effective as initial models for classification tasks involving discrete clinical aging and neurodegeneration data. In the XAI phase, SHAP performed better than LIME due to lower computational time (when applied to RF and GB) and incorporation of feature interactions, leading to more reliable results.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39696904,Evidence of cortical vascular impairments in early stage of Alzheimer's transgenic mice: Optical imaging.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive cognitive decline, remains clinically challenging with limited understanding of etiology and interventions. Clinical studies have reported vascular defects prior to other pathological manifestations of AD, leading to the ""Vascular Hypothesis"" for the disorder. However, in vivo assessments of cerebral vasculature in AD rodent models have been constrained by limited spatiotemporal resolution or field of view of conventional imaging. We herein employed two in vivo imaging technologies, Dual-Wavelength Imaging and Optical Coherence Doppler Tomography, to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to vasoconstrictive cocaine and vasodilatory hypercapnia challenges and to detect resting 3D cerebral blood flow (CBF) in living transgenic AD mice at capillary resolution. Results showed that CVR to cocaine and hypercapnia was significantly attenuated in 7-10 months old AD mice vs controls, indicating reduced vascular flexibility and reactivity. Additionally, in the AD mice, arterial CBF velocities were slower and the microvascular density in cortex was decreased compared to controls. These results reveal significant vascular impairments including reduced CVR and resting CBF in early-staged AD mice. Hence, this cutting-edge in vivo optical imaging offers an innovative venue for detecting early neurovascular dysfunction in AD brain with translational potential.",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,2024
40111762,Novel modelling approaches to elucidate the genetic architecture of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Up to 30% of older adults meet pathological criteria for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at autopsy yet never show signs of cognitive impairment. Recent work has highlighted genetic drivers of this resilience, or better-than-expected cognitive performance given a level of neuropathology, that allow the aged brain to protect itself from the downstream consequences of amyloid and tau deposition. However, models of resilience have been constrained by reliance on measures of neuropathology, substantially limiting the number of participants available for analysis. We sought to determine if novel approaches using APOE allele status, age, and other demographic variables as a proxy for neuropathology could still effectively quantify resilience and uncover novel genetic drivers associated with better-than-expected cognitive performance while vastly expanding sample size and statistical power. Leveraging 20,513 participants from eight well-characterized cohort studies of aging, we determined the effects of genetic variants on resilience metrics using mixed-effects regressions. The outcome of interest was residual cognitive resilience, quantified from residuals in three cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and language) and built within two frameworks: ""silver"" models, which obviate the requirement for neuropathological data (n=17,241), and ""gold"" models, which include post-mortem neuropathological assessments (n=3,272). We then performed cross-ancestry genome wide association studies (European ancestry n=18,269, African ancestry n=2,244), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses. All analyses were conducted across all participants and repeated when restricted to those with unimpaired cognition at baseline. Despite different modeling approaches, the silver and gold phenotypes were highly correlated (R=0.77-0.88) and displayed comparable performance in quantifying better-than or worse-than-expected cognition, enabling silver-gold meta-analyses. Genetic correlation analyses highlighted associations of resilience with multiple neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular traits (PFDR values < 5.0x10-2). In pathway-level tests, we observed three significant associations with resilience: metabolism of amino acids and derivatives (PFDR=4.1x10-2), negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta production (PFDR=1.9x10-2), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (PFDR=3.9x10-4). Finally, in single-variant analyses, we identified a locus on chromosome 17 approaching genome-wide significance among cognitively unimpaired participants (index single nucleotide polymorphism: rs757022, minor allele frequency = 0.18, β=0.08, P=1.1x10-7). The top variant at this locus (rs757022) was significantly associated with expression of numerous ATP-binding cassette genes in brain. Overall, through validating a novel modeling approach, we demonstrate the utility of silver models of resilience to increase statistical power and participant diversity.",Brain,2025
39730760,Multi-omics analysis reveals the genetic aging landscape of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Despite numerous studies, specific age-related factors remain unidentified. This study employed a multi-omics approach to investigate the link between PD and aging. We integrated blood gene expression profiles, expression quantitative trait loci, genome-wide association studies, predictive models, and conducted clinical validation.By analyzing PD datasets, a total of 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 10 intersecting aging differentially expressed genes (ADEGs) were identified. Enrichment analysis revealed that the regulatory pathways of these ADEGs involve the classical Wnt signaling pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuronal apoptosis. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis showed that the MAP3K5 gene significantly reduces the risk of PD. Multivariate regression analysis identified MXD1, CREB1, and SIRT3 as key diagnostic genes and constructed a predictive model to aid clinical decision-making. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments validated the expression levels of these genes in the serum of PD patients.This study utilized a multi-omics approach to identify key ADEGs and their regulatory mechanisms in PD, leading to the establishment of a diagnostic model. The resource is accessible at this link: https://yunhaihupo.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp . This web application can be used as a standalone resource to explore changes in blood transcription profiles in PD and their relationship to clinical and aging aspects, generating new research hypotheses.",Sci Rep,2024
40046332,Enlarged cavum septum pellucidum as a neuroimaging signature of head impact exposure.,"Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is commonly observed upon neuroimaging examination in individuals exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and post-mortem in cases with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Consequently, CSP has been proposed as a potential biomarker for RHI-related neurodegeneration, yet prevalence estimates of CSP across other neurodegenerative diseases and its clinical implications are largely unknown. We assessed CSP prevalence and clinical correlates in individuals with RHI exposure, a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neurodegenerative disease (i.e. Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia) and normal cognition. The primary group of interest, i.e. individuals exposed to RHI in contact sports or military service (n = 65; mean exposure 21.58 years), was compared against age- and sex-matched participants with TBI (n = 57; number of TBI range: 1-5) and non-exposed participants of the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (Alzheimer's disease, n = 30; frontotemporal dementia, n = 24; normal cognition, n = 27). Structural 3D brain MRI scans were visually rated for CSP grade (ranging 0-4) by two raters blinded to the clinical information. A CSP of at least Grade 2 was considered enlarged/abnormal. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohens' weighted Kappa (κ). We investigated whether prevalence of enlarged CSP differed between groups and assessed associations with neuropsychological outcomes (verbal memory, processing speed, mental flexibility and semantic fluency), neuropsychiatric symptoms (neuropsychiatric inventory), ventricular enlargement as measured with Evan's index and MRI volumes of composite regions (limbic, temporal-meta regions and the whole brain). Inter-rater reliability was substantial [κ = 0.734 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.80)]. An enlarged CSP was more often observed in the RHI group (44.6%) compared with individuals with Alzheimer's disease [13.3%, odds ratio (OR) = 5.24 (1.79-19.26)], frontotemporal dementia [16.7%, OR = 4.03 (1.35-15.02)] and normal cognition [18.5%, OR = 3.54 (1.27-11.62)], all P <sub>FDR</sub> &lt; 0.05, but not compared with the TBI group [29.8%, OR = 1.90 (0.90-4.06), P <sub>FDR</sub>  = 0.094]. In those with RHI, enlarged CSP was associated with lower outcomes on verbal memory learning (η² = 0.09, P <sub>FDR</sub> = 0.023) and recall (η² = 0.08, P <sub>FDR</sub> = 0.030). For TBI, enlarged CSP was associated with lower performance on verbal memory learning; however, this lost significance after multiple comparison correction (η² = 0.014, P <sub>FDR</sub> = 0.09). Enlarged CSP was not associated with the composite MRI volumes, ventricular enlargement or neuropsychiatric symptoms. In summary, enlarged CSP was more prevalent in RHI-exposed individuals compared with individuals with a neurodegenerative disease or normal cognition, but not compared with TBI, and was associated with lower verbal memory performance in the RHI group. Our study highlights enlarged CSP as a potential consequence of long-term head impact exposure and, to a lesser extent, TBI, rather than a general consequence of neurodegeneration.",Brain Commun,2025
40027465,Application of artificial intelligence in Alzheimer's disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how artificial intelligence (AI) is employed to predict, diagnose, and perform relevant analyses in Alzheimer's disease research is a rapidly evolving field. This study integrated and analyzed the relevant literature from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) on the application of AI in Alzheimer's disease (AD), covering publications from 2004 to 2023.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the key research hotspots and trends of the application of AI in AD over the past 20 years through a bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: Using the Web of Science Core Collection database, we conducted a comprehensive visual analysis of literature on AI and AD published between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2023. The study utilized Excel, Scimago Graphica, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace software to visualize trends in annual publications and the distribution of research by countries, institutions, journals, references, authors, and keywords related to this topic.
RESULTS: A total of 2,316 papers were obtained through the research process, with a significant increase in publications observed since 2018, signaling notable growth in this field. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom made notable contributions to this research area. The University of London led in institutional productivity with 80 publications, followed by the University of California System with 74 publications. Regarding total publications, the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease was the most prolific while Neuroimage ranked as the most cited journal. Shen Dinggang was the top author in both total publications and average citations. Analysis of reference and keyword highlighted research hotspots, including the identification of various stages of AD, early diagnostic screening, risk prediction, and prediction of disease progression. The ""task analysis"" keyword emerged as a research frontier from 2021 to 2023.
CONCLUSION: Research on AI applications in AD holds significant potential for practical advancements, attracting increasing attention from scholars. Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as a key research focus for AD diagnosis. Future research will explore AI methods, particularly task analysis, emphasizing integrating multimodal data and utilizing deep neural networks. These approaches aim to identify emerging risk factors, such as environmental influences on AD onset, predict disease progression with high accuracy, and support the development of prevention strategies. Ultimately, AI-driven innovations will transform AD management from a progressive, incurable state to a more manageable and potentially reversible condition, thereby improving healthcare, rehabilitation, and long-term care solutions.",Front Neurosci,2025
40036035,Hospice Use Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Parkinson Disease and Dementia With Lewy Bodies.,"IMPORTANCE: Neurodegenerative disorders are now the most common reason that Medicare beneficiaries enroll in hospice for end-of-life care. People with all-cause dementia have high rates of suboptimal hospice use, but little is known about hospice use patterns in Lewy body disease, which includes both Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
OBJECTIVE: To compare patient characteristics, hospice agency characteristics, and patterns of use for beneficiaries with PD and DLB vs Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study including a 100% sample of national 2010-2020 calendar year Medicare data on hospice enrollees was performed. Data analysis was conducted from November 2023 to May 2024.
EXPOSURES: A diagnosis of PD or DLB, compared with AD as the reference group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of enrollees with short stays (<7 days), proportion with long stays (>180 days), proportion disenrolled for any reason before death, and disenrollment by type.
RESULTS: Of 11 327 324 Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in hospice between 2010 and 2020 who met eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age, 85.2 [7.5] years; 781 763 [63.0%] female), there were 958 182 (8.4%) with a primary diagnosis of AD, 232 864 (2.1%) with PD, and 49 340 (0.4%) with DLB. People with PD were more likely to experience a long stay (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16) compared with AD, whereas the odds for those with DLB were not increased. However, people with either PD or DLB were less likely to be disenrolled for extended prognosis compared with AD (OR for DLB, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85; OR for PD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88). People with PD were more likely to revoke hospice (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27-1.32) compared with AD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries, hospice use patterns differed by dementia subtype. Higher likelihood of hospice revocation in PD raises important questions about unmet needs and highlights the need for more research around the experience of the end of life in this growing population.",JAMA Netw Open,2025
40144618,Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease using artificial intelligence and cortical features on T1WI sequences.,"BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging task, which is crucial for helping develop personalized treatment plans to improve prognosis.
PURPOSE: To develop new technology for the early prediction of AD using artificial intelligence and cortical features on MRI.
METHODS: A total of 162 MCI patients were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. By using a 3D-MPRAGE sequence, T1W images for each patient were acquired. All patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 112) and a validation set (n = 50) at a ratio of 7:3. Morphological features of the cerebral cortex were extracted with FreeSurfer software. Network features were extracted from gray matter with the GRETNA toolbox. The network, morphology, network-clinical, morphology-clinical, morphology-network and morphology-network-clinical models were developed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. The performance of each model was assessed by the concordance index (C-index).
RESULTS: In the training group, the C-indexes of the network, morphology, network-clinical, morphology-clinical, morphology-network and morphology-network-clinical models were 0.834, 0.926, 0.915, 0.949, 0.928, and 0.951, respectively. The C-indexes of those models in the validation group were 0.765, 0.784, 0.849, 0.877, 0.884, and 0.880, respectively. The morphology-network-clinical model performed the best. A multi-predictor nomogram with high accuracy for individual AD prediction (C-index = 0.951) was established.
CONCLUSION: The early occurrence of AD could be accurately predicted using our morphology-network-clinical model and the multi-predictor nomogram. This could help doctors make early and personalized treatment decisions in clinical practice, which showed important clinical significance.",Front Neurol,2025
39994990,Institutionalization of persons with Alzheimer's disease in the Czech and Slovak Republics.,"BackgroundThe prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing, and with it comes the demand for specialized services. Current information on the institutionalization of patients with AD is limited.ObjectiveTo determine the level of institutionalization among AD patients in the facilities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.MethodsA survey of the rate of institutionalization in facilities in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. The survey collects data on the institutionalization of patients suffering from AD in relation to the capacity of the facilities and the prevalence of the disease. Data were collected by representative quantitative survey, during years 2019-2021.ResultsPatients with AD occupy approximately 25% of the total capacities of institutions in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The rate of institutionalization of patients with AD is estimated at 20.5% in the Czech Republic and 24% in the Slovak Republic. This is more than the estimated worldwide rate of institutionalization of people with AD (16%) but less than the estimated rate of institutionalization of these patients in high-income countries (31%).ConclusionsAs the prevalence of AD increases, so do the demands for care. If there is no increase in institutional capacity, this growth will put more pressure on home care. In order to provide specialized care to as many patients as possible, emphasis must be placed on increasing the capacity of institutions.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40043469,CSF α-synuclein aggregation is associated with APOE ε4 and progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"At autopsy, around half of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibit Lewy body pathology, and the main component of Lewy body pathology is α-synuclein aggregates. This study investigated the prevalence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein aggregation and its association with demographic factors and cognitive decline among 1619 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with the test for α-synuclein aggregation by seed amplification assay (SAA). This cohort consisted of 595 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 765 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 259 with AD dementia. The results showed a higher prevalence of positive α-synuclein aggregation status in the AD dementia group (37.07 %) and the MCI group (22.75 %) compared to CN controls (16.13 %). Additionally, APOE ε4 carriers exhibited a higher prevalence of α-synuclein aggregation compared to non-carriers: 20.12 % for APOE ε4-/- (non-carriers), 24.82 % for APOE ε4 + /-, and 30.92 % for APOE ε4 + /+ . Longitudinally, positive CSF α-synuclein aggregation associated with accelerated cognitive decline, especially in the MCI and AD groups. Notably, positive aggregation status did not significantly affect cognitive trajectories in CN individuals. Moreover, APOE ε4 carriers with positive CSF α-synuclein aggregation experienced more pronounced cognitive decline. This study provides evidence that CSF α-synuclein aggregation is associated with cognitive function and the APOE ε4 allele. These findings suggest that CSF α-synuclein SAA, in combination with APOE ε4 status, could serve as biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline in AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
39988989,Disclosure of elevated amyloid status is not associated with long-term suicidality in a preclinical AD trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The long-term implications of disclosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired individuals are unknown.
METHODS: We compared participants who disclosed their elevated amyloid imaging result in a preclinical AD trial to those who disclosed a not elevated result and enrolled in an observational cohort that underwent parallel assessments. Our primary outcome was a score > 0 on the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at any visit; we also considered suicidal behaviors (CSSRS > 5).
RESULTS: Among 1707 total participants (68% elevated amyloid, mean [standard deviation] age 71.5 [4.7], 60% female, 90% non-Hispanic White), followed for a mean 218 (74.1) weeks, there were no suicides and few indications of suicidal thoughts (n = 124 [7%]) or behaviors (n = 13 [<1%]). In a generalized estimating equation model controlling for covariates, we observed no effect of amyloid status on the primary outcome of CSSRS > 0 (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 0.76, 3.37).
DISCUSSION: With a structured approach, brain amyloid results can be returned safely.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study was among the first and largest studies to include biomarker disclosure in a population without cognitive impairment. Routine psychological assessment provided a novel assessment of the impact of disclosure in this sample. Learning an elevated brain amyloid result through a protocolized approach was not associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors compared to a matched cohort who learned they did not have elevated brain amyloid. Future research will be needed to ensure similar safety in more real-world settings.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39936291,The Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST): A plasma proteomic predictor of 20-year dementia risk.,"INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need for tools to quantify dementia risk during its multi-decade preclinical/prodromal phase, given that current biomarkers predict risk over shorter follow-up periods and are specific to Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Using high-throughput proteomic assays and machine learning techniques in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (n = 11,277), we developed the Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST).
RESULTS: In addition to outperforming existing plasma biomarkers, the dSST predicted mid-life dementia risk over a 20-year follow-up across two independent cohorts with different ethnic backgrounds (areas under the curve [AUCs]: dSST 0.68-0.70, dSST+age 0.75-0.81). In a separate cohort, the dSST was associated with longitudinal declines across multiple cognitive domains, accelerated brain atrophy, and elevated measures of neuropathology (as evidenced by positron emission tomography and plasma biomarkers).
DISCUSSION: The dSST is a cost-effective, scalable, and minimally invasive protein-based prognostic aid that can quantify risk up to two decades before dementia onset.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Dementia SomaSignal Test (dSST) predicts 20-year dementia risk across two independent cohorts. dSST outperforms existing plasma biomarkers in predicting multi-decade dementia risk. dSST predicts cognitive decline and accelerated brain atrophy in a third cohort. dSST is a prognostic aid that can predict dementia risk over two decades.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39956963,Overlap in the diagnostic criteria of frontotemporal dementia syndromes with parkinsonism.,"BackgroundDifferentiating neurodegenerative diseases can be difficult in the clinical setting. This study examines the overlap of diagnostic criteria between frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes with parkinsonism [e.g., corticobasal syndrome (CBS), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)] and Parkinson's disease (PD).ObjectiveTo explore the diagnostic overlap in patients with FTD syndromes with parkinsonism and PD.MethodsPatient records from 2751 individuals at a tertiary neurological care center were reviewed, resulting in 112 bvFTD, 38 PSP, and 15 CBS patients. Clinical features and diagnostic criteria fulfillment were assessed.ResultsSignificant overlap in diagnostic criteria fulfilment was found: 42 bvFTD and 22 PSP patients met possible CBS criteria, 6 bvFTD patients met possible PSP criteria, and 4 met criteria for all three conditions. Higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of phosphorylated tau and tau were observed in the bvFTD group compared to PSP (p = 0.009, p = 0.002). The Mini-Mental State Examination score also differed between bvFTD and PSP (p = 0.020), and between PSP and CBS (p = 0.047). Neuroimaging showed substantial heterogeneity.ConclusionsThe study reveals significant overlap in diagnostic criteria among FTD syndromes with parkinsonism, underscoring the need for more precise diagnostic criteria. Improved biomarkers could support differential diagnosis and enhance clinical trial design. Common cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers used in Alzheimer's disease diagnostics may provide additional support in the differential diagnosis.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40089221,Longitudinal changes of blood-brain barrier and transcytolemmal water exchange permeability in Alzheimer's disease mice: A non-contrast MRI study.,"Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked with the dysfunction of glymphatic system. Previous studies were primarily cross-sectional and focused on only one specific component, hindering the understanding of overall glymphatic function in AD. We evaluated the longitudinal changes in multiple components of glymphatic system (blood-brain barrier (BBB) and transcytolemmal water exchange (TWE) permeability) in AD mice. Five female wild-type and four 3 × Tg-AD mice from 5 to 13 months of age were scanned monthly using two non-contrast MRI techniques, water-extraction-with-phase-contrast-arterial-spin-tagging (WEPCAST) and diffusion-time-dependent kurtosis imaging (tDKI), yielding BBB and TWE permeability. Immunostaining was used to evaluate tight junction proteins associated with BBB structural integrity, aquaporin 4 (AQP4) related to TWE, and AQP4 perivascular space (PVS) polarization that might represent PVS-parenchyma water exchange. The relationship between glymphatic function and AD pathology, as measured by amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau deposition, was also explored. Our results revealed significantly increased BBB and hippocampal TWE permeability in AD mouse brains, consistent with the histological findings of reduced tight junction proteins and upregulated AQP4, which were correlated with each other and can be predictive of Aβ and tau deposition. Impaired AQP4 PVS polarization was also found in AD mice. In conclusion, water exchange in multiple components of glymphatic system altered in AD mice, and these in vivo MRI findings were validated pathologically, which might affect the waste clearance in the glymphatic neurofluid.",Neuroimage,2025
40116680,A preliminary study on plasma markers across cognitive stages and links to a history of mild traumatic brain injury.,"Potential implications of a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during aging are understudied. Seven plasma markers were measured in matched participants having normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) with and without a history of mTBI. Phosphorylated tau<sub>181</sub> showed a moderate effect size for being greater in mTBI + individuals having MCI and DAT, and effect sizes for lower amyloid-β 42/40 and higher neurofilament light were seen for mTBI + DAT individuals. This preliminary report shows a potential role of plasma-derived markers in detecting associations between mTBI history and the development of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39865680,Sequence of decline on the NIH-toolbox cognitive battery in a predominantly Latino sample with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the sequential progression of cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) in the Latino population is crucial for enhancing early identification for targeted interventions. Given the tablet-based administration and increasing frequency of use in epidemiological research, validating this progression within the NIH Toolbox cognitive battery (NIHTB-CB) is important.
OBJECTIVE: The first aim was to utilize an innovative Event-Based Modeling (EBM) analytic approach to estimate the sequence of cognitive declines in persons at risk for ADAD enriched for being of Latino origin. The second aim was to examine associations between EBM-derived estimates of cognitive disease severity and independent cognitive outcomes within carriers and noncarriers.
METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study (N = 30) included 16 ADAD mutation carriers and 14 noncarriers who completed the NIHTB-CB in their primary language (n = 8 Spanish; n = 22 English). An EBM was constructed to compare ADAD mutation carriers and noncarriers on NIHTB-CB performance. We utilized linear regression to examine the associations between the EBM-derived cognitive-decline disease stage and independent outcomes (e.g., performance on the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and estimated years to dementia diagnosis).
RESULTS: The EBM estimated that tests assessing episodic memory were the first to become abnormal in the sequence of ADAD-related cognitive decline. Each higher estimated cognitive-decline disease stage was associated with approximately a three-point decline in the CASI and two years closer to dementia diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the EBM applied to the tablet-based NIHTB-CB to estimate the likely progression of cognitive decline in Latinos with ADAD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40163129,IL-17 A Exacerbated Neuroinflammatory and Neurodegenerative Biomarkers in Intranasal Amyloid-Beta Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-17 A (IL-17 A) have been found to be significantly associated with AD patients. IL-17 A amplifies neuroinflammation during AD pathology. This study highlighted the ability of IL-17 A to exacerbate amyloid-beta-induced pathology in animals. The AD pathology was induced with repeated intranasal administration of Aβ along with recombinant mouse IL-17 A (rmIL-17) at 1, 2 and 4 µg/kg for seven alternate days. Although, the combination of rmIL-17 and Aβ did not have severe effects on memory of the animals, but it drastically increased the IL-17 A mediated signaling, level of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants in the hippocampus and cortex regions of the animal brains. Interestingly, combining rmIL-17 with Aβ also triggered the expression of AD structural markers like pTau, amyloid-beta and BACE1 in the brain regions. Furthermore, rmIL-17 with Aβ exposure stimulated astrocytes and microglia leading to activation of proinflammatory signaling in the brain of the animals. These results showed the propensity of IL-17 A to promote severity of AD pathology and suggest IL-17 A as potent therapeutic target to control AD progression.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2025
39877089,Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Proteomic Signature in Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD): Role of Adhesion Molecules.,"BACKGROUND: Although Amyloid-beta and Tau are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), other protein pathways such as endothelial dysfunction may be involved and may precede cognitive symptoms. Our objective was to characterize the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles focusing on cardiometabolic-related protein pathways in individuals on the AD spectrum.
METHODS: We performed CSF and plasma-targeted proteomics (276 proteins) from 354 participants of the Brain Stress Hypertension and Aging Program (BSHARP), of which 8% had preclinical AD, and 24% had MCI due to AD. We instituted a bioinformatic pipeline to generate data-driven protein modules, used ""Hub"" and ""Critical"" proteins within each module to describe protein signatures for each AD stage and then assessed their associations with clinical and biological AD traits. Finally, we completed pathway enrichment analysis to get insight into pathways that might be implicated in AD pathogenesis.
RESULTS: The 276 measured proteins clustered into five modules that were associated with CSF Amyloid-β42, Tau, and pTau. (all p-value &lt;0.05). A CSF protein AD signature was characterized by elevated levels of CSF Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Intercellular and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), Neuropilin 1 and 2 (NRP-1, NRP-2), Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 2(SCARB2), Plasminogen Activator, Urokinase (PLAU). (all &lt;0.05) We also found a significant difference in the CSF/Plasma ratio for the proteins associated with Cognitive Status and the Tau/Aβ42 ratio (TAR) in the CSF. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that cell adhesion and endothelial dysfunction (all p-value &lt;0.05) were key mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, especially in the preclinical stage.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a proteomic signature in the CSF of individuals with preclinical AD that is driven by adhesion molecules and might be implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Future studies investigating these pathways may provide insights into novel AD biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Res Sq,2025
40189831,Addressing overfitting bias due to sample overlap in polygenic risk scoring.,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies on Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores (PRSs) overlook sample overlap between International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and target datasets like Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
METHODS: To address this, we developed overlap-adjusted PRS (OA PRS) and tested it on simulated data to assess biases from different scenarios by varying training, testing, and overlap proportions. OA PRS was used to adjust for sample bias in simulations; then, we applied OA PRS to IGAP and ADNI datasets and validated through visual diagnosis.
RESULTS: OA PRS effectively adjusted for sample overlap in all simulation scenarios, as well as for IGAP and ADNI. The original IGAP PRS showed an inflated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC: 0.915) on overlapping samples. OA PRS reduced the AUROC to 0.726, closely aligning with the AUROC of non-overlapping samples (0.712). Further, visual diagnostics confirmed the effectiveness of our adjustments.
DISCUSSION: With OA PRS, we were able to adjust the IGAP summary-based PRS for the overlapped ADNI samples, allowing the dataset to be fully used without the risk of overfitting.
HIGHLIGHTS: Sample overlap between large Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohorts poses overfitting bias when using AD polygenic risk scores (PRSs). This study highlighted the effectiveness of overlap-adjusted PRS (OA -PRS) in mitigating overfitting and improving the accuracy of PRS estimations. New PRSs based on adjusted effect sizes showed increased power in association with clinical features.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39737971,Higher skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity is associated with preserved brain structure up to over a decade.,"Impaired muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity is associated with future cognitive impairment, and higher levels of PET and blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration. Here, we examine its associations with up to over a decade-long changes in brain atrophy and microstructure. Higher in vivo skeletal muscle oxidative capacity via MR spectroscopy (post-exercise recovery rate, k<sub>PCr</sub>) is associated with less ventricular enlargement and brain aging progression, and less atrophy in specific regions, notably primary sensorimotor cortex, temporal white and gray matter, thalamus, occipital areas, cingulate cortex, and cerebellum white matter. Higher k<sub>PCr</sub> is also associated with less microstructural integrity decline in white matter around cingulate, including superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, and cingulum. Higher in vivo muscle oxidative capacity is associated with preserved brain structure up to over a decade, particularly in areas important for cognition, motor function, and sensorimotor integration.",Nat Commun,2024
39901180,Cellular senescence induced by cholesterol accumulation is mediated by lysosomal ABCA1 in APOE4 and AD.,"BACKGROUND: Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cholesterol accumulation is known to drive cellular senescence; however, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis, and its expression and trafficking are altered in APOE4 and AD models. However, the role of ABCA1 trafficking in cellular senescence associated with APOE4 and AD remains unclear.
METHODS: We examined the association between cellular senescence and ABCA1 expression in human postmortem brain samples using transcriptomic, histological, and biochemical analyses. Unbiased proteomic screening was performed to identify the proteins that mediate cellular ABCA1 trafficking. We created ABCA1 knock out cell lines and mouse models to validate the role of ABCA1 in cholesterol-induced mTORC1 activation and senescence. Additionally, we used APOE4-TR mice and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to explore cholesterol-ABCA1-senescence pathways.
RESULTS: Transcriptomic profiling of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from the Religious Order Study/Memory Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort revealed the upregulation of cellular senescence transcriptome signatures in AD, which correlated with ABCA1 expression and oxysterol levels. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses confirmed increased lipofuscin-stained lipids and ABCA1 expression in AD brains and an association with mTOR phosphorylation. Discovery proteomics identified caveolin-1, a sensor of cellular cholesterol accumulation, as a key promoter of ABCA1 endolysosomal trafficking. Greater caveolin-1 expression was observed in APOE4-TR mouse models and AD human brains. Oxysterol induced mTORC1 activation and senescence were regulated by ABCA1 lysosomal trapping. Treatment of APOE4-TR mice with cyclodextrin reduced brain oxysterol levels, ABCA1 lysosome trapping, mTORC1 activation, and attenuated senescence and neuroinflammation markers. In human iPSC-derived astrocytes, the reduction of cholesterol by cyclodextrin attenuated inflammatory responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Oxysterol accumulation in APOE4 and AD induced ABCA1 and caveolin-1 expression, contributing to lysosomal dysfunction and increased cellular senescence markers. This study provides novel insights into how cholesterol metabolism accelerates features of brain cellular senescence pathway and identifies therapeutic targets to mitigate these processes.",Mol Neurodegener,2025

39882022,Dehydroamino acids and their crosslinks in Alzheimer's disease aggregates.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, which are thought to be influenced by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Dehydroamino acids (DHAAs) are rarely observed PTMs that contain an electrophilic alkene capable of forming protein-protein crosslinks, which may lead to protein aggregation. We report here the discovery of DHAAs in the protein aggregates from AD, constituting an unknown and previously unsuspected source of extensive proteomic complexity. We used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to discover 404 sites of DHAA formation in 171 proteins from protein aggregate-enriched human brain samples, 6-fold more sites than observed in the soluble protein fractions. The DHAA modifications are observed both directly and in the form of conjugates after reacting with abundant cellular nucleophiles or crosslinking to nucleophilic amino acid residues. We report 11 such crosslinks, including three in the Tau protein, which are 10-fold more abundant in AD samples compared with age-matched controls. Many of the proteins found to contain DHAAs and their conjugates are involved in protein aggregation or pathways dysregulated in AD. DHAAs are prevalent modifications in the AD brain proteome and give rise to protein crosslinks that may contribute to protein aggregation.",Brain Commun,2025
39764391,Neuroprotective role of sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-11 in humanized transgenic mice.,"Brain aging is a chronic process linked to inflammation, microglial activation, and oxidative damage, which can ultimately lead to neuronal loss. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-11 (SIGLEC-11) is a human lineage-specific microglial cell surface receptor that recognizes α-2-8-linked oligo-/polysialylated glycomolecules with inhibitory effects on the microglial inflammatory pathways. Recently, the SIGLEC11 gene locus was prioritized as a top tier microglial gene with potential causality to Alzheimer's disease, although its role in inflammation and neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. In this study, aged Siglec-11 transgenic (tg) mice, which expressed the human SIGLEC-11 receptor on microglia and tissue macrophages, were investigated. The brains of the Siglec-11 tg mice were analyzed in 6-month-old mature mice and 24-month-old aged mice using immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics. Results showed decreased density and fewer clusters of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-positive microglial cells in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, as well as less lipid-laden microglia in the Siglec-11 tg in comparison to wildtype (WT) controls. Additionally, Siglec-11 tg mice exhibited less age-related neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta in comparison to WT mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and inflammatory pathways in Siglec-11 tg brains at 6 months, with further suppression of complement and coagulation cascades at 24 months of age in comparison to WT mice. Gene transcript levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1β) as well as the oxidative stress markers cytochrome b-245 alpha and beta (Cyba and Cybb) and the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), were reduced in the brains of 24-month-old Siglec-11 tg mice relative to WT controls. Brains of 24-month-old Siglec-11 tg mice also exhibited lower gene transcription of complement components 3, 4, and integrin alpha M (C3, C4, and Itgam), along with the complement C1q subcomponents a-c (C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc). In summary, aged Siglec-11 tg mice displayed reduced brain inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as protection against age-related neuronal loss in the substantia nigra.",Front Neurosci,2024
39898049,Extracellular vesicles contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise training in APP/PS1 mice.,"Exercise improves cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via mechanism that are not fully clear. Here, we first examined the effect of voluntary exercise training (VET) on energy metabolism and cognitive function in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse (Tg) model of familial AD. Next, we profiled extracellular vesicles (EVs) and examined whether they may play a role in the protective effects of VET via intranasal administration of EVs, purified from the blood of sedentary (sEV) and/or acutely exercised (eEV) donor wild-type mice into APP/PS1Tg mice. We show that VET reduced resting energy expenditure (REE) and improved cognition in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Administration of eEV, but not sEV, also reduced REE, but had no effect on cognition. Taken together, these data show that exercise is effective intervention to improve symptoms of AD in APP/PS1Tg mice. In addition, eEVs mediate some of these effects, implicating EVs in the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",iScience,2025

39688327,Alzheimer's Disease Risk Gene SORL1 Promotes Receptiveness of Human Microglia to Pro-Inflammatory Stimuli.,"Sorting protein-related receptor containing class A repeats (SORLA) is an intracellular trafficking receptor encoded by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene SORL1 (sortilin-related receptor 1). Recent findings argue that altered expression in microglia may underlie the genome-wide risk of AD seen with some SORL1 gene variants, however, the functional significance of the receptor in microglia remains poorly explained. Using unbiased omics and targeted functional analyses in iPSC-based human microglia, we identified a crucial role for SORLA in sensitizing microglia to pro-inflammatory stimuli. We show that SORLA acts as a sorting factor for the pattern recognition receptor CD14, directing CD14 exposure on the cell surface and priming microglia to stimulation by pro-inflammatory factors. Loss of SORLA in gene-targeted microglia impairs proper CD14 sorting and blunts pro-inflammatory responses. Our studies indicate an important role for SORLA in shaping the inflammatory brain milieu, a biological process important to local immune responses in AD.",Glia,2025
39992714,Chronic RNA G-quadruplex accumulation in aging and Alzheimer's disease.,"As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we examined human hippocampal postmortem tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD. We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons with the accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation is linked to proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for future treatments and diagnoses.",Elife,2025
39819945,Detection of Elder Abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians Screening Tool Revision for Home-Based Primary Care (DETECT-RPC): a cluster randomised controlled trial study protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: The annual prevalence of elder mistreatment (EM) in cognitively intact older adults is estimated to be 11%, yet the annual prevalence in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) is estimated to be as high as 75%. Associated with a decrease in quality of life and increase in risk of mortality, EM represents a significant public health burden. Home-based primary care (HBPC) providers are uniquely positioned to address the critical need for robust EM screening and reporting, especially among individuals with AD/ADRD. This protocol seeks to adapt the Detection of Elder mistreatment Through Emergency Care Technicians (DETECT) screening tool, previously used by emergency medical technicians, for use by HBPC providers.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The protocol consists of two main phases which include four substudies. Substudy 1 uses a qualitative approach to understand the current barriers to clinician identification and reporting of EM in HBPC, including what adaptations need to be made to DETECT for use in HBPC. Substudy 2 is a cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of Detection of Elder Abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians Screening Tool Revision for Home-Based Primary Care (DETECT-RPC) on clinician identification of older adult patients with increased risk of EM and referring their concerns to the appropriate authorities and service providers. Substudies 3 and 4 apply a mixed-methods approach to postscreening interviews with clinicians and caregiver/care recipient dyads, respectively. These substudies aim to evaluate DETECT-RPC's impact on barriers to EM identification and reporting as well as the harms and benefits of using the screening tool from the perspective of patients and their caregivers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All components of this study are conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (HSC-SPH-22-0732, HSC-SPH-23-0105, HSC-SPH-23-0965, HSC-SPH-24-0123).

39876820,Regional brain iron correlates with transcriptional and cellular signatures in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The link between overload brain iron and transcriptional/cellular signatures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains inconclusive.
METHODS: Iron deposition in 41 cortical and subcortical regions of 30 AD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs) was measured using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The expression of 15,633 genes was estimated in the same regions using transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). Partial least square (PLS) regression was used to identify the association between the healthy brain gene transcription and aberrant regional QSM signal in AD. The biological processes and cell types associated with the linked genes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Gene ontological analyses showed that the first PLS component (PLS1) genes were enriched for biological processes relating to the ""protein phosphorylation"" and ""metal ion transport"". Additionally, these genes were expressed in microglia (MG) and glutamatergic neurons (GLUs).
DISCUSSION: Our findings provide mechanistic insights from transcriptional and cellular signatures into regional iron accumulation measured by QSM in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Spatial patterns of iron deposition changes in AD correlate with cortical spatial expression genes in healthy subjects. The identified gene transcription profile underlies aberrant iron accumulation in AD was enriched for biological processes relating to ""protein phosphorylation"" and ""metal ion transport"". The related genes were predominantly expressed in MG and GLUs.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40145342,Biomarkers of blood-brain barrier and neurovascular unit integrity in human cognitive impairment and dementia.,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is recognized as an early step in the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Biomarkers are needed to monitor BBB integrity over time, better understand the role of the BBB in neurodegeneration, potentially help define long-term ADRD risk, and monitor effects of therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the current biomarkers used to detect human BBB dysfunction in the context of cognitive decline and dementia. We also discuss promising candidate fluid biomarkers to detect BBB dysfunction in blood. HIGHLIGHTS: BBB permeability occurs during normal aging and is further exacerbated in ADRD. In this review, we discuss in vivo imaging and CSF biomarkers of BBB dysfunction currently used in the setting of aging and ADRD in humans. We also review promising candidate blood-based biomarkers that may represent BBB dysfunction.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39711489,Co-pathologies modify hippocampal protein accumulation patterns in neurodegenerative diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: Limited research has extensively analyzed neurodegenerative disease-related protein deposition patterns in the hippocampus.
METHODS: This study examined the distribution of proteins in hippocampal subregions across major neurodegenerative diseases and explored their relation to each other. The area density of phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid beta (Aβ), α-synuclein, and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein deposits together with pyramidal cell density in each hippocampal subregion, including CA1-4, prosubiculum (ProS), and subiculum was assessed in 166 cases encompassing various neurodegenerative diseases.
RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease-associated p-tau predominated in ProS, Aβ in the CA1, and Lewy body-related α-synuclein in the CA2. The area density of protein deposits increased with the pathological stage until a peak, then decreased in cases with high pathology stages along with pyramidal cell density. Comorbid protein pathology influenced protein deposition patterns.
DISCUSSION: This comprehensive evaluation reveals characteristic neurodegenerative disease-related protein accumulation patterns in hippocampal subregions modified by co-pathologies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease-related phosphorylated tau predominates in the prosubiculum. Amyloid beta predominates in the CA1 and Lewy body-related α-synuclein in the CA2. The area density of protein deposition increases with the disease stage up to a peak. In the high pathology stage, protein deposition and pyramidal cell density decreases.

39801715,Impaired semantic control in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia.,"We investigated semantic cognition in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including (i) the status of verbal and non-verbal semantic performance; and (ii) whether the semantic deficit reflects impaired semantic control. Our a priori hypothesis that individuals with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia would exhibit semantic control impairments was motivated by the anatomical overlap between the temporoparietal atrophy typically associated with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and lesions associated with post-stroke semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia, which cause heteromodal semantic control impairments. We addressed the presence, type (semantic representation and semantic control; verbal and non-verbal), and progression of semantic deficits in logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Since most people with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia have Alzheimer's disease pathology and are part of a broader multi-dimensional phenotype space encompassing Alzheimer's disease sub-types, we compared semantic performance in logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease. Given the differences in lesion and atrophy patterns in semantic aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia versus semantic-dementia/semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia patients, our second aim was to examine atrophy patterns in people with logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and typical Alzheimer's disease compared to age-matched controls. Twenty-seven patients participated in the study. People were grouped into those meeting consensus criteria for logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (N = 10) and others who may have previously satisfied definitions of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia but had progressed with multi-domain cognitive impairments (herein referred to as 'logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia+'; N = 8). People with typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease (N = 9) were relatively preserved across verbal and non-verbal semantic assessments. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia patients were impaired on both verbal and non-verbal semantic tasks and their impairments showed the hallmark characteristics of a semantic control deficit. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia + patients showed effects of varying semantic control demands, positive cueing effects, and correlated performance between semantic and executive tasks. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, comparing each of the patient groups to age-matched controls, revealed significantly reduced grey and white matter in the bilateral hippocampi and lateral temporal regions in typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia group exhibited an asymmetric pattern of reduced grey and white matter intensity in the language-dominant left hemisphere, including a significant portion of the lateral and medial temporal lobe. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia + patients demonstrated reduced grey and white matter in the left temporal lobe extending sub-cortically, anteriorly and posteriorly, as well as right temporal involvement. Our findings could aid diagnostic sub-typing of primary progressive aphasia by adopting semantic control features and offer improved clinical characterization of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia in the trajectory of semantic decline.",Brain Commun,2025
39748844,Predicting regional tau accumulation with machine learning-based tau-PET and advanced radiomics.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is partially characterized by the progressive accumulation of aggregated tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Although the association between accumulated tau, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline is critical for disease understanding and clinical trial design, we still lack robust tools to predict individualized trajectories of tau accumulation. Our objective was to assess whether brain imaging biomarkers of flortaucipir-positron emission tomography (PET), in combination with clinical and genomic measures, could predict future pathological tau accumulation.
METHODS: We quantified the disease profile of participants (N = 276) using a comprehensive set of descriptors, including clinical/demographic (age, diagnosis, amyloid status, sex, race, ethnicity), genetic (apolipoprotein E [APOE]-ε4), and flortaucipir-PET imaging measures (regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr] and comprehensive radiomic texture features extracted from Automated Anatomical Labeling template regions). We trained an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm in a 2:1 split train-test configuration to derive a prognostic index that (i) stratifies individualized brain regions including global (AD-signature region) and lobar regions (frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal) into stable/slow- and fast-progressors based on future tau accumulation, and (ii) forecasts individualized regional annualized-rate-of-change in flortaucipir-PET SUVr. Further, we developed an adaptive model incorporating flortaucipir-PET measurements from the baseline and intermediate timepoints to predict annualized-rate-of-change.
RESULTS: In binary classification for predicting stable/slow- versus fast-progressors, the area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.86 in the AD-signature region and 0.83, 0.82, 0.84, and 0.83 in frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions, respectively. The trained models successfully predicted annualized-rate-of-change of flortaucipir-PET regional flortaucipir SUVr in AD-signature and lobar regions (Pearson-correlation [R]: AD-signature = 0.73; frontal = 0.73; occipital = 0.71; parietal = 0.70; temporal = 0.69). The models' performance in predicting annualized-rate-of-change slightly increased when imaging features from intermediate timepoints were used in the adaptive setting (R: AD-signature = 0.79; frontal = 0.87; occipital = 0.83; parietal = 0.74; temporal = 0.82).
DISCUSSION: Taken together, our results propose a robust approach to predict future tau accumulation that may improve the ability to enroll, stratify, and gauge efficacy in clinical trial participants.
HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning predicts the future rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.Tau prediction in lobar/global regions benefits from diverse multimodal features.This prognostic index can serve as a sensitive tool for patient stratification.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
40103929,Associations of varicose veins with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies in adults without dementia: the CABLE study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found a correlation between varicose veins (VVs) and cognitive decline, and individuals with VVs have a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the associations between VVs and the core pathologies of AD have not yet been investigated. The research was designed to analyze the relationships between VVs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathologies.
METHODS: We included 1,298 participants from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) database without dementia. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was applied to assess the relationships between the VVs and CSF AD biomarkers. Then, we conducted subgroup analyses according to age, gender, education levels and apolipoprotein E genotype ε4 (APOE-ε4) carrier status. Additionally, mediation effects were assessed using causal mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations.
RESULTS: In total subjects, VVs had negative correlations with CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> (β = -0.157, p = 0.038) and CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio (β = -0.272, p &lt; 0.001), as well as positive correlations with CSF Aβ<sub>40</sub> (β = 0.170, p = 0.024), CSF p-tau (β = 0.192, p = 0.008), CSF t-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio (β = 0.190, p = 0.011), and CSF p-tau/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio (β = 0.248, p = 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex, education levels and APOE-ε4 carrier status. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the relations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers were more significant in female, mid-life adults (40-65 years), less-educated individuals and APOE-ε4 non-carriers. Moreover, CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio might be a partial mediator of the association between VVs and p-tau pathology.
CONCLUSION: Our study found correlations between VVs and CSF AD biomarkers, suggesting that VVs may be a potential risk factor for the development of AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40134265,Assessment of instrumental activities of daily living in patients with cognitive impairment based on their ability to use household appliances.,"BackgroundDetecting life disability is crucial in diagnosing dementia; however, early detection has proven challenging with previous assessment scales. This study focused on an individual's ability to use household appliances as a means of detecting life disability.ObjectiveThe objectives of this study are threefold: (1) to compare the ability to use household appliances between the non-dementia and dementia groups, (2) to determine whether the level of life disability based on the ability to use appliances is at the level of diagnosed dementia or non-dementia, and (3) to explore the impact of age and gender on the ability to use appliances.MethodsWe selected 13 essential household appliances for elderly individuals and proposed an instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) assessment tool to evaluate their usage. Our sample consisted of 98 patients with cognitive impairment, divided into a non-dementia group (N = 34) and a dementia group (N = 64). Most participants in the dementia group had Alzheimer's disease or related conditions. Through multiple logistic regression, the model equation aimed to determine whether a subject's functional disability indicated a potential dementia diagnosis.ResultsThe optimal model equation identified the microwave oven and air conditioner as key factors, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. Additionally, analysis by age and gender enhanced the discriminative power of the results.ConclusionsOur proposed scoring system can efficiently determine the degree of life disability by assessing appliance usage, demonstrating comparable discriminatory ability to existing scales.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39966464,Aβ<sub>42</sub> induces stress granule formation via PACT/PKR pathway.,"Stress granule (SG) formation has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) is a key player in the pathogenesis of AD and is known to trigger various stress-related signaling pathways. However, the impact of Aβ on SG formation has not been fully understood. The primary aim of this study is to analyze the SG-inducing properties of Aβ42 and to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Our results revealed that exposure to 20 μM Aβ42 led to a significant SG formation in neuroblastoma-derived (SH-SY5Y) and glioma-derived (U87) cell lines. Interestingly, we observed elevated levels of p-eIF2α, while overall protein translation levels remained unchanged. Monomeric and oligomeric forms of Aβ42 exhibited a 4-5 times stronger ability to induce SG formation compared to fibrillar forms. Additionally, treatment with familial mutants of Aβ42 (Dutch and Flemish) showed distinct effects on SG induction. Moreover, our findings using eIF2α kinases knockout (KO) cell lines demonstrated that Aβ-induced SG formation is primarily dependent on Protein Kinase R (PKR). Subsequent proximity ligation assay (PLA) analysis revealed a close proximity of PACT and PKR in Aβ-treated cells and in AD mouse hippocampus. Taken together, our study suggests that Aβ42 promotes SG formation through PKR kinase activation, which in turn requires PACT involvement.",Sci Rep,2025
39740372,Subtypes of brain change in aging and their associations with cognition and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.,"Structural brain changes underlie cognitive changes and interindividual variability in cognition in older age. By using structural MRI data-driven clustering, we aimed to identify subgroups of cognitively unimpaired older adults based on brain change patterns and assess how changes in cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume relate to cognitive change. We tested (1) which brain structural changes predict cognitive change (2) whether these are associated with core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and (3) the degree of overlap between clusters derived from different structural modalities in 1899 cognitively healthy older adults followed up to 16 years. We identified four groups for each brain feature, based on the degree of a main longitudinal component of decline. The minimal overlap between features suggested that each contributed uniquely and independently to structural brain changes in aging. Cognitive change and baseline cognition were associated with cortical area change, whereas higher baseline levels of phosphorylated tau and amyloid-β related to changes in subcortical volume. These results may contribute to a better understanding of different aging trajectories.",Neurobiol Aging,2025

In Japan, dementia is the most significant reason recognized for people requiring nursing care. Protein is one of the possible preventive nutrients for dementia; however, adequate intake levels can differ according to usual protein intakes and protein sources.ObjectiveThis study examined the relationships between disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for Alzheimer's disease and protein or amino acid intakes.MethodsGlobal Burden of Disease Study data (DALYs for each sex and age group in each year) and de-identified individual records from the National Health and Nutrition Survey Japan (data from 46,831 subjects) from 2001 to 2019 were used. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationships between DALYs and protein or amino acid intakes with lifestyle factors and sociodemographic index as confounding factors.ResultsHigher protein-to-energy ratios were correlated with lower DALYs in women in their 70 s (partial regression coefficient [Coeff.] = -349.488, p = 0.034), in men in their 60 s (Coeff. = -51.484), and in both sexes combined in their 60 s (Coeff. = -26.696, p = 0.015) even after adjusting for other possible nutrient intakes. Additionally, elevated isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine, histidine, arginine, alanine, asparagine, and glycine levels were correlated with lower DALYs in women in their 70 s (Coeff. = -2.752 to -0.141).ConclusionsAdequate protein and specific amino acid intakes may be associated with DALYs for Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39939901,Efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on reducing hippocampal atrophy rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are conditions characterized by irreversible progressive degeneration to the nervous tissue and are usually associated with cognitive decline and functional deficits, especially in elderly. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) like donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are commonly prescribed to alleviate cognitive symptoms associated with NDs. However, their long-term impact on slowing structural brain degeneration, particularly hippocampal atrophy, remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the efficacy of AChEIs in reducing hippocampal atrophy in patients with NDs or clinical syndromes that lead to cognitive decline.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases, since inception till 20th August 2024, identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative studies that measured hippocampal volume changes in elderly patients with NDs and other clinical syndromes. Random effect model was employed to estimate the pooled atrophy rates. Subgroup analysis was conducted by disease, dosage, and side of the measurement.
RESULTS: From 5,943 initially screened studies, nine were included in the review, and six were analyzed in the meta-analysis, encompassing a total of 2,179 participants. The meta-analysis showed that donepezil at a 10 mg dose significantly reduced hippocampal atrophy compared to placebo (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI [0.08 to 0.81], p = 0.01), whereas the 5 mg dose showed no significant effect on hippocampal volume. Overall, pooled results favored donepezil in reducing hippocampal atrophy (SMD = 0.33, p = 0.04), indicating that higher doses are more effective. Among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), both donepezil and vitamin E were associated with a significant reduction in hippocampal atrophy compared to placebo (SMD = 0.27, p = 0.01). In contrast, galantamine did not significantly reduce hippocampal atrophy in the overall analysis, but it was associated with reduced whole brain atrophy in APOE ε4 carriers. Further analysis revealed no significant difference in the reduction of right or left hippocampal atrophy in donepezil-treated patients. These findings suggest that donepezil, particularly at higher doses, may have a protective effect against hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD and MCI, while galantamine's effect may be more limited, especially in certain genetic subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Higher doses of donepezil (10 mg) significantly reduce hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, suggesting potential neuroprotective effects. In contrast, lower doses (5 mg) and galantamine showed no significant impact on hippocampal volume, though galantamine reduced whole brain atrophy in APOE ε4 carriers. Dosage and genetic factors are crucial in determining the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in slowing neurodegeneration.",BMC Neurol,2025
40116675,Virtual reality-based interventions for individuals with dementia: A potential further treatment and new perspectives.,"This commentary highlights issues regarding virtual reality (VR)-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing their potential to improve cognitive function and delay decline. The aim of this manuscript is to present current findings and critically synthesize the practical applications of VR interventions. A recent meta-analysis demonstrates promising results, with VR interventions enhancing memory, executive functions, and overall cognition. Despite the limited number of studies and small sample sizes, findings suggest that engaging VR environments can motivate patients, fostering adherence to treatment. This commentary underscores the need for further research to validate these results and establish standardized methodologies for the effective use of VR in dementia care. Several methodological aspects and new perspectives are highlighted herein.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39713269,An integrated transcriptomic analysis of brain aging and strategies for healthy aging.,"BACKGROUND: It is been noted that the expression levels of numerous genes undergo changes as individuals age, and aging stands as a primary factor contributing to age-related diseases. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether there are common aging genes across organs or tissues, and whether these aging genes play a pivotal role in the development of age-related diseases.
METHODS: In this study, we screened for aging genes using RNAseq data of 32 human tissues from GTEx. RNAseq datasets from GEO were used to study whether aging genes drives age-related diseases, or whether anti-aging solutions could reverse aging gene expression.
RESULTS: Aging transcriptome alterations showed that brain aging differ significantly from the rest of the body, furthermore, brain tissues were divided into four group according to their aging transcriptome alterations. Numerous genes were downregulated during brain aging, with functions enriched in synaptic function, ubiquitination, mitochondrial translation and autophagy. Transcriptome analysis of age-related diseases and retarding aging solutions showed that downregulated aging genes in the hippocampus further downregulation in Alzheimer's disease but were effectively reversed by high physical activity. Furthermore, the neuron loss observed during aging was reversed by high physical activity.
CONCLUSION: The downregulation of many genes is a major contributor to brain aging and neurodegeneration. High levels of physical activity have been shown to effectively reactivate these genes, making it a promising strategy to slow brain aging.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
39857687,A Network Pharmacology Study and Experimental Validation to Identify the Potential Mechanism of Heparan Sulfate on Alzheimer's Disease-Related Neuroinflammation.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Heparan sulfate (HS) is a polysaccharide that is found on the surface of cells and has various biological functions in the body.
METHODS: The purpose of this study was to predict the pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of HS on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuroinflammation (NI) through a network pharmacology analysis and to experimentally verify them.
RESULTS: We performed functional enrichment analysis of common genes between HS target genes and AD-NI gene sets and obtained items such as the ""Cytokine-Mediated Signaling Pathway"", ""Positive Regulation Of MAPK Cascade"", and ""MAPK signaling pathway"". To confirm the predicted results, the anti-inflammatory effect of HS was investigated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. HS inhibited the production of nittic oxide, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, but not IL-1β. In addition, HS inactivated P38 in the MAPK signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential for HS to become a new treatment for AD and NI.",Biomedicines,2025
39710824,Comparative Analysis of Human Brain RNA-seq Reveals the Combined Effects of Ferroptosis and Autophagy on Alzheimer's Disease in Multiple Brain Regions.,"Ferroptosis and autophagy are closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated ferric ion levels can induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory responses, resulting in brain tissue damage and further neurological cell damage. Autophagy in Alzheimer's has a dual role. On one hand, it protects neurons by removing β-amyloid and cellular damage products caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. On the other hand, abnormal autophagy is linked to neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration. However, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and autophagy in AD remains insufficiently explored. This study focuses on the roles of ferroptosis and autophagy in AD and their interconnection through bioinformatics analysis, shedding light on the disease. Ferroptosis and autophagy significantly correlate with the development and course of AD. Using PPI network analysis and unsupervised consistency clustering analysis, we uncovered a complex network of interactions between ferroptosis and autophagy during disease progression, demonstrating a significant congruence in their modification patterns. Functional analyses further demonstrated that ferroptosis and autophagy together affect the immunological status and synaptic regulation in hippocampal regions in patients with AD, which significantly impacts the start and progression of the disease.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
40189792,Platelets mirror changes in the frontal lobe antioxidant system in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Blood biomarkers reflecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology can improve diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: We applied top-down proteomics to compare frontal lobe from 17 AD cases and 11 controls to blood platelets from a second independent study group of 124 AD patients, 61 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 168 controls. Findings were immunologically validated.
RESULTS: Sixty AD-associated proteoforms were identified in frontal lobe, with 26 identically represented in platelets. Validation in platelet samples confirmed elevated glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) levels linked to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4925 and increased superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) levels in AD. Bioinformatics revealed copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) as integral partners of these antioxidant enzymes. Both were detected to be reduced in frontal lobes and platelets in AD. SOD1 and CCS are already changed in MCI.
DISCUSSION: These four novel blood biomarkers, integrated with traditional AD biomarkers, may facilitate patient risk assessment and treatment, with SOD1 and CCS alterations in MCI offering early diagnostic potential.
HIGHLIGHTS: Platelets mirror several Alzheimer's disease (AD)-dependent neuronal changes, valuable for blood tests. As a start, 60 AD-associated frontal lobe proteins were identified by top-down proteomics. Fifty percent of these 60 AD-affected brain proteins are represented identically in platelets. Among these, glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) are identically AD related in brain and platelets. SOD1 and its crucial activating partner CCS are altered in the platelets of patients with mild cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39752101,Differential Expression of GABA Receptor-Related Genes in Alzheimer's Disease and the Positive Regulatory Role of Aerobic Exercise-From Genetic Screening to D-gal-induced AD-like Pathology Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The neuropathology of AD appears in the hippocampus. The purpose of this work was to reveal key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus of AD patients and healthy individuals. Furthermore, we established an in vivo AD-like model to validate and explore the effects of exercise on these risky genes. The datasets GSE36980 and GSE48350 were downloaded from the GEO database and visualized using R packages to obtain DEGs. Subsequently, the potential biological functions of these DEGs were predicted, PPI network interactions were screened for core genes, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, we determined the diagnostic value of core DEGs using ROC curves. Single-cell analysis was used to verify the cell type specificity of hub genes. Finally, we used RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to validate the expression of core DEGs in model mice and to explore the beneficial mechanisms of exercise. A total of 13 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the development of AD were identified, comprising 11 down-regulated genes and 2 up-regulated genes. PPI network visualization acquired four down-regulated core DEGs with good diagnostic value. The findings from the in vivo study indicated that the mRNA expression of GABRA1, GABRG2, and SVOP decreased, and the astrocyte marker GFAP notably increased in AD mice. Surprisingly, exercise increased hippocampal GABRA1 and GABRG2 expression and decreased GFAP-positive intensity of GABRG1 localization, reducing expression of inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-1β. In addition, exercise improved the spatial exploration ability but had little effect on the preference index in AD mice. Our data highlighted the mechanism by which exercise improves memory performance in AD patients by reducing astrocyte neurotoxicity inducing decreased hippocampal GABA receptor expression.",Neuromolecular Med,2024
40025720,IL-34/TREM2 modulates microglia-mediated inflammation and provides neuroprotection in a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: As a recently identified cytokine, interleukin-34 (IL-34) is predominantly produced by neurons and functions as a modulator for glial functions. Emerging evidence indicates that IL-34 exerted neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanism remained elusive.
OBJECTIVE: To uncover the mechanisms by which IL-34 provides neuroprotection in AD.
METHODS: Using senescence-accelerated mouse prone substrain 8 (SAMP8) mice, a well-established model for sporadic AD, we investigated the dynamic changes in brain IL-34 concentrations during AD progression. Afterwards, SAMP8 mice received a 4-week continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of IL-34. Morris water maze test was employed to assess the spatial cognitive functions. Neuronal and synaptic markers, oxidative stress makers, pro-inflammatory cytokines and glial activation markers in the brains of SAMP8 mice were measured. Finally, amyloid-β (Aβ)<sub>42</sub>-stimulated primary microglia, lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown strategy and co-immunoprecipitation assay were utilized to uncover the possible mechanisms by which IL-34 exerted neuroprotection in AD.
RESULTS: In SAMP8 mice, we revealed that brain IL-34 concentrations gradually decreased during AD progression. A 4-week continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of IL-34 rescued spatial cognitive impairments, ameliorated neuronal and synaptic damage, and suppressed oxidative stress and microglia-mediated inflammation in the brains of SAMP8 mice. Using Aβ<sub>42</sub>-stimulated primary microglia, we demonstrated for the first time that IL-34 suppressed microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines release by interacting with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a key regulator of microglial functions.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover the mechanisms by which IL-34 provides neuroprotection in AD, indicating that IL-34/TREM2 signaling may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for this devastating disease.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39837326,Parental origin of transgene modulates amyloid-β plaque burden in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, the 5xFAD mouse model is commonly used as a heterozygote crossed with other genetic models to study AD pathology. We investigated whether the parental origin of the 5xFAD transgene affects plaque deposition. Using quantitative light-sheet microscopy, we found that paternal inheritance of the transgene led to a 2-fold higher plaque burden compared with maternal inheritance, a finding consistent across multiple 5xFAD colonies. This effect was not due to gestation in or rearing by 5xFAD females. Immunoblotting suggested that transgenic inheritance modulates transgenic protein expression, potentially due to genomic imprinting of the Thy1.2 promoter. Surprisingly, fewer than 20% of 5xFAD studies report breeding schemes, suggesting that this factor might confound previous findings. Our data highlight a significant determinant of plaque burden in 5xFAD mice and underscore the importance of reporting the parental origin of the transgene to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility in AD research.",Neuron,2025
40119826,The Association of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment With Outpatient Ambulatory Care Utilization in the Community.,"BACKGROUND: Ambulatory care is critical in delivering interventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from basic services to novel therapeutics. Yet, little is known regarding how community-dwelling persons with dementia/MCI interact with clinicians in outpatient ambulatory settings. We assessed associations of dementia/MCI with outpatient ambulatory evaluation and management (E&M) visits.
METHODS: We included 2116 community-dwelling participants in Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts, with linked fee-for-service Medicare claims. Annually from 2011 to 2019, cohort neuropsychologic evaluations classified participants as dementia, MCI, or no cognitive impairment (NCI). Across groups, we compared annual probability of visiting providers and number of E&M visits, using repeated measures logistic or generalized Poisson mixed effects models.
RESULTS: Across 8672 person-years (PY) of follow-up, the mean age was 82 (SD 7.6) years; 77% of PYs were among females and 24% among Black participants. Controlling for demographics and comorbidity, the annual predicted probability of primary care visits was high in all groups (86%-92%). Although there were few visits with dementia-related specialists, we found a higher probability of these visits among those with dementia (15%) and MCI (17%) than NCI (12%; p = 0.009, dementia vs. NCI; p < 0.001, MCI vs. NCI). There were striking differences in visits to other medical specialties: the mean number of annual visits was 40% lower for those with dementia (p < 0.001) and 10% lower for MCI (p < 0.001) than NCI. Overall, dementia and MCI were associated with 19% (p < 0.001) and 4% (p = 0.005) fewer E&M visits, respectively, compared to NCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with dementia and MCI interact with primary care providers regularly and are more likely to use dementia-related specialists than those with NCI. Yet, we found lower utilization of other medical specialties, without compensatory increases in primary care, leading to fewer overall E&M visits, even in MCI. Together, the findings may suggest lost opportunities to address the scope of health issues in vulnerable groups.",J Am Geriatr Soc,2025
39982062,"Genetic colocalization of cathepsins H, D, and L1 with Alzheimer's disease: Implications for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery.","BackgroundCathepsins, a family of lysosomal proteases, have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis through their involvement in amyloid-β protein precursor processing and neuroinflammation. However, the specific roles of different cathepsins in AD remain unclear.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the genetic associations and potential causal relationships between cathepsins and AD, using Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore their roles as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.MethodsA two-sample MR analysis was conducted using genome-wide association study data for AD and cathepsins. Genetic variants associated with cathepsin expression were used as instrumental variables. Forward MR assessed the causal effect of cathepsins on AD, while reverse MR explored the impact of AD on cathepsin levels. Colocalization analysis was performed to identify shared genetic variants between cathepsins and AD.ResultsCathepsin H was significantly associated with an increased risk of AD (p = 0.0034, OR = 1.04), with consistent results across multiple MR methods. Colocalization analysis revealed a significant genetic overlap between Cathepsin L1 and AD (PP.H4 = 100%), suggesting a shared genetic basis.ConclusionsCathepsin H may be a potential risk factor for AD, while Cathepsin L1 shows promise as a therapeutic target and biomarker due to its genetic overlap with AD. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms by which these cathepsins influence AD progression and to assess their therapeutic potential in diverse populations.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40129418,Life-long music and dance relationships and therapeutic impressions in individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment to inform the design of music- and dance-based therapies.,"BackgroundNo effective therapies exist to prevent neurodegenerative mild cognitive impairment (MCI) related to Alzheimer's disease. Therapies integrating music and/or dance are promising non-pharmacological options to effectively mitigate cognitive decline.ObjectiveTo deepen our understanding of individuals' relationships (i.e., histories, experiences, and attitudes) with music and dance, in order to incorporate such knowledge into the design of music- and dance-based interventions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes.MethodsEleven older adults with MCI and five of their care partners/ spouses (4 M/12F; Black: n = 4, White: n = 10, Hispanic/Latino: n = 2; Age: 71.4 ± 9.6 years) first completed questionnaires, then participated in focus groups that captured aspects of their relationships with music and dance. Emergent themes were extracted from four major topics, including: (1) experience and history, (2) enjoyment and preferences, (3) confidence and barriers, and (4) impressions of music and dance as therapeutic tools.ResultsThematic analysis revealed participants' positive impressions of music and dance as potential therapeutic interventions, citing perceived neuropsychological, emotional, and physical benefits. Participants viewed music and dance as integral to their lives, histories, and identities within a culture, family, and/ or community. Participants also identified lifelong engagement barriers that, in conjunction with negative feedback, instilled persistent low self-efficacy regarding dancing and active music engagement. Questionnaires verified individuals' moderately-strong music and dance relationships, which were strongest in passive forms of music engagement (e.g., listening).ConclusionsOur findings support that individuals' music and dance relationships and the associated perceptions toward music and dance therapy may offer valuable insights that enhance the design of efficacious and engaging non-pharmacological therapies for individuals with MCI.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39689057,APOE genotype and brain amyloid are associated with changes in the plasma proteome in elderly subjects without dementia.,"OBJECTIVE: Recent work has bolstered the possibility that peripheral changes may be relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in the brain. While age-associated blood-borne proteins have been targeted to restore function to the aged brain, it remains unclear whether other dysfunctional systemic states can be exploited for similar benefits. Here, we investigate whether APOE allelic variation or presence of brain amyloid are associated with plasma proteomic changes and the molecular processes associated with these changes.
METHODS: Using the SOMAscan assay, we measured 1305 plasma proteins from 53 homozygous, APOE3 and APOE4 subjects without dementia. We investigated the relationship of either the APOE-ε4 allele or amyloid positivity with plasma proteome changes by linear mixed effects modeling and ontology-based pathway and module-trait correlation analyses.
RESULTS: APOE4 is associated with plasma protein differences linked to atherosclerosis, tyrosine kinase activity, cholesterol transport, extracellular matrix, and synaptogenesis pathways. Independent of APOE4, we found that subjects likely harboring brain amyloid exhibit plasma proteome signatures associated with AD-linked pathways, including neurovascular dysfunction.
INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that APOE4 status or presence of brain amyloid are associated with plasma proteomic shifts prior to the onset of symptoms, suggesting that systemic pathways in certain risk contexts may be plausible targets for disease modification.",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,2025

40014269,Decoding the Role of Neurotrophins in Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3-Beta Regulation in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent contributor to dementia in elderly individuals. Numerous signalling pathways influencing AD pathophysiology, involving glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Gsk-3β), have been investigated extensively as potential therapeutic targets. Gsk-3β is a critical factor in AD pathogenesis that affects several key hallmarks of the disease notably tau phosphorylation, amyloid-β generation, cognition, neurogenesis, and synaptic integrity. Neurotrophins are small proteins that are critical for maintaining neuronal health and function and may be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the dysregulation of certain neurotrophins and their receptors is also linked with AD which is a major contributor to neurodegeneration. Studies indicated that neurotrophins and their modulators are capable of protecting neurons by blocking the Gsk-3β activity suggesting a potential link for neuroprotection. Neurotrophins support the survival of neurons by regulating Gsk-3β activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling pathways activate Trk receptors that trigger downstream signalling cascades that subsequently inhibit Gsk-3β activity and reduce AD-related neuropathology. We also explore the role of modulators including phosphatases, kinase cascades, and other regulatory proteins that cross paths with neurotrophin-Gsk-3β signalling. In conclusion, this manuscript summarizes both direct and indirect regulatory roles of neurotrophins and modulators on Gsk-3β to understand the intricate mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in AD.",Mol Neurobiol,2025
39956949,"Navigating the blurred boundary: Neuropathologic changes versus clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, and its consequences for research in genetics.","During decades scientists tried to unveil the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recurring to increasingly larger sample numbers for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in hope for higher statistical gains. Here, a retrospective look on the most prominent GWAS was performed, focusing on the quality of the diagnosis associated with the used data and databases. Different methods for AD diagnosis (or absence) carry different levels of accuracy and certainty applied to both subsets of cases and controls. Furthermore, the different phenotypes included in these databases were explored, as several incorporate other ageing comorbidities and might be encompassing many confounding agents as well. Age of the samples' donors and origin populations were also investigated as these could be biasing factors in posterior analyses. A tendency for looser diagnostic methods in more recent GWAS was observed, where greater datasets of individuals are analyzed, which may have been hampering the discovery of associated genetic variants. Specifically for AD, a diagnostic method conveying a clinical outcome may be distinct from the disease neuropathological assessment, since the first has a practical perspective that not necessarily needs a confirmation. Due to its properties and complex diagnosis, this work highlights the importance of the neuropathological confirmation of AD (or its absence) in the subjects considered for research purposes to avoid reaching statistically weak and/or misleading conclusions that may trigger further studies with powerless groundwork.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39702316,Structural and functional alterations of neurons derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease hiPSCs are associated with downregulation of the LIMK1-cofilin axis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of pathological proteins and synaptic dysfunction. This study aims to investigate the molecular and functional differences between human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with sporadic AD (sAD) and age-matched controls (healthy subjects, HS), focusing on their neuronal differentiation and synaptic properties in order to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology.
METHODS: Skin fibroblasts from sAD patients (n = 5) and HS subjects (n = 5) were reprogrammed into hiPSCs using non-integrating Sendai virus vectors. Through karyotyping, we assessed pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, TRA-1-60) and genomic integrity. Neuronal differentiation was evaluated by immunostaining for MAP2 and NEUN. Electrophysiological properties were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp, while protein expression of Aβ, phosphorylated tau, Synapsin-1, Synaptophysin, PSD95, and GluA1 was quantified by western blot. We then focused on PAK1-LIMK1-Cofilin signaling, which plays a key role in regulating synaptic structure and function, both of which are disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
RESULTS: sAD and HS hiPSCs displayed similar stemness features and genomic stability. However, they differed in neuronal differentiation and function. sAD-derived neurons (sAD-hNs) displayed increased levels of AD-related proteins, including Aβ and phosphorylated tau. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that while both sAD- and HS-hNs generated action potentials, sAD-hNs exhibited decreased spontaneous synaptic activity. Significant reductions in the expression of synaptic proteins such as Synapsin-1, Synaptophysin, PSD95, and GluA1 were found in sAD-hNs, which are also characterized by reduced neurite length, indicating impaired differentiation. Notably, sAD-hNs demonstrated a marked reduction in LIMK1 phosphorylation, which could be the underlying cause for the changes in cytoskeletal dynamics that we found, leading to the morphological and functional modifications observed in sAD-hNs. To further investigate the involvement of the LIMK1 pathway in the morphological and functional changes observed in sAD neurons, we conducted perturbation experiments using the specific LIMK1 inhibitor, BMS-5. Neurons obtained from healthy subjects treated with the inhibitor showed similar morphological changes to those observed in sAD neurons, confirming that LIMK1 activity is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal structure. Furthermore, administration of the inhibitor to sAD neurons did not exacerbate the morphological alterations, suggesting that LIMK1 activity is already compromised in these cells.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that although sAD- and HS-hiPSCs are similar in their stemness and genomic stability, sAD-hNs exhibit distinct functional and structural anomalies mirroring AD pathology. These anomalies include synaptic dysfunction, altered cytoskeletal organization, and accumulation of AD-related proteins. Our study underscores the usefulness of hiPSCs in modeling AD and provides insights into the disease's molecular underpinnings, thus highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024

39812331,Predicting Alzheimer's disease subtypes and understanding their molecular characteristics in living patients with transcriptomic trajectory profiling.,"INTRODUCTION: Deciphering the diverse molecular mechanisms in living Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is a big challenge but is pivotal for disease prognosis and precision medicine development.
METHODS: Utilizing an optimal transport approach, we conducted graph-based mapping of transcriptomic profiles to transfer AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to ADNI and ANMerge peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subsequently, differential expression followed by comparative pathway and diffusion pseudotime analysis were applied to each cohort to infer the progression trajectories. Survival analysis with real follow-up time was used to obtain potential biomarkers for AD prognosis.
RESULTS: AD subtype labels were accurately transferred onto the blood samples of ADNI and ANMerge living patients. Pathways and associated genes in neutrophil degranulation-like immune process, immune acute phase response, and IL-6 signaling were significantly associated with AD progression.
DISCUSSION: The work enhanced our understanding of AD progression in different subtypes, offering insights into potential biomarkers and personalized interventions for improved patient care.
HIGHLIGHTS: We applied an innovative optimal transport-based approach to map transcriptomic data from different Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort studies and transfer known AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples within ADNI and ANMerge cohorts. Through comprehensive trajectory and comparative analysis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying different disease progression trajectories in AD. We validated the accuracy of our AD subtype label transfer and identified prognostic genetic markers associated with disease progression, facilitating personalized treatment strategies. By identifying and predicting distinctive AD subtypes and their associated pathways, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of AD heterogeneity.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39814010,CRISPRi-based screens in iAssembloids to elucidate neuron-glia interactions.,"The complexity of the human brain makes it challenging to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying brain function. Genome-wide association studies have uncovered variants associated with neurological phenotypes. Single-cell transcriptomics have provided descriptions of changes brain cells undergo during disease. However, these approaches do not establish molecular mechanism. To facilitate the scalable interrogation of causal molecular mechanisms in brain cell types, we developed a 3D co-culture system of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and glia, termed iAssembloids. Using iAssembloids, we ask how glial and neuronal cells interact to control neuronal death and survival. Our CRISPRi-based screens identified that GSK3β inhibits the protective NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response elicited by high neuronal activity. We then investigate the role of APOE-ε4, a risk variant for Alzheimer's disease, on neuronal survival. We find that APOE-ε4-expressing astrocytes may promote neuronal hyperactivity as compared with APOE-ε3-expressing astrocytes. This platform allows for the unbiased identification of mechanisms of neuron-glia cell interactions.",Neuron,2025
39822296,Toward alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay in clinical practice.,"INTRODUCTION: Seed amplification assays (SAAs) demonstrate remarkable diagnostic performance in alpha-synucleinopathies. However, existing protocols lack accessibility in routine laboratories, mainly due to the requirement for in-house production of recombinant alpha-synuclein (aSyn). This study proposes a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aSyn-SAA protocol using solely commercial reagents to facilitate its clinical implementation.
METHODS: Routine clinical care CSF samples from 126 patients, comprising 47 with Lewy body diseases (LBD) (41 with dementia with Lewy bodies, six with Parkinson's disease), 37 without alpha-synucleinopathy, and 42 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), underwent assessment for aSyn-SAA activity.
RESULTS: CSF aSyn-SAA showed a sensitivity of 72.3% and a specificity of 100% when distinguishing clinically diagnosed LBD patients from those without alpha-synucleinopathy. In AD patients, 14.3% were tested positive for aSyn.
DISCUSSION: The commercial-only CSF aSyn-SAA protocol exhibited excellent specificity when applied to a real-life cohort, signaling progress toward the accessibility of an aSyn biomarker in clinical settings.
HIGHLIGHTS: Diagnosis of LBD through aSyn-SAA lacks accessibility.This commercial-only aSyn-SAA has satisfactory performance in a real-life cohort.A negative aSyn-SAA does not completely exclude a synucleinopathy.Some technical points must be considered when developing aSyn-SAA.aSyn-SAA must be confined to expert laboratories due to prion-like risk management.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39886323,Age-disproportionate atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease spectra.,"INTRODUCTION: Brain age gap (BAG), defined as the difference between MRI-predicted 'brain age' and chronological age, can capture information underlying various neurological disorders. We investigated the pathophysiological significance of the BAG across neurodegenerative disorders.
METHODS: We developed a brain age estimator using structural MRIs of healthy-aged individuals from one cohort study. Subsequently, we applied this estimator to people with Alzheimer's disease spectra (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) from another cohort study. We investigated brain sources responsible for BAGs among these groups.
RESULTS: Both AD and PD exhibited a positive BAG. Brain sources showed overlapping, yet partially segregated, neuromorphological differences between these groups. Furthermore, employing with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding on the brain sources, we subclassified PD into two groups with and without cognitive impairment.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that brain age estimation becomes a clinically relevant method for finely stratifying neurodegenerative disorders.
HIGHLIGHTS: Brain age estimated from structure MRI data was greater than chronological age in patients with Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease.Brain regions attributed to brain age estimation were located mainly in the fronto-temporo-parietal cortices but not in the motor cortex or subcortical regions.Brain sources responsible for the brain age gaps revealed roughly overlapping, yet partially segregated, neuromorphological differences between participants with Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease.Participants with Parkinson's disease were subclassified into two groups (with and without cognitive impairment) based on brain sources responsible for the brain age gaps.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39748846,Stress-related coping and its relationship to well-being in nursing assistants and personal care aides in nursing homes and assisted living.,"INTRODUCTION: Professional caregivers (nursing assistants and personal care aides) in nursing homes (NH) and assisted living (AL) provide the majority of long-term residential care for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Their work is stressful, but until recently, no measures were available to assess stress in this workforce. Using the new Long-Term Care Cope (LTC COPE) scale, this study evaluates the relationship of coping with staff demographic characteristics and outcomes; the findings can be used to develop and evaluate interventions to improve staff well-being.
METHODS: We used a cross-sectional online questionnaire completed by professional caregivers working in a purposive selection of 10 NHs and three AL communities in California, New York, and North Carolina. The sample included 391 professional caregivers and had a representative distribution by age; it was 87% female; 42% non-Hispanic/Latinx (NHL) Black, 25% NHL White, 20% Hispanic/Latinx, and 7% NHL Asian. Worker job satisfaction, mental health, and health-related quality of life were examined in relation to caregiver demographics and the following approaches to coping as measured by the LTC COPE: avoidance, adaptive psychological strategies, active engagement, maladaptive psychological strategies, minimizing emotional impact, and substance use. Statistical comparisons used non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Little difference in coping strategies was noted by sex and education; older caregivers used adaptive psychological strategies more than younger caregivers; and traditionally minoritized adults (NHL Black, NHL Asian, and Hispanic/Latinx), compared to NHL White adults, more often used adaptive and less often used maladaptive psychological coping strategies. The use of maladaptive and avoidance strategies was strongly associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout.
DISCUSSION: Professional caregivers report using a wide variety of coping strategies, with multiple strategies being the norm, and both adaptive/engaged and maladaptive/disengaged approaches are common. Certain coping approaches are strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and burnout; attention to training and support of adaptive and positive coping may augment other efforts to improve job satisfaction and performance. The LTC COPE scale has the potential to guide and evaluate practices to improve workers' well-being.
HIGHLIGHTS: Professional caregivers in nursing homes and assisted living generally use multiple strategies to cope with work-related stress.Certain coping approaches are strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and burnout.The Long-Term Care Cope scale has potential to guide and evaluate practices to improve worker well-being.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2024
39932776,Alzheimer-mutant γ-secretase complexes stall amyloid β-peptide production.,"Missense mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and alter proteolytic production of secreted 38-to-43-residue amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) by the PSEN1-containing γ-secretase complex, ostensibly supporting the amyloid hypothesis of pathogenesis. However, proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase is processive, involving initial endoproteolysis to produce long Aβ peptides of 48 or 49 residues followed by carboxypeptidase trimming in mostly tripeptide increments. We recently reported evidence that FAD mutations in APP and PSEN1 cause deficiencies in early steps in processive proteolysis of APP substrate C99 and that this results from stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes. These stalled complexes triggered synaptic degeneration in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of FAD independently of Aβ production. Here, we conducted full quantitative analysis of all proteolytic events on APP substrate by γ-secretase with six additional PSEN1 FAD mutations and found that all six are deficient in multiple processing steps. However, only one of these (F386S) was deficient in certain trimming steps but not in endoproteolysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in intact cells revealed that all six PSEN1 FAD mutations lead to stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate/intermediate complexes. The F386S mutation, however, does so only in Aβ-rich regions of the cells, not in C99-rich regions, consistent with the deficiencies of this mutant enzyme only in trimming of Aβ intermediates. These findings provide further evidence that FAD mutations lead to stalled and stabilized γ-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes and are consistent with the stalled process rather than the products of γ-secretase proteolysis as the pathogenic trigger.",Elife,2025
40182760,Association between serum tricosanoic acid and cognitive function in older adults: findings from the NHANES and GEO databases.,"INTRODUCTION: With global aging, dementia prevalence rises. While long-chain saturated fatty acids show anti-cognitive decline potential, serum tricosanoic acid (C23:0)'s role in brain regions and cognition remains unclear.
METHODS: To confirm the association between C23:0 and cognition in the population, we analyzed gene expression data from the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain gene chip data set (GSE118553) available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Additionally, we examined data from 1,127 adults aged 60 years and older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2011 and 2014. To explore potential metabolic pathways and mechanisms linking C23:0 to cognitive aging, the computational platform METAFlux was employed.
RESULTS: Differential gene expression analysis identified 335 downregulated and 477 upregulated genes in AD frontal cortex. Metabolite analysis showed 20 upregulated and 37 downregulated nutrients (including C23:0) in AD vs. controls. Population-level analysis (NHANES, n = 1,127) confirmed higher serum C23:0 associated with better cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: This study provides strong evidence for frontal cortex-specific reduced C23:0 in AD and highlights its potential as a serum cognitive marker.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39699037,Exploratory study of French healthcare workers' experiences of anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Anosognosia or lack of insight is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associated disorders. It is an impairment in the ability to recognize the disease and related symptoms. Anosognosia is associated among patients with poor compensatory strategies, behavioral disorders, apathy and caregiver burden. Therefore, its early identification by healthcare workers is a major challenge in order to provide support for both patients and caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge, attitudes and experiences of French healthcare workers relating to anosognosia in AD and related disorders.
METHODS: An online self-completed questionnaire was created for the study. It was anonymous and divided into three dimensions: general knowledge, confidence, and subjective experiences of anosognosia. One hundred and eleven healthcare workers completed the questionnaire. Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to determine the variables associated with the total knowledge and confidence scores. Ordinal logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations between subjective experiences and demographics.
RESULTS: The participants had moderate knowledge. Knowledge scores were influenced by their experience in the geriatric field, type of profession, workplaces and training. The areas where knowledge was poorest were anosognosia assessment and management. The participants with the lowest knowledge levels were those interacting the most with patients, especially at home. Overall, they identified difficulties related to anosognosia and did not seem confident about their ability to deal with this condition.
CONCLUSIONS: This study determines specific areas for training on anosognosia, such as identification, assessment and management of this condition.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39818277,Phosphorylated-tau associates with HSV-1 chromatin and correlates with nuclear speckles decondensation in low-density host chromatin regions.,"Abnormal tau phosphorylation is a key mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence implicates infectious agents, such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), as co-factors in the onset or the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. This has led to divergence in the field regarding the contribution of viruses in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Research indicates that viruses may function as risk factors driving neurodegenerative disease rather than playing a causative role. Investigating HSV-1 in abnormal tau phosphorylation is important for understanding the role of infectious agents in neurodegeneration. We generated cellular models of HSV-1 acute, latent infection, and viral reactivation from latency in cortical brain organoids and investigated the interplay between tau phosphorylation and HSV-1 infection by employing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived monolayer neuronal cultures and brain organoids. Acute infection with HSV-1 strains 17syn<sup>+</sup> and KOS caused nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons and neural precursor cells. Antivirals prevented nuclear accumulation of p-tau. Viral reactivation was accompanied by the nuclear translocation of p-tau. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an interaction of p-tau with the viral chromatin. A reduction in abundance of component of nuclear speckles and their loss of organized morphology in low-denisty host chromatin regions was observed, with strain-specific differences. HSV-1 infection was followed by an increase in the abundance of BRSKs and TAOKs, kinases known to phosphorylate tau. These findings show interaction between p-tau and HSV-1 chromatin and demonstrate the ability of HSV-1 to activate mechanisms that are observed in Alzheimer's disease.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39814427,Discovering potential ERK1 inhibitors from natural products for therapeutic targeting of Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) belongs to mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are essential for memory formation, cognitive function, and synaptic plasticity. During Alzheimer's disease (AD), ERK1 phosphorylates tau at 15 phosphorylation sites, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The overactivation of ERK1 in microglia promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which results in neuroinflammation. Additionally, elevated oxidative stress during AD stimulates the ERK1 pathway, leading to neuronal loss.
OBJECTIVE: Because ERK1 signaling plays a significant role in tau phosphorylation, targeting ERK1 may be therapeutically beneficial by either preventing excessive activation of the signaling pathway or altering its pathway to enhance neuroprotective effects during AD.
METHODS: This study employed structure-based virtual screening of phytoconstituents from the IMPPAT library. Subsequently, in-depth docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were implemented to identify potential ERK1 inhibitors with desirable pharmacological properties.
RESULTS: Silandrin and Hydroxytuberosone were found to be potential ERK1 inhibitors with higher affinity and specificity than the control molecule Tizaterkib. These compounds specifically bind to the ERK1 substrate binding pocket and interact with crucial residues. Finally, the elucidated compounds with ERK1 were evaluated using an all-atom molecular MD simulation to analyze structural dynamics, structural compactness, hydrogen bond dynamics, principal component analysis, and free energy landscape.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that Silandrin and Hydroxytuberosone can further be exploited as potential lead molecules for therapeutic development against ERK1-mediated AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39935329,SSRIs reduce plasma tau and restore dorsal raphe metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Tau pathology impacts neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) being among the brain regions showing the earliest tau pathology. As a serotonergic hub, DRN activity is altered by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which also have variable effects on cognitive decline and pathology in AD.
METHODS: We examined N = 191 subjects with baseline <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and plasma biomarker data to study the effects of SSRIs on tau pathology, cognitive decline, and DRN metabolism.
RESULTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) was lower with SSRI use. The effect of SSRIs on cognition varied by cognitive assessment. The DRN was hypometabolic in AD patients relative to healthy controls; however, SSRI use restored the metabolic activity of this region in AD patients.
DISCUSSION: Long-term SSRI use may reduce the pathological presentation of AD but has variable effects on cognitive performance.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau pathology spreads throughout the brain during AD pathogenesis. The DRN is among the first regions to develop tau pathology during this process. SSRI use restores the metabolic activity of the DRN and reduces plasma p-tau181.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39780773,Impact of neighborhood disadvantage on cardiometabolic health and cognition in a community-dwelling cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood disadvantage may be an important determinant of cardiometabolic health and cognitive aging. However, less is known about relationships among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage measured by national Area Deprivation Index (ADI) rank with measures of cardiometabolic health and cognition among Wake Forest (WF) Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) participants, with and without MCI.
RESULTS: ADI was positively associated with blood pressure and cardiometabolic index (CMI), and negatively associated with global and Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC5) scores, in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. ADI was only positively associated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in MCI.
DISCUSSION: Neighborhood disadvantage is associated more strongly with measures of cardiometabolic health and cognition among CU individuals rather than MCI. These findings demonstrate a need for structural solutions to address social determinants of health in an attempt to reduce cardiometabolic and cognitive risks.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2024
39936500,Single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of the basal forebrain reveals diverse ageing-related pathways.,"The basal forebrain is a critical brain region involved in various neurobiological processes, including learning, memory, and attention. Basal forebrain cells undergo structural and functional changes during ageing, increasing their vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. To reveal the molecular landscape of distinct cell types during developmental and early ageing, we constructed a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas spanning postnatal day 4 (P4), postnatal day 14 (P14), 3 month (3M), 9 months (9M) and 15 months (15M). Distinct molecular regulatory patterns of basal forebrain subclasses and ageing-related pathways were unveiled. The transcriptional regulation analysis and pseudo-time analysis revealed the dynamic regulatory network of cholinergic neurons during postnatal development. To gain insights into the relationship between ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted an integrative analysis. We identified four potential regulatory networks involved in cholesterol/lipid metabolism, DNA damage repair, and death receptor signal in 5×FAD mice. The cholinergic subtype CN-2 exhibited heightened activity of regulons associated with Srebf2 and Zmiz1, which, in turn, target hub genes implicated in these networks. Meanwhile, CN-2 is the main cholinergic subtype contributing to the alteration of the NRXN signalling pathway. This study offers a significant data source to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of ageing-related and pathological changes in the basal forebrain, paving the way for future research and therapeutic interventions that target specific basal forebrain subclasses and signalling pathways.",Brain,2025

40013092,"Quantification and correlation of amyloid-β plaque load, glial activation, GABAergic interneuron numbers, and cognitive decline in the young TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are essential tools for investigating disease pathophysiology and conducting preclinical drug testing. In this study, we examined neuronal and glial alterations in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of young TgF344-AD rats and correlated these changes with cognitive decline and amyloid-β plaque load.
METHODS: We compared TgF344-AD and non-transgenic littermate rats aged 7-8 months of age. We systematically quantified β-amyloid plaques, astrocytes, microglia, four different subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (calretinin-, cholecystokinin-, parvalbumin-, and somatostatin-positive neurons), and newly generated neurons in the hippocampus. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Barnes maze test.
RESULTS: Young TgF344-AD rats had a large number of amyloid plaques in both the hippocampus and mPFC, together with a pronounced increase in microglial cell numbers. Astrocytic activation was significant in the mPFC. Cholecystokinin-positive cell numbers were decreased in the hippocampus of transgenic rats, but calretinin-, parvalbumin-, and somatostatin-positive cell numbers were not altered. Adult neurogenesis was not affected by genotype. TgF344-AD rats had spatial learning and memory impairments, but this cognitive deficit did not correlate with amyloid plaque number or cellular changes in the brain. In the hippocampus, amyloid plaque numbers were negatively correlated with cholecystokinin-positive neuron and microglial cell numbers. In the mPFC, amyloid plaque number was negatively correlated with the number of astrocytes.
CONCLUSION: Pronounced neuropathological changes were found in the hippocampus and mPFC of young TgF344-AD rats, including the loss of hippocampal cholecystokinin-positive interneurons. Some of these neuropathological changes were negatively correlated with amyloid-β plaque load, but not with cognitive impairment.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39822289,Amyloid-related changes in fluency in patients with subjective cognitive decline.,"INTRODUCTION: We examined semantic and phonemic fluency in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in relation to amyloid status and clinical progression.
METHODS: A total of 490 individuals with SCD (62 ± 8 years, 42% female, 28% amyloid-positive, 17% clinical progression) completed annual fluency assessments (mean ± SD follow-up 4.3 ± 2.9 years). Associations between fluency trajectories, amyloid status, and clinical progression were examined with linear mixed models and joint models.
RESULTS: Amyloid-positive individuals declined faster than amyloid-negative individuals on semantic fluency (B = -0.35, p &lt; 0.001), but not on phonemic fluency (B = -0.06, p = 0.218). An annual decline of one word in semantic and phonemic fluency was associated with 22% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22, p &lt; 0.001) and 28% (HR = 1.28, p = 0.004) increased risk of clinical progression.
DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that decline in semantic fluency is an early indicator of cognitive deficits in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: Abnormal amyloid burden is associated with decline in semantic fluency.Fluency trajectories are associated with an increased risk of clinical progression.More refined measures are needed to detect the earliest language deficits.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
39994231,Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer's disease.,"Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience. We propose a systemic ""bioenergetic capacity"", the individual ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions. Using fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker presentations of AD. Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. The estimated treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD. Furthermore, monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be achieved using existing clinical assays.",Nat Commun,2025
39995873,Imaging lipid rafts reveals the principle of ApoE4-induced Aβ upregulation in human neurons.,"Lipid rafts in plasma membranes are thought to provide a platform for regulating signaling pathways by increasing the expression or proximity of proteins in the same pathway. Despite this understanding, the absence of direct, simultaneous observations of lipid rafts and their affiliated proteins has hindered a comprehensive assessment of their roles across various biological contexts. Amyloid-β (Aβ), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is generated from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) by β- and γ-secretases, primarily within endosomes after APP endocytosis by canonical clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neurons. In this study, we developed a protocol for imaging APP on lipid rafts using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and found that astrocyte ApoE4 contributes to an increase in APP localization on lipid rafts, subsequently elevating Aβ<sub>42</sub> synthesis in a clathrin-independent manner in neurons.",iScience,2025
40110639,Distinct medical and substance use histories associate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Phenotype clustering reduces patient heterogeneity and could be useful when designing precision clinical trials. We hypothesized that the onset of early cognitive decline in patients would exhibit variance predicated on the clinical history documented prior to an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.
METHODS: Self-reported medical and substance use history (i.e., problem history) was used to cluster participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) into distinct subtypes. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to determine the effect of problem history subtype on cognitive decline over 2 years.
RESULTS: Two thousand seven hundred fifty-four individuals were partitioned into three subtypes: minimal (n = 1380), substance use (n = 1038), and cardiovascular (n = 336). The cardiovascular problem history subtype had significantly worse cognitive decline over a 2 year follow-up period (p = 0.013).
DISCUSSION: Our study highlights the need to account for problem history to reduce heterogeneity of outcomes in AD clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Clinical data were used to identify subtypes of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. Three problem history subtypes were found: minimal, substance use, and cardiovascular. The mean change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was assessed over a 2 year follow-up. The cardiovascular subtype was associated with the worst cognitive decline. The magnitude of change in CDR-SB was similar to recent AD clinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39716786,Acetyl-L-Carnitine Aids in Preservation of Cholinergic Neurons and Memory in the Drosophila melanogaster Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The lack of effective therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease demands both the search for new drugs and the reconsideration of already known substances currently used in other areas of medicine. Drosophila melanogaster offers the potential to model features of Alzheimer's disease, study disease mechanisms, and conduct drug screening.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the neuroprotective properties of the drug ""carnicetine"", which is an acetylated form of the natural low molecular weight compound L-carnitine. The drug is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is currently used as a means of improving cellular metabolism.
METHODS: Using tissue-specific drivers, direct expression of amyloid beta peptide (42 amino acids) was exhibited in certain groups of neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster brain, namely in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (carnicetine) on the death of these neurons and the memory of flies was analyzed.
RESULTS: The expression of amyloid beta peptide in dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons resulted in neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the Drosophila brain and memory impairment. The use of carnicetine added to animal food made it possible to treat these disorders. At the same time, no effect on dopaminergic neurons was noted.
CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirmed the neuroprotective properties of the drug under study, demonstrating its participation in the restoration of the cholinergic system and the feasibility of using carnicetine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Curr Alzheimer Res,2024
39887500,Biomarker treatment effects in two phase 3 trials of gantenerumab.,"INTRODUCTION: We report biomarker treatment effects in the GRADUATE I and II phase 3 studies of gantenerumab in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET), volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma biomarkers used to assess gantenerumab treatment related changes on neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation over 116 weeks.
RESULTS: Gantenerumab reduced amyloid PET load, CSF biomarkers of amyloid beta (Aβ)40, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), neurogranin, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), neurofilament light (NfL), alpha-synuclein (α-syn), neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), and plasma biomarkers of t-tau, p-tau181, p-tau217, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) while increasing plasma Aβ40, Aβ42. vMRI showed increased reduction in whole brain volume and increased ventricular expansion, while hippocampal volume was unaffected. Tau PET showed no treatment effect.
DISCUSSION: Robust treatment effects were observed for multiple biomarkers in GRADUATE I and II. Comparison across anti-amyloid antibodies indicates utility of p-tau and GFAP as biomarkers of amyloid plaque removal while NfL and tau PET seem unsuitable as consistent indicators of clinical efficacy. vMRI might be confounded by non-neurodegenerative brain volume changes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER): NCT03444870 and NCT03443973.
HIGHLIGHTS: Gantenerumab significantly reduced brain amyloid load. Tau positron emission tomography showed no treatment effect in a small subset of participants. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging showed increased whole brain volume reduction under treatment while hippocampal volume was unaffected. Robust treatment effects on cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers were found, despite lack of clinical efficacy.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39827356,Targeting early tau pathology: probiotic diet enhances cognitive function and reduces inflammation in a preclinical Alzheimer's model.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incurable, yet its long prodromal phase offers a crucial window for early intervention. Pretangle tau, a precursor to neurofibrillary tangles, plays a key role in early AD pathogenesis. Intervening in pretangle tau pathology could significantly delay the progression of AD. The gut-brain axis, increasingly recognized as a contributor to AD, represents a promising therapeutic target due to its role in regulating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. While probiotics have shown cognitive benefits in amyloid-centered AD models, their effect on pretangle tau pathology remains elusive.
METHODS: This study evaluates the effects of probiotics in a rat model of preclinical AD, specifically targeting hyperphosphorylated pretangle tau in the locus coeruleus. TH-CRE rats (N = 47; 24 females and 23 males) received either AAV carrying pseudophosphorylated human tau (htauE14) or a control virus at 3 months of age. Probiotic or control diets were administered at 9-12 months, with blood and fecal samples collected for ELISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Behavioral assessments were conducted at 13-14 months, followed by analysis of brain inflammation, blood-brain barrier integrity, and GSK-3β activation.
RESULTS: Rats expressing pseudophosphorylated tau displayed impairment in spatial Y-maze (F<sub>1,39</sub> = 4.228, p = 0.046), spontaneous object location (F<sub>1,39</sub> = 6.240, p = 0.017), and olfactory discrimination (F<sub>1,39</sub> = 7.521, p = 0.009) tests. Phosphorylation of tau at S262 (t<sub>3</sub> = -4.834) and S356 (t<sub>3</sub> = -3.258) in the locus coeruleus was parallelled by GSK-3β activation in the hippocampus (F<sub>1,24</sub> = 10.530, p = 0.003). Probiotic supplementation increased gut microbiome diversity (F<sub>1,31</sub> = 8.065, p = 0.007) and improved bacterial composition (F<sub>1,31</sub> = 3.4867, p = 0.001). The enhancement in gut microbiomes was associated with enhanced spatial learning (p &lt; 0.05), reduced inflammation indexed by Iba-1 (F<sub>1,25</sub> = 5.284, p = 0.030) and CD-68 (F<sub>1,26</sub> = 8.441, p = 0.007) expression, and inhibited GSK-3β in female rats (p &lt; 0.01 compared to control females).
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of probiotics to modulate the gut-brain axis and mitigate pretangle tau-related pathology in preclinical AD. Probiotic supplementation could offer a novel early intervention strategy for AD, highlighting the pivotal role of gut health in neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39966624,"Circular RNAs in neurological conditions - computational identification, functional validation, and potential clinical applications.","Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to advancements in biotechnology, particularly high-throughput total RNA sequencing. These developments have led to new understandings of non-coding biology, revealing that approximately 80% of non-coding regions in the genome possesses biochemical functionality. Among ncRNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs), first identified in 1976, have emerged as a prominent research field. CircRNAs are abundant in most human cell types, evolutionary conserved, highly stable, and formed by back-splicing events which generate covalently closed ends. Notably, circRNAs exhibit high expression levels in neural tissue and perform diverse biochemical functions, including acting as molecular sponges for microRNAs, interacting with RNA-binding proteins to regulate their availability and activity, modulating transcription and splicing, and even translating into functional peptides in some cases. Recent advancements in computational and experimental methods have enhanced our ability to identify and validate circRNAs, providing valuable insights into their biological roles. This review focuses on recent developments in circRNA research as they related to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. We also explore their potential applications in clinical diagnostics, therapeutics, and future research directions. CircRNAs remain a relatively underexplored area of non-coding biology, particularly in the context of neurological disorders. However, emerging evidence supports their role as critical players in the etiology and molecular mechanisms of conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that circRNAs may provide a novel framework contributing to the molecular dysfunctions underpinning these complex neurological conditions.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40026419,Stools from a human APOEe2 donor reduces amyloid and tau pathology and increases neuroinflammation in a 3xTg AD mouse model.,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of the e2 variant of the APOE gene (APOEe2) against Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been elucidated. We altered the microbiota of 3xTgAD mice by fecal microbiota transplantation from a human APOEe2 donor (e2-FMT) and tested the effect of microbiota perturbations on brain AD pathology.
METHODS: FMT of bacteria isolated from stools of untreated 3xTgAD mice (M-FMT) or e2-FMT were transplanted in 15-month-old 3xTgAD mice. FMT was done alone or in combination with antibiotic and proton-pump inhibitor following the Microbiota Transfer Therapy protocol (MTT). The effect of donor (M or e2) and transplantation protocol (FMT or MTT) on hippocampal amyloid, tau pathology and neuroinflammation were assessed at the end of the treatment.
RESULTS: e2-FMT reduced amyloid, and tau pathology as well as increased neuroinflammation as compared with M-FMT. MTT was associated with reduced number of Aβ40+ plaques and tau pathology. Low levels of amyloid were associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in e2-FMT mice. These associations were partially attenuated by MTT.
CONCLUSION: Bacteria from a human APOEe2 donor reduced AD pathology and increased neuroinflammation in mice suggesting that the gut microbiota may be a mediator of the protective effect of APOEe2.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
40111921,Brain and blood transcriptome-wide association studies identify five novel genes associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their functional implications remain unclear. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) offer enhanced statistical power by analyzing genetic associations at the gene level rather than at the variant level, enabling assessment of how genetically-regulated gene expression influences AD risk. However, previous AD-TWAS have been limited by small expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reference datasets or reliance on AD-by-proxy phenotypes.ObjectiveTo perform the most powerful AD-TWAS to date using summary statistics from the largest available brain and blood cis-eQTL meta-analyses applied to the largest clinically-adjudicated AD GWAS.MethodsWe implemented the OTTERS TWAS pipeline to predict gene expression using the largest available cis-eQTL data from cortical brain tissue (MetaBrain; N = 2683) and blood (eQTLGen; N = 31,684), and then applied these models to AD-GWAS data (Cases = 21,982; Controls = 44,944).ResultsWe identified and validated five novel gene associations in cortical brain tissue (PRKAG1, C3orf62, LYSMD4, ZNF439, SLC11A2) and six genes proximal to known AD-related GWAS loci (Blood: MYBPC3; Brain: MTCH2, CYB561, MADD, PSMA5, ANXA11). Further, using causal eQTL fine-mapping, we generated sparse models that retained the strength of the AD-TWAS association for MTCH2, MADD, ZNF439, CYB561, and MYBPC3.ConclusionsOur comprehensive AD-TWAS discovered new gene associations and provided insights into the functional relevance of previously associated variants, which enables us to further understand the genetic architecture underlying AD risk.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025

Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can cross the blood-brain barrier carrying neuron-specific molecules, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which have potential as biomarkers of neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We explored the association between neuronal-derived EV miRNAs from serum and AD clinical status by performing a transcriptome-wide association study involving 46 participants with clinical AD, 14 participants with preclinical AD, and 60 neurologically healthy controls.
RESULTS: We identified 14 miRNAs associated with AD risk, with more pronounced transcriptional alterations in preclinical individuals compared to clinical AD individuals. Functional analysis revealed enrichment of miRNA-target genes in neurodegenerative pathways, highlighting synuclein alpha (SNCA), cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS), and microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) as key targets.
DISCUSSION: Our results highlight the potential role of neuronal-derived EVs in neurodegeneration and suggest avenues for further research into brain-derived biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) carry potential brain biomarkers. We tested the association between NDEV microRNAs (miRNAs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fourteen NDEV miRNAs were associated with AD. Preclinical AD displayed more pronounced transcriptional changes than clinical AD. miRNA-target genes were enriched in pathways associated with neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39702440,Intracerebral hemorrhage following mild ARIA-H in an APOE ε2 carrier receiving lecanemab.,"OBJECTIVE: Report a case of an apolipoprotein E (APOE)ε2 carrier receiving lecanemab who developed late onset intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) following amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-hemorrhage (ARIA-H).
METHOD: We detail the history and neuroimaging findings of a 73-year-old male with Alzheimer's disease (APOEε2/ε3 status) who developed ICH after mild ARIA-H and suffering a fall.
RESULTS: The patient developed mild ARIA-H after his 13th infusion that was proceeded by left temporo-occipital hemorrhage following his 14th infusion.
DISCUSSION: Although APOE ε2 is known to be protective against Alzheimer's disease, it has also been shown to increase risk for hemorrhage with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This case serves as an opportunity to examine the complex role that APOE ε2 plays in both protection against Alzheimer's disease and contribution to increased hemorrhagic risk with lecanemab.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2024
39920821,β-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid as a potential biomarker for distinguishing human prion diseases from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"BACKGROUND: β-synuclein (β-syn), mainly expressed in central nerve system, is one of the biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood for synaptic damage, which has been reported to be elevated in CSF and blood of the patients of prion diseases (PrDs).
METHODS: We analyzed 314 CSF samples from patients in China National Surveillance for CJD. The diagnostic groups of the 223 patients with PrDs included sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (sCJD), genetic CJD (gCJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS). 91 patients with non-PrDs comprised Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), viral encephalitis (VE) or autoimmune encephalitis (AE) were enrolled in the control groups. The CSF β-syn levels were measured by a commercial microfluidic ELISA. The Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were employed to analyze two or more sets of continuous variables. Multiple linear regression was also performed to evaluate the factors for CSF β-syn levels. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were used to assess the diagnostic performance of β-syn.
RESULTS: The median of β-syn levels (2074 pg/ml; IQR: 691 to 4332) of all PrDs was significantly higher than that of non-PrDs group (504 pg/ml; IQR: 126 to 3374). The CSF β-syn values in the cohorts of sCJD, T188K-gCJD, E200K-gCJD and P102L-GSS were remarkably higher than that of the group of AD + PD, but similar as that of the group of VE + AE. The elevated CSF β-syn in sCJD and gCJD cases was statistically associated with CSF 14-3-3 positive and appearance of mutism. ROC curve analysis identified satisfied performance for distinguishing from AD + PD, with high AUC values in sCJD (0.7640), T188K-gCJD (0.8489), E200K-gCJD (0.8548), P102L-GSS (0.7689) and D178N-FFI (0.7210), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our data here indicate that CSF β-syn is a potential biomarker for distinguishing PrDs (gCJD, sCJD and GSS) from AD and PD, but is much less efficient from VE and AE. These findings have critical implications for early diagnosis and monitoring of synaptic integrity in prion diseases.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39747269,Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study on cerebrovascular reactivity changes in the precuneus of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline, ultimately culminating in dementia. This study aims to evaluate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and functional connectivity (FC) in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), bypassing the requirement for hypercapnia. The study cohort comprised 53 AD patients, 38 MCI patients, and 39 normal control (NC) subjects. CVR is derived by extracting signals within specific frequency bands of rs-fMRI. This study compares the differences in CVR and FC among the three groups, using the brain regions with CVR differences as region of interest (ROI) for FC analysis. The correlation between CVR and FC and cognitive scale score was discussed. Compared with NC subjects, AD patients exhibited a decrease in CVR in the PCUN.L, whereas MCI patients showed an increase in CVR in the PCUN.R. With PCUN.L as ROI, FC in PCUN.R decreased in AD patients, and FC in SFGmed.R and other brain regions increased in MCI patients compared with NC subjects. The results of the correlation analysis indicate that CVR in all patients, as well as FC with the PCUN.L as the ROI to the PCUN.R and SFGmed.R, show positive correlations with MMSE and MoCA scores. These results suggest that there are significant differences between CVR and FC with CVR differential brain regions as ROI among the AD, MCI, and NC groups, which may help to explain the hemodynamic mechanism. CVR obtained with rs-fMRI may be a potential biomarker for assessing cognitive impairment.",Sci Rep,2025
39934345,Serum biomarkers associated with health impacts of high residential radon exposure: a metabolomic pilot study.,"Long-term epidemiological evidence suggests that populations exposed to high natural radiation levels for extended periods may have an increased risk of cancer and other diseases. However, research on health effects in high-radon areas, particularly regarding disease-related biomarkers, remains limited. This study aimed to investigate serum metabolic biomarkers associated with diseases in individuals from areas with high radon exposure. Metabolic profiling was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry on 30 healthy participants comprising 15 individuals from a low-residential radon exposure group and 15 from a high-residential radon exposure group. Multivariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) between the two groups, identifying 92 metabolites. ROC analysis (AUC ≥ 0.85) highlighted 12 key candidates associated with high radon exposure. KEGG pathway analysis linked D-sphingosine to lung cancer development and 3-methylhistidine to kidney disease, early preeclampsia, and Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that D-sphingosine and 3-methylhistidine are promising serum biomarkers for identifying high-risk individuals with prolonged radon exposure and contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers in future studies on high-radon exposure areas.",Sci Rep,2025
39985073,Peripheral and central neuroimmune mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a growing global health challenge as populations age. Recent research highlights the crucial role of peripheral immunity in AD pathogenesis. This review explores how blood-brain barrier disruption allows peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), worsening neuroinflammation and disease progression. We examine recent findings on interactions between peripheral immune cells and CNS-resident microglia, forming a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle leading to neuronal dysfunction. Moreover, this review emphasizes recent developments in the dysregulation of immune factors from both the periphery and CNS, and their impact on AD progression. With ongoing research and development of new therapeutic strategies, this review underscores the importance of modulating interactions between the peripheral immune system and CNS in AD therapy.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
40149580,"Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: Clinical Presentation, Sequelae and Neuroimaging Features-An Update.","The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been shown to increase with age, with rates reported to be around 50-60% in individuals over 80 years old who have cognitive impairment. The disease often presents as spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which carries a high risk of recurrence, along with transient focal neurologic episodes (TFNE) and progressive cognitive decline, potentially leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to ICH, neuroradiologic findings of CAA include cortical and subcortical microbleeds (MB), cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS). Non-hemorrhagic pathologies include dilated perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale and multiple hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A definitive diagnosis of CAA still requires histological confirmation. The Boston criteria allow for the diagnosis of a probable or possible CAA by considering specific neurological and MRI findings. The recent version, 2.0, which includes additional non-hemorrhagic MRI findings, increases sensitivity while maintaining the same specificity. The characteristic MRI findings of autoantibody-related CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri) are similar to the so-called ""amyloid related imaging abnormalities"" (ARIA) observed with amyloid antibody therapies, presenting in two variants: (a) vasogenic edema and leptomeningeal effusions (ARIA-E) and (b) hemorrhagic lesions (ARIA-H). Clinical and MRI findings enable the diagnosis of a probable or possible CAA-ri, with biopsy remaining the gold standard for confirmation. In contrast to spontaneous CAA-ri, only about 20% of patients treated with monoclonal antibodies who show proven ARIA on MRI also experience clinical symptoms, including headache, confusion, other psychopathological abnormalities, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting. Recent findings indicate that treatment should be continued in cases of mild ARIA, with ongoing MRI and clinical monitoring. This review offers a concise update on CAA and its associated consequences.",Biomedicines,2025
40108988,Relationships between hypometabolism and both β-amyloid and tau PET in corticobasal syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology causes corticobasal syndrome (CBS) in 21%-50% of patients. Studies have assessed hypometabolism in CBS according to β-amyloid (A) positron emission tomography (PET), but the understanding of the association of both AD-tau (T) and A with hypometabolism is incomplete.
METHODS: Thirty-three CBS patients and 45 controls underwent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), flortaucipir, and Pittsburgh compound-B PET and were classified as A± and T±. FDG-PET uptake was extracted for 12 regions-of-interest in dominant (most affected) and non-dominant hemispheres and compared across A/T groups.
RESULTS: A+T+ patients had greater hypometabolism in temporo-parieto-occipital cortices than A+T- and A-T- groups, with no differences observed between the A+T- and A-T- groups. FDG asymmetry was more accentuated in A+T+ patients. Medial temporal and basal ganglia metabolism were similar across AT groups.
DISCUSSION: Amyloid and tau positivity contribute synergistically to hypometabolism and asymmetry in temporo-parieto-occipital cortices in CBS, with AD-like patterns of hypometabolism observed only in A+T+ patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid (A) and tau PET (T) status can be used to stratify CBS patients. A+T+ CBS patients show more hypometabolism in temporo-parieto-occipital cortices. Medial temporal metabolism (typical AD pattern) is similar across AT groups. Parieto-occipital cortices should be assessed when investigating AT pathology in CBS. Amyloid and tau positivity contribute synergistically to hypometabolism and asymmetry in CBS.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39972340,The impact of kidney function on Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers: implications for predicting amyloid-β positivity.,"BACKGROUND: Impaired kidney function has a potential confounding effect on blood biomarker levels, including biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the imminent use of certain blood biomarkers in the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected AD, knowledge on the potential impact of comorbidities on the utility of blood biomarkers is important. We aimed to evaluate the association between kidney function, assessed through estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from plasma creatinine and AD blood biomarkers, as well as their influence over predicting Aβ-positivity.
METHODS: We included 242 participants from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort, comprising cognitively unimpaired individuals (CU; n = 124), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 58), AD dementia (n = 34), and non-AD dementia (n = 26) patients all characterized by [<sup>18</sup>F] AZD-4694. Plasma samples were analyzed for Aβ42, Aβ40, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), 217 (p-tau217), 231 (p-tau231) and N-terminal containing tau fragments (NTA-tau) using Simoa technology. Kidney function was assessed by eGFR in mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, based on plasma creatinine levels, age, and sex. Participants were also stratified according to their eGFR-indexed stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We evaluated the association between eGFR and blood biomarker levels with linear models and assessed whether eGFR provided added predictive value to determine Aβ-positivity with logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Biomarker concentrations were highest in individuals with CKD stage 3, followed by stages 2 and 1, but differences were only significant for NfL, Aβ42, and Aβ40 (not Aβ42/Aβ40). All investigated biomarkers showed significant associations with eGFR except plasma NTA-tau, with stronger relationships observed for Aβ40 and NfL. However, after adjusting for either age, sex or Aβ-PET SUVr, the association with eGFR was no longer significant for all biomarkers except Aβ40, Aβ42, NfL, and GFAP. When evaluating whether accounting for kidney function could lead to improved prediction of Aβ-positivity, we observed no improvements in model fit (Akaike Information Criterion, AIC) or in discriminative performance (AUC) by adding eGFR to a base model including each plasma biomarker, age, and sex. While covariates like age and sex improved model fit, eGFR contributed minimally, and there were no significant differences in clinical discrimination based on AUC values.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that kidney function seems to be associated with AD blood biomarker concentrations. However, these associations did not remain significant after adjusting for age and sex, except for Aβ40, Aβ42, NfL, and GFAP. While covariates such as age and sex improved prediction of Aβ-positivity, including eGFR in the models did not lead to improved prediction for any biomarker. Our findings indicate that renal function, within the normal to mild impairment range, does not seem to have a clinically relevant impact when using highly accurate blood biomarkers, such as p-tau217, in a biomarker-supported diagnosis.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39962212,Multimodal surface-based transformer model for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Current deep learning methods for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) typically rely on analyzing all or parts of high-resolution 3D volumetric features, which demand expensive computational resources and powerful GPUs, particularly when using multimodal data. In contrast, lightweight cortical surface representations offer a more efficient approach for quantifying AD-related changes across different cortical regions, such as alterations in cortical structures, impaired glucose metabolism, and the deposition of pathological biomarkers like amyloid-β and tau. Despite these advantages, few studies have focused on diagnosing AD using multimodal surface-based data. This study pioneers a novel method that leverages multimodal, lightweight cortical surface features extracted from MRI and PET scans, providing an alternative to computationally intensive 3D volumetric features. Our model employs a middle-fusion approach with a cross-attention mechanism to efficiently integrate features from different modalities. Experimental evaluations on the ADNI series dataset, using T1-weighted MRI and [Formula: see text]Fluorodeoxyglucose PET, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms volume-based methods in both early AD diagnosis accuracy and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of our model is further validated with the combination of T1-weighted MRI, Aβ PET, and Tau PET scans, yielding favorable results. Our findings highlight the potential of surface-based transformer models as a superior alternative to conventional volume-based approaches.",Sci Rep,2025
40102403,Correlations of blood and brain NMR metabolomics with Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, impacting millions of geriatric patients globally. Unfortunately, AD can only be diagnosed post-mortem, through the analysis of autopsied brain tissue in human patients. This renders early detection and countering disease progression difficult. As AD progresses, the metabolomic profile of the brain and other organs can change. These alterations can be detected in peripheral systems (i.e., blood) such that biomarkers of the disease can be identified and monitored with minimal invasion. In this work, High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HRMAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to correlate biochemical changes in mouse brain tissues, from the cortex and hippocampus, with blood plasma. Ten micrograms of each brain tissue and ten microliters of blood plasma were obtained from 5XFAD Tg AD mice models (n = 15, 8 female, 7 male) and female C57/BL6 wild-type mice (n = 8). Spectral regions-of-interest (ROI, n = 51) were identified, and 121 potential metabolites were assigned using the Human Metabolome Database and tabulated according to their trends (increase/decrease, false discovery rate significance). This work identified several metabolites that impact glucose oxidation (lactic acid, pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate), allude to oxidative stress resulting in brain dysfunction (L-cysteine, galactitol, propionic acid), as well as those interacting with other neural pathways (taurine, dimethylamine). This work also suggests correlated metabolomic changes within blood plasma, proposing an avenue for biomarker detection, ideally leading to improved patient diagnosis and prognosis in the future.",Transl Psychiatry,2025
40009384,Ultrasound Neuromodulation With Transcranial Pulse Stimulation in Alzheimer Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Given the increasing prevalence of dementia and the limited treatment options available, ultrasound neuromodulation could serve as a novel add-on therapy to standard treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD). As ultrasound neuromodulation is still in its early stages, further research is essential to fully explore its potential in treating brain disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and functional imaging effects of transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) in patients with AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted at the Medical University of Vienna between January 1, 2017, and July 27, 2022. Sixty patients with clinically diagnosed AD receiving state-of-the-art treatment were randomly allocated to treatment sequence groups verum-sham (first cycle verum, second cycle sham, n = 30) and sham-verum (n = 30). Data analysis was performed from July 28, 2022, to September 5, 2024.
INTERVENTION: Each participant received 6 verum and 6 sham TPS sessions (6000 pulses, 0.20 mJ/mm2, 5 Hz) to frontoparietal brain areas.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Neuropsychological tests, including the primary outcome Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) corrected total score (CTS), were performed at baseline and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following the stimulations in each cycle. Primary and secondary outcomes, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and Beck Depression Inventory-II, were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis and, for sensitivity, by per protocol analysis.
RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat analysis, 60 patients between ages 51 and 82 years (mean [SD], 70.65 [8.16] years; 30 females; 30 males) were included. The CERAD CTS increased by a mean (SD) of 2.22 (6.87) points in the verum condition from 70.93 (14.27) points at baseline to 73.15 (14.90) 3 months after stimulation, while the mean (SD) score in the sham condition increased by 1.00 (6.82) point vs baseline from 71.68 (13.62] at baseline to 72.68 (14.48) 3 months after stimulation. Primary data analysis of the condition × session interaction was not significant (P = .68; partial η2 [ηp2] = 0.01), but its interaction with age was P = .003; ηp2 = 0.08, followed by post hoc analyses of age subsamples. Although several patients older than 70 years benefited from verum TPS, only the younger subgroup (≤70 years) showed significantly higher CTS increases for verum in all poststimulation sessions (condition × session: P = .005; ηp2 = 0.16). At 3 months after stimulation, for example, a mean (SD) 3.91 (7.86)-point increase was found for verum TPS in the younger patients, but a mean (SD) CTS decrease of 1.83 (5.80) was observed for sham. Memory-associated brain activation was significantly higher after verum TPS in the precuneus, visual, and frontal areas, while resting state functional connectivity was significantly upregulated in the dorsal attention network. In the per protocol sample, a significant reduction of the Beck Depression Inventory-II scores 3 months following verum TPS was found (verum baseline: 7.27 [5.87]; verum 3 months after stimulation: 5.27 [5.27]; sham baseline: 6.70 [5.65]; sham 3 months after stimulation: 6.22 [4.40]; P = .008; ηp2 = 0.23). During both verum and sham conditions, the most common observed adverse symptom was depression; no major neuropathologic change was detected in the patients by detailed neuroradiologic assessments.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of TPS in patients with AD, a 2-week verum treatment improved cognitive scores in the younger subgroup, ameliorated depressive symptoms, and induced upregulation of functional brain activation and connectivity. These findings suggest TPS may be a safe and promising add-on therapy for patients with AD receiving state-of-the-art treatment.

40149482,Curious Dichotomies of Apolipoprotein E Function in Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer-One Explanatory Mechanism of Inverse Disease Associations?,"An apparent ""inverse"" relationship exists between two seemingly unconnected conditions, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer, despite sharing similar risk factors, like increased age and obesity. AD is associated with amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles that cause neural degeneration; cancer, in contrast, is characterized by enhanced cell survival and proliferation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the main lipoprotein found in the central nervous system and via its high affinity with lipoprotein receptors plays a critical role in cholesterol transport and uptake. ApoE has 3 protein isoforms, ApoE E2, ApoE E3, and ApoE E4, respectively encoded for by 3 allelic variants of APOE (ε2, ε3, and ε4). This review examines the characteristics and function of ApoE described in both AD and cancer to assimilate evidence for its potential contribution to mechanisms that may underly the reported inverse association between the two conditions. Of the genetic risk factors relevant to most cases of AD, the most well-known with the strongest contribution to risk is APOE, specifically the ε4 variant, whereas for cancer risk, APOE has not featured as a significant genetic contributor to risk. However, at the protein level in both conditions, ApoE contributes to disease pathology via affecting lipid physiology and transport. In AD, Aβ-dependent and -independent interactions have been suggested, whereas in cancer, ApoE plays a role in immunoregulation. Understanding the mechanism of action of ApoE in these diametrically opposed diseases may enable differential targeting of therapeutics to provide a beneficial outcome for both.",Genes (Basel),2025
40110699,Association of neighborhood disadvantage with cognitive function and cortical disorganization in an unimpaired cohort: An exploratory study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood disadvantage has been shown to impact health and cognitive outcomes, while morphological similarity network (MSN) can elucidate structural morphological patterns underlying cognitive functions. We hypothesized MSNs could provide cortical patterns linked with neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive function, explaining the potential risk of cognitive impairment in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
METHODS: For cognitively unimpaired participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (n = 524), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n = 100), neighborhood disadvantage was obtained using Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and its association with cognitive performance and MSN features was analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis.
RESULTS: Neighborhood disadvantage was associated with worse cognitive performance on memory, executive function, processing speed, and preclinical Alzheimer's tests on both datasets. Local morphological organization of predominantly the frontal and temporal regions showed association trends with ADI.
DISCUSSION: Morphological patterns associated with ADI, in-part, may explain the risk for poor cognitive functioning in a neighborhood disadvantaged population.
HIGHLIGHTS: Social determinants of health such as neighborhood context can be studied using ADI. High neighborhood disadvantage was related to worse performance on category fluency, implicit learning speed, story recall memory and pre-clinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite. In this exploratory study, using morphological brain networks that indicate similarity in distribution of cortical thickness between regions, we observed that centrality of predominantly frontal and temporal regions was marginally linked with neighborhood disadvantage status and also partially mediated its association with preclinical Alzheimer's composite test. There is a potential role for considering neighborhood status in early screening of cognitive impairment and dementia.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39845447,Decreased prefrontal activation during verbal fluency task after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for depression in Alzheimer's disease: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the clinical effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The measurement of brain activation links neurobiological and functional aspects but is challenging in patients with dementia. This study investigated the influence of rTMS on cortical activation in patients with AD and depressive symptoms, measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a verbal fluency task.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, patients with AD and depression received either active rTMS (n = 17) or sham-rTMS (n = 16). Patients received 4 weeks of bilateral standard rTMS (1 Hz rTMS delivered to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and 10-Hz rTMS delivered to the left DLPFC).
RESULTS: No significant changes were found in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI); however, significant changes were found for the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the depression score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-depression; p &lt; 0.05). The results showed a decrease in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, as measured with fNIRS, from baseline to week 4 in CH41 (in right DLPFC; p = 0.0047, FDR-corrected). There was a negative correlation between the improvement in HAMD-17 severity in these patients and reduced oxygenated hemodynamic response of CH41 (r = - 0.504, p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated a positive effect of rTMS on depression in patients with AD. The underlying cortical changes were imaged using fNIRS. Prefrontal activation measured by fNIRS is a potential biomarker for monitoring the response of patients with depression in AD to rTMS treatment.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024

39713882,Integrating rare pathogenic variant prioritization with gene-based association analysis to identify novel genes and relevant multimodal traits for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence has highlighted rare variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, insufficient sample sizes, especially in underrepresented ethnic groups, hinder their investigation. Additionally, their impact on endophenotypes remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: We prioritized rare likely-deleterious variants based on whole-genome sequencing data from a Chinese AD cohort (n = 988). Gene-based optimal sequence kernel association tests were conducted between AD cases and normal controls to identify AD-related genes. Network clustering, endophenotype association, and cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate their functional consequences.
RESULTS: We identified 11 novel AD candidate genes, which captured AD-related pathways and enhanced AD risk prediction performance. Key genes (RABEP1, VIPR1, RPL3L, and CABIN1) were linked to cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Experiments showed RABEP1 p.R845W inducing endocytosis dysregulation and exacerbating toxic amyloid β accumulation, underscoring its therapeutic potential.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the contributions of rare variants to AD and provided novel insights into AD therapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: Identified 11 novel AD candidate genes in a Chinese AD cohort. Correlated candidate genes with AD-related cognitive and brain imaging traits. Indicated RABEP1 p.R845W as a critical AD contributor in the endocytic pathway.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39963471,Ketamine does not rescue plaque load or gap detection in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Ketamine has received growing attention for its effects on neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation, and as a treatment for depression and other mental health disorders. Recent evidence suggests that early sensory and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease could be caused by synaptic disruption that occurs before irreversible neuropathology. This raises the possibility that ketamine could slow down or prevent network disruption and the ensuing sensory and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's. Here we tested this idea in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's, using either an acute single injection of ketamine, or chronic daily injections over 15 weeks. We tested the effects of ketamine on both amyloid plaque load and on a behavioral auditory gap detection task that is an early Alzheimer's biomarker in both mice and humans. We found that ketamine had no effect on plaque load, nor any effect on gap detection, for either acute or chronic dosing. Chronic ketamine facilitated startle responses specifically in 5XFAD mice, but this could simply be related to experience-dependent effects on stress or habituation rather than any rescue effect of ketamine on Alzheimer's-related deficits. We did find robust correlations between gap detection deficits and plaque load in auditory cortex and in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus, demonstrating that the behavioral deficits seen in 5XFAD mice are directly related to amyloid accumulation in these brain regions, and confirming the validity of gap detection as an early biomarker of Alzheimer's. Ketamine, however, had no effect on the strength of these correlations. We conclude that ketamine has no beneficial effect on the development of behavioral gap detection deficits or plaque load in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's mouse model, following either an acute single dose or a chronic daily dose regimen.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39749255,"Cardiorespiratory fitness, hippocampal subfield morphology, and episodic memory in older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Age-related hippocampal atrophy is associated with memory loss in older adults, and certain hippocampal subfields are more vulnerable to age-related atrophy than others. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be an important protective factor for preserving hippocampal volume, but little is known about how CRF relates to the volume of specific hippocampal subfields, and whether associations between CRF and hippocampal subfield volumes are related to episodic memory performance. To address these gaps, the current study evaluates the associations among baseline CRF, hippocampal subfield volumes, and episodic memory performance in cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) (NCT02875301).
METHODS: Participants (N = 601, ages 65-80, 72% female) completed assessments including a graded exercise test measuring peak oxygen comsumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) to assess CRF, cognitive testing, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the hippocampus processed with Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS). Separate linear regression models examined whether CRF was associated with hippocampal subfield volumes and whether those assocations were moderated by age or sex. Mediation models examined whether hippocampal volumes statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory performance. Covariates included age, sex, years of education, body mass index, estimated intracranial volume, and study site.
RESULTS: Higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total left (B = 5.82, p = 0.039) and total right (B = 7.64, p = 0.006) hippocampal volume, as well as greater left CA2 (B = 0.14, p = 0.022) and dentate gyrus (DG; B = 2.34, p = 0.031) volume, and greater right CA1 (B = 3.99, p = 0.011), CA2 (B = 0.15, p = 0.002), and subiculum (B = 1.56, p = 0.004) volume. Sex significantly moderated left DG volume (B = -4.26, p = 0.017), such that the association was positive and significant only for males. Total left hippocampal volume [indirect effect = 0.002, 95% CI (0.0002, 0.00), p = 0.027] and right subiculum volume [indirect effect = 0.002, 95% CI (0.0007, 0.01), p = 0.006] statistically mediated the relationship between CRF and episodic memory performance.
DISCUSSION: While higher CRF was significantly associated with greater total hippocampal volume, CRF was not associated with all underlying subfield volumes. Our results further demonstrate the relevance of the associations between CRF and hippocampal volume for episodic memory performance. Finally, our results suggest that the regionally-specific effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on hippocampal subfields could be mitigated by maintaining higher CRF in older adulthood.",Front Aging Neurosci,2024
40194000,Comparison of MK-6240 and Flortaucipir Tau PET for the Biological Staging of Alzheimer Disease (P11-4.004).,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the biological staging of Alzheimer Disease using two different tau PET tracers.
BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's Association workgroup criteria (AA-2024) suggest four biological stages based on PET imaging. However, the application of this framework may vary depending on the tau PET tracer used. Also, the distribution of clinical stages by biological stage may differ.
DESIGN/METHODS: We stratified 182 amyloid-positive participants from the HEAD study (Head-to-Head Harmonization of Tau Tracers in Alzheimer's Disease) that underwent both [18F]MK-6240 and Flortaucipir tau PET. Four clinical stages (normal, transitional, MCI, and dementia) were defined based on the AA-2024 criteria. Within clinical stage-2 (transitional) we assessed subgroups: subjective cognitive decline (SCD), subtle objective cognitive decline (SOCD), and mild behavioral impairment (MBI). Logistic and linear models corrected by age and sex tested association of groups with amyloid and tau pathology. The biological staging was performed using tracer-specific thresholds for regional SUVR and testing three regions of interest schemes: (i)proposed by AA-2024, (ii)Braak stages, (iii)or single anatomical regions. Cohen's weighted-kappa (K) statistic measured clinical-biological and between-tracer agreements.
RESULTS: Clinical stages showed progressively increased prevalence of Aβ-positivity and higher entorhinal tau PET pathology from cognitively normal (CN) to SOCD, MCI, and dementia, in both tracers. MBI and SCD groups showed no increased Aβ or tau pathology compared to CN. For this reason, only SOCD was considered part of stage 2 for following analyses. All tested biological staging strategies showed moderate agreement (Cohen's-kappa 0.34-0.59) with clinical stages for both MK-6240 and Flortaucipir.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that AA-2024 biological and clinical stages show similar clinical-biological concordance using either Flortaucipir or MK-6240, although this can vary based on biological staging method. Only SOCD among transitional stage subgroups showed higher amyloid and tau burden compared to clinical stage 1, while SCD and MBI showed similar pathologic burden to the cognitively normal group.

39854227,Lipid-induced condensate formation from the Alzheimer's Aβ peptide triggers amyloid aggregation.,"The onset and development of Alzheimer's disease is linked to the accumulation of pathological aggregates formed from the normally monomeric amyloid-β peptide within the central nervous system. These Aβ aggregates are increasingly successfully targeted with clinical therapies at later stages of the disease, but the fundamental molecular steps in early stage disease that trigger the initial nucleation event leading to the conversion of monomeric Aβ peptide into pathological aggregates remain unknown. Here, we show that the Aβ peptide can form biomolecular condensates on lipid bilayers both in molecular assays and in living cells. Our results reveal that these Aβ condensates can significantly accelerate the primary nucleation step in the amyloid conversion cascade that leads to the formation of amyloid aggregates. We show that Aβ condensates contain phospholipids, are intrinsically heterogeneous, and are prone to undergo a liquid-to-solid transition leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. These findings uncover the liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of the Aβ peptide and reveal a molecular step very early in the amyloid-β aggregation process.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025
39911633,Lingguizhugan decoction enhances autophagy of Alzheimer's disease via regulating the mTOR/ p70s6K pathway in vivo and in vitro.,"INTRODUCTION: Lingguizhugan decoction (LGZG) has been reported to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) by anti-inflammatory and transporting amyloid-β (Aβ).
METHODS: Using APP/PS1 transgenic mice as in vivo model and gave LGZG decoction by oral gavage. Using Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced SH-SY5Y cells as in vitro model and then added LGZG medicated serum (LMS) to observe the regulatory effect of LGZG on AD autophagy-related pathways. Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate the mice's learning and memory ability. Mice's hippocampus tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically to observe hippocampal Aβ deposition. Transmission electron microscopy monitored autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Western blot analysis measured protein expression levels of beclin-1, p62 and light chain 3II (LC3 II) and mTOR signaling. Results: LGZG could greatly improve learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice, and enhance autophagy in vitro and in vivo. LGZG increased the levels of beclin-1 and LC3 II and decreased the levels of p62.
CONCLUSION: LGZG enhanced autophagy and showed therapeutic potential in AD by inhibiting mTOR/p70s6K signaling.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39711334,Diagnostic accuracy of phosphorylated tau217 in detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology among cognitively impaired and unimpaired: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Our review summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) in detecting amyloid and tau pathology on positron emission tomography (PET). We systematically reviewed studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of plasma and CSF p-tau217, searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science through August 2024. The accuracy of p-tau217 in predicting amyloid and tau pathology on PET was evaluated in 30 studies. Both plasma and CSF p-tau217 effectively detect amyloid and tau PET deposition. Plasma p-tau217 showed 82% sensitivity for detecting amyloid and 83% for tau, with 86% and 83% specificity, respectively. CSF p-tau217 had 79% sensitivity for amyloid and 91% for tau, with 91% and 84% specificity. p-tau217 effectively identifies Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Plasma p-tau217 was comparable to CSF p-tau217 in detecting amyloid deposition on PET. Despite being less sensitive for detecting tau deposition on PET, plasma p-tau217 can be an efficient screening tool for underlying AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) serves as a viable biomarker alternative to cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 due to the strong concordance between their results. Plasma p-tau217 accurately identifies amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) positivity, exhibiting a low rate of false negatives and positives, thereby establishing it as a reliable diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma p-tau217 demonstrates slightly higher accuracy in predicting amyloid PET positivity compared to tau PET positivity. Plasma p-tau217 demonstrates higher predictive accuracy in detecting AD pathology among cognitively impaired individuals, compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals, suggesting its enhanced utility as a diagnostic biomarker in clinical settings.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40166028,Sex-specific Associations of Gene Expression with Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Ante-mortem Cognitive Performance.,"The biological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women remain undefined. While previous case/control studies have identified sex-biased molecular pathways, the sex-specific relationships between gene expression and AD endophenotypes, particularly involving sex chromosomes, are underexplored. With bulk transcriptomic data across 3 brain regions from 767 decedents, we investigated sex-specific associations between gene expression and post-mortem β-amyloid and tau, as well as antemortem longitudinal cognition. Among 23,118 significant gene associations, 10% were sex-specific, with 73% of these identified in females and primarily associated with tau tangles and longitudinal cognition (90%). Notably, four X-linked genes, MCF2 , HDAC8 , FTX , and SLC10A3 , demonstrated significant sex differences in their associations with AD endophenotypes (i.e., significant sex x gene interaction). Our results also uncovered sex-specific biological pathways, including a female-specific role of neuroinflammation and neuronal development, underscoring the importance of sex-aware analyses to advance precision medicine approaches in AD.",Res Sq,2025
40121723,"Long-term nucleus basalis cholinergic lesions alter the structure of cortical vasculature, astrocytic density and microglial activity in Wistar rats.","Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are the sole source of cholinergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in humans and the primary source in rodents. This system undergoes early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. BFCNs terminal synapses are involved in the regulation of the cerebral blood flow by making classical synaptic contacts with other neurons. Additionally, they are located in proximity to cortical cerebral blood vessels, forming connections with various cell types of the neurovascular unit (NVU), including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytic end-feet. However, the effects of the BFCNs input on NVU components remain unresolved. To address this issue, we immunolesioned the nucleus basalis by administering bilateral stereotaxic injections of the cholinergic immunotoxin 192-IgG-Saporin in 2.5-month-old Wistar rats. Seven months post-lesion, we observed a significant reduction in cortical vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive synapses. This was accompanied by changes in the diameter of cortical capillaries and precapillary arterioles, as well as lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Additionally, the cholinergic immunolesion increased the density of cortical astrocytes and microglia in the cortex. At these post-BFCN-lesion stages, astrocytic end-feet exhibited an increased co-localization with arterioles. The number of microglia in the parietal cortex correlated with cholinergic loss and exhibited morphological changes indicative of an intermediate activation state. This was supported by decreased levels of proinflammatory mediators IFN-γ, IL-1β, and KC/GRO (CXCL1), and by increased expression of M2 markers SOCS3, IL4Rα, YM1, ARG1, and Fizz1. Our findings offer a novel insight: that the loss of nucleus basalis cholinergic input negatively impacts cortical blood vessels, NVU components, and microglia phenotype.",Neurobiol Aging,2025
40145494,"Associations among sleep quality, sleep duration, and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","INTRODUCTION: Although sleep disturbances are widely recognized as risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), their influence on AD biomarkers remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify whether sleep quality or sleep duration affect amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET) in non-demented populations.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were systematically searched up to February 2025.
RESULTS: In total, 30 studies were included comprising 14,997 subjects. Individuals with poor sleep quality exhibited greater PET Aβ burden and higher Aβ42 levels in plasma than those with good sleep quality. Shorter sleep duration was associated with higher Aβ burden on PET. However, no association between either sleep quality or sleep duration and tau levels was found.
DISCUSSION: Sleep may be a modifiable marker of early AD management by modulating Aβ levels.
HIGHLIGHTS: lPoor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration were significantly associated with higher amyloid beta (Aβ) burden detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in non-demented populations. Poor sleep quality was also associated with elevated Aβ42 levels in plasma. lNo significant associations were found between sleep quality or sleep duration and tau levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, or PET. lInterventions targeting sleep could serve as a viable and low-cost prevention strategy for early management of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39889000,Investigating gut alterations in Alzheimer's disease: In-depth analysis with micro- and nano-3D X-ray phase contrast tomography.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, remains one of the foremost public health challenges affecting more than 30 million people worldwide with the etiology still largely enigmatic. The intricate gut-brain axis, serving as a vital communication network between the gut and the brain, appears to wield influence in the progression of AD. Our study showcases the remarkable precision of x-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) in conducting an advanced three-dimensional examination of gut cellular composition and structure. The exploitation of micro- and nano-XPCT on various AD mouse models unveiled relevant alterations in villi and crypts, cellular transformations in Paneth and goblet cells, along with the detection of telocytes, neurons, erythrocytes, and mucus secretion by goblet cells within the gut cavity. The observed gut structural variations may elucidate the transition from dysbiosis to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Leveraging XPCT could prove pivotal in early detection and prognosis of the disease.",Sci Adv,2025
39736783,Decoding TDP-43: the molecular chameleon of neurodegenerative diseases.,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has emerged as a critical player in neurodegenerative disorders, with its dysfunction implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted roles of TDP-43 in both physiological and pathological contexts. We delve into TDP-43's crucial functions in RNA metabolism, including splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and miRNA biogenesis. Particular emphasis is placed on recent discoveries regarding TDP-43's involvement in DNA interactions and chromatin dynamics, highlighting its broader impact on gene expression and genome stability. The review also examines the complex pathogenesis of TDP-43-related disorders, discussing the protein's propensity for aggregation, its effects on mitochondrial function, and its non-cell autonomous impacts on glial cells. We provide an in-depth analysis of TDP-43 pathology across various neurodegenerative conditions, from well-established associations in ALS and FTLD to emerging roles in diseases such as Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick C disease. The potential of TDP-43 as a therapeutic target is explored, with a focus on recent developments in targeting cryptic exon inclusion and other TDP-43-mediated processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TDP-43 biology and pathology, offering insights into the protein's central role in neurodegeneration and highlighting promising avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2024
39767577,Role of Microbiota-Derived Hydrogen Sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in Modulating the Gut-Brain Axis: Implications for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis.,"Microbiota-derived hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) plays a crucial role in modulating the gut-brain axis, with significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. H<sub>2</sub>S is produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut and acts as a critical signaling molecule influencing brain health via various pathways, including regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune responses. H<sub>2</sub>S maintains gut barrier integrity at physiological levels and prevents systemic inflammation, which could impact neuroinflammation. However, as H<sub>2</sub>S has a dual role or a Janus face, excessive H<sub>2</sub>S production, often resulting from gut dysbiosis, can compromise the intestinal barrier and exacerbate neurodegenerative processes by promoting neuroinflammation and glial cell dysfunction. This imbalance is linked to the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where the overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>S exacerbates beta-amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, driving neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal damage. Targeting gut microbiota to restore H<sub>2</sub>S homeostasis through dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation presents a promising therapeutic approach. By rebalancing the microbiota-derived H<sub>2</sub>S, these strategies may mitigate neurodegeneration and offer novel treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, underscoring the critical role of the gut-brain axis in maintaining central nervous system health.",Biomedicines,2024
40111934,Lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis indirectly induce neuronal GSK3β-dependent synaptic defects and cause cognitive decline in a low-amyloid-β-concentration environment in Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundLipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.gLPS) are involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of P.gLPS on synaptic defects remains unclear.ObjectiveIn this study, we tested our hypothesis that P.gLPS induces synaptic defects in a low-amyloid-beta (Aβ)-concentration environment.MethodsMG6 microglia or N2a neurons was treated with P.gLPS (0.1 μg/mL), soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub> (0.1 μM) or AL (combined P.gLPS and soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub> at 0.1 μM).ResultsIn cultured MG6 microglia, increased the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and the TNF-α release in parallel with increased NF-κB activation. In cultured N2a neurons, treatment with Aβ<sub>42</sub>, P.gLPS, and AL did not affect the mRNA expression of synapsin1 (SYN1) or post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). However, the treatment with conditioned medium from AL-exposed MG6 microglia (AL-MCM) significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of SYN1, PSD-95, and nuclear translocation of repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) but significantly increased the mRNA expression of TNF receptor type I (at 48 h) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β (at 24 h). TWS119 pretreatment (5 μM), a GSK3β specific inhibitor, significantly reversed the AL-MCM-induced reduction in the mRNA expression of SYN1 and PSD-95 and nuclear translocation of REST in cultured N2a neurons. In APP<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mice, the immunofluorescence intensity of SYN1 and PSD-95 in cortical neurons was positively correlated with the index of the memory test but negatively correlated with that of TNF-α-positive microglia.ConclusionsThese observations demonstrate that P.gLPS induces neuronal GSK3β-dependent synaptic defects in a low-Aβ concentration environment via microglial activation.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39754192,"Integrative multiomics reveals common endotypes across PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutations in familial Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND: PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutations cause Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an early age at onset (AAO) and progressive cognitive decline. PSEN1 mutations are more common and generally have an earlier AAO; however, certain PSEN1 mutations cause a later AAO, similar to those observed in PSEN2 and APP.
METHODS: We examined whether common disease endotypes exist across these mutations with a later AAO (~ 55 years) using hiPSC-derived neurons from familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) patients harboring mutations in PSEN1<sup>A79V</sup>, PSEN2<sup>N141I</sup>, and APP<sup>V717I</sup> and mechanistically characterized by integrating RNA-seq and ATAC-seq.
RESULTS: We identified common disease endotypes, such as dedifferentiation, dysregulation of synaptic signaling, repression of mitochondrial function and metabolism, and inflammation. We ascertained the master transcriptional regulators associated with these endotypes, including REST, ASCL1, and ZIC family members (activation), and NRF1 (repression).
CONCLUSIONS: FAD mutations share common regulatory changes within endotypes with varying severity, resulting in reversion to a less-differentiated state. The regulatory mechanisms described offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",Alzheimers Res Ther,2025
39993207,Deep learning to quantify the pace of brain aging in relation to neurocognitive changes.,"Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P, however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood-brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM's ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals' rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2025
39956966,Structural covariance network patterns linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms in biologically defined Alzheimer's disease: Insights from the mild behavioral impairment checklist.,"BACKGROUND: The frequent presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in the context of normal or minimally-impaired cognitive function led to the concept of Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI). While MBI's impact on subsequent cognitive decline is recognized, its association with brain network changes in biologically-defined AD remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of structural covariance networks with MBI-C checklist sub-scores in biologically-defined AD patients.
METHODS: We analyzed 33 biologically-defined AD patients, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to early dementia, all characterized as amyloid-positive through cerebrospinal fluid analysis or amyloid positron emission tomography scans. Regional network properties were assessed through graph theory.
RESULTS: Affective dysregulation correlated with decreased segregation and integration in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Impulse dyscontrol and social inappropriateness correlated positively with centrality and efficiency in the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Global network properties showed a preserved small-world organization.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals associations between MBI subdomains and structural brain network alterations in biologically-confirmed AD. The IFG's involvement is crucial for mood dysregulation, while the PCC could be involved in compensatory mechanisms for social cognition and impulse control. These findings underscore the significance of biomarker-based neuroimaging for the characterization of NPS across the AD spectrum.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39999928,Towards a better diagnosis and treatment of dementia: Identifying common and distinct neuropathological mechanisms in Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) together contribute to almost 90 % of all dementia cases leading to major health challenges of our time with a substantial global socioeconomic burden. While in AD, the improved understanding of Amyloid beta (Aß) mismetabolism and tau hyperphosphorylation as pathophysiological hallmarks has led to significant clinical breakthroughs, similar advances in VaD are lacking. After comparing the clinical presentation, including risk factors, disease patterns, course of diseases and further diagnostic parameters for both forms of dementia, we highlight the importance of shared pathomechanisms found in AD and VaD: Endothelial damage, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and hypoperfusion inducing oxidative stress and inflammation and thus trophic uncoupling in the neurovascular unit. A dysfunctional endothelium and BBB lead to the accumulation of neurotoxic molecules and Aß through impaired clearance, which in turn leads to neurodegeneration. In this context we discuss possible neuropathological parameters, which might serve as biomarkers and thus improve diagnostic accuracy or reveal targets for novel therapeutic strategies for both forms of dementia.",Neurobiol Dis,2025
39839078,Data-driven discovery of associations between prescribed drugs and dementia risk: A systematic review.,"ABSTRACT: Recent clinical trials on slowing dementia progression have led to renewed focus on finding safer, more effective treatments. One approach to identify plausible candidates is to assess whether existing medications for other conditions may affect dementia risk. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies adopting a data-driven approach to investigate the association between a wide range of prescribed medications and dementia risk. We included 14 studies using administrative or medical records data for more than 130 million individuals and 1 million dementia cases. Despite inconsistencies in identifying specific drugs that may modify Alzheimer's or dementia risk, some themes emerged for drug classes with biological plausibility. Antimicrobials, vaccinations, and anti-inflammatories were associated with reduced risk, while diabetes drugs, vitamins and supplements, and antipsychotics were associated with increased risk. We found conflicting evidence for antihypertensives and antidepressants. Drug repurposing for use in dementia is an urgent priority. Our findings offer a basis for prioritizing candidates and exploring underlying mechanisms.
HIGHLIGHTS: ·We present a systematic review of studies reporting association between drugs prescribed for other conditions and risk of dementia including 139 million people and 1 million cases of dementia.·Our work supports some previously reported associations, for example, showing decreased risk of dementia with drugs to treat inflammatory disease and increased risk with antipsychotic treatment.·Antimicrobial treatment was perhaps more surprisingly associated with decreased risk, supportive of recent increased interest in this potential therapeutic avenue.·Our work should help prioritize drugs for entry into adaptive platform trials in Alzheimer's disease and will serve as a useful resource for those investigating drugs or classes of drugs and risk of dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),2025
39857613,Novel Role of Pin1-Cis P-Tau-ApoE Axis in the Pathogenesis of Preeclampsia and Its Connection with Dementia.,"Preeclampsia (preE) is a severe multisystem hypertensive syndrome of pregnancy associated with ischemia/hypoxia, angiogenic imbalance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated dyslipidemia, placental insufficiency, and inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface. Our recent data further suggest that preE is associated with impaired autophagy, vascular dysfunction, and proteinopathy/tauopathy disorder, similar to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the presence of the cis stereo-isoform of phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau), amyloid-β, and transthyretin in the placenta and circulation. This review provides an overview of the factors that may lead to the induction and accumulation of cis P-tau-like proteins by focusing on the inactivation of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (Pin1) that catalyzes the cis to trans isomerization of P-tau. We also highlighted the novel role of the Pin1-cis P-tau-ApoE axis in the development of preE, and propagation of cis P-tau-mediated abnormal protein aggregation (tauopathy) from the placenta to cerebral tissues later in life, leading to neurodegenerative conditions. In the case of preE, proteinopathy/tauopathy may interrupt trophoblast differentiation and induce cell death, similar to the events occurring in neurons. These events may eventually damage the endothelium and cause systemic features of disorders such as preE. Despite impressive research and therapeutic advances in both fields of preE and neurodegenerative diseases, further investigation of Pin1-cis P-tau and ApoE-related mechanistic underpinnings may unravel novel therapeutic options, and new transcriptional and proteomic markers. This review will also cover genetic polymorphisms in the ApoE alleles leading to dyslipidemia induction that may regulate the pathways causing preE or dementia-like features in the reproductive age or later in life, respectively.",Biomedicines,2024
39924830,Sex-specific effects of apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype on longitudinal hippocampal atrophy in amnestic mild cognitive impairment over a 2-year evaluation period.,"BACKGROUND: Hippocampal atrophy is implicated in the early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is closely associated with rapid cognitive decline and serves as a critical predictor for conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Consequently, with growing interest in utilizing hippocampal volume (HV) as an outcome measure in clinical trials, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying hippocampal atrophy is essential for early diagnosing AD and predicting its progression.
OBJECTIVE: The risk of AD associated with the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele is higher in females than in males. However, the presence of sex-specific effects of the APOE4 genotype on longitudinal hippocampal atrophy (ΔHV) remains unclear. We aimed to examine the effects of the interaction between the APOE4 genotype and sex on ΔHV in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
METHODS: This hospital-based prospective longitudinal study included 73 patients with aMCI. ΔHV, the major outcome measure, was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging performed at a baseline date and 2 years after the baseline evaluation. A two-way analysis of variance was conducted to examine the effects of the interaction between the APOE4 genotype and sex on ΔHV over the 2-year period.
RESULTS: A significant interaction was observed between APOE4 and sex concerning ΔHV (p = 0.036). In females, ΔHV significantly correlated with the APOE4 status. Female APOE4 carriers (ε3/ε4) exhibited 2.3 times higher ΔHV compared with female non-carriers (ε3/ε3) (-0.51 ± 0.28 versus -0.22 ± 0.26, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, ΔHV was not linked to the APOE4 status in males (p = 0.599).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified that the APOE4 genotype affected ΔHV in females. Our findings suggest that female APOE4 carriers, unlike males, may be more susceptible than non-carriers to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of hippocampal atrophy in aMCI.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
40134533,Alteration of prefrontal functional connectivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: an fNIRS study.,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital for delaying its progression through timely intervention. The preclinical stage, the longest phase of AD, often goes undetected due to a lack of noticeable symptoms. Developing an accessible and quantitative screening method for AD is essential for enabling appropriate interventions during this stage.
METHODS: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate prefrontal functional connectivity in preclinical AD subjects. A total of 99 participants, including healthy controls and preclinical subjects who were amyloid beta (Aβ) positive (n = 45), were recruited. We designed a mixed phonemic and semantic verbal fluency task for the experimental protocol. Functional connectivity was then analyzed as z-values in the left, right, and interhemispheric prefrontal regions during a verbal fluency task. Finally, we assessed the correlation between the participants' z-values and clinical indices.
RESULTS: The preclinical AD group exhibited increased interhemispheric functional connectivity derived from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during verbal tasks involving the first phonemic letter. Additionally, significant right and left functional connectivity differences were observed in the healthy control group during verbal tasks with the letter and categories, but not in the preclinical AD group. Lastly, the difference in interhemispheric functional connectivity of oxygenated hemoglobin between the first and second verbal trials was significantly greater in the preclinical AD group. These interhemispheric functional connectivity values were significantly correlated with Aβ results from positron emission tomography.
CONCLUSION: The initial increase and subsequent reduction of interhemispheric functional connectivity in the preclinical AD group across task repetitions suggests that task-related prefrontal network alterations may occur during the preclinical phase of AD and shows its potential as a biomarker for screening preclinical AD.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39794404,Protection of Alzheimer's disease progression by a human-origin probiotics cocktail.,"Microbiome abnormalities (dysbiosis) significantly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the therapeutic efficacy of microbiome modulators in protecting against these ailments remains poorly studied. Herein, we tested a cocktail of unique probiotics, including 5 Lactobacillus and 5 Enterococcus strains isolated from infant gut with proven microbiome modulating capabilities. We aimed to determine the probiotics cocktail's efficacy in ameliorating AD pathology in a humanized AD mouse model of APP/PS1 strains. Remarkably, feeding mice with 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU per day in drinking water for 16 weeks significantly reduced cognitive decline (measured by the Morris Water Maze test) and AD pathology markers, such as Aβ aggregation, microglia activation, neuroinflammation, and preserved blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junctions. The beneficial effects were linked to a reduced inflammatory microbiome, leading to decreased gut permeability and inflammation in both systemic circulation and the brain. Although both male and female mice showed overall improvements in cognition and biological markers, females did not exhibit improvements in specific markers related to inflammation and barrier permeability, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may differ depending on sex. In conclusion, our results suggest that this unique probiotics cocktail could serve as a prophylactic agent to reduce the progression of cognitive decline and AD pathology. This is achieved by beneficially modulating the microbiome, improving intestinal tight junction proteins, reducing permeability in both gut and BBB, and decreasing inflammation in the gut, blood circulation, and brain, ultimately mitigating AD pathology and cognitive decline.",Sci Rep,2025
40194169,In Vivo CSF detection of Lewy Body Pathology in Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease via an Alpha-Synuclein Seeding Amplification Assay (P1-3.010).,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability to detect concurrent Lewy Body (LB) pathology in Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through detection of misfolded alpha-synuclein in CSF using a seed amplification assay (SAA).
BACKGROUND: Neuropathological studies have shown that LB pathology is present in about 50% of cases of sporadic AD and about 30% of Autosomal Dominant AD. Clinical recognition of concurrent LB and AD pathologies in patients is crucial as the presence of both predicts a faster rate of cognitive decline, need to treat additional parkinsonian motor and non-motor symptoms, and a less predictable response to both symptomatic and disease modifying treatments.
DESIGN/METHODS: We collected clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and post-mortem neuropathological data from 31 individuals within families with confirmed Autosomal Dominant AD due to mutations in either PSEN1 or APP. Twenty-two individuals were mutation carriers and 9 were non-carriers. We examined the prevalence of alpha-synuclein SAA positivity in CSF from these individuals. We correlated this data with their clinical presentation and post-mortem neuropathological data.
RESULTS: Of the 22 mutation carriers, 4 (18%) showed positive alpha-synuclein seeding activity. Of the 9 non-carriers, none showed seeding activity. Of the 4 mutation carriers with positive seeding activity, two were asymptomatic, one was mildly symptomatic (Mild Cognitive Impairment, CDR 0.5), and one had mild dementia (CDR 1). Among the 22 mutation carriers, we found no association between alpha-synuclein reactivity and UPDRS III score nor dream enactment behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the presence of LB Pathology in AD, specifically Autosomal Dominant AD, can in fact be detected via the presence of alpha-synuclein seeding activity in CSF. This can occur during both the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease. Interestingly, our data also shows that like LB pathology on autopsy, the presence of misfolded alpha-synuclein in CSF varies from person-to-person within a family with the same mutation.

39788739,Precuneus Activity during Retrieval Is Positively Associated with Amyloid Burden in Cognitively Normal Older APOE4 Carriers.,"The precuneus is a site of early amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation. Previous cross-sectional studies reported increased precuneus fMRI activity in older adults with mild cognitive deficits or elevated Aβ. However, longitudinal studies in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are lacking and the relationship to the Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype is unclear. Investigating the PREVENT-AD dataset, we assessed how baseline and longitudinal precuneus activity during successful memory retrieval relates to future Aβ and tau burden and change in memory performance. We further studied the moderation by APOE4 genotype. We included 165 older adults (age, 62.8 ± 4.4 years; 113 female; 66 APOE4 carriers) who were cognitively normal at baseline with a family history of AD. All participants performed task-fMRI at baseline and underwent <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir-PET and <sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694-Aβ-PET on average 5 years later. We found that higher baseline activity and greater longitudinal increase in precuneus activity were associated with higher Aβ burden in APOE4 carriers but not noncarriers. We observed no effects of precuneus activity on tau burden. Finally, APOE4 noncarriers with low baseline precuneus activity exhibited better longitudinal performance in an independent memory test compared with (1) noncarriers with higher baseline activity and (2) APOE4 carriers. Our findings suggest that higher task-related precuneus activity during memory retrieval at baseline and over time are associated with greater Aβ burden in cognitively normal APOE4 carriers. Our results further indicate that the absence of ""hyperactivation"" and the absence of the APOE4 allele is related with better future cognitive outcomes in cognitively normal older adults at risk for AD.",J Neurosci,2025
40096060,Local genetic covariance analysis with lipid traits identifies novel loci for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.,"The genetic component of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), accounting for ~10% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, is largely unexplained. Recent studies suggest that EOAD may be enriched for variants acting in the lipid pathway. The current study examines the shared genetic heritability between EOAD and the lipid pathway using genome-wide multi-trait genetic covariance analyses. Summary statistics were obtained from the GWAS meta-analyses of EOAD by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (n=19,668) and five blood lipid traits by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (n=1,320,016). The significant results were compared between the EOAD and lipids GWAS and genetic covariance analyses were performed via SUPERGNOVA. Genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with top EOAD hits in identified regions of covariance with lipid traits were scored and ranked for causality by combining evidence from gene-based analysis, AD-risk scores incorporating transcriptomic and proteomic evidence, eQTL data, eQTL colocalization analyses, DNA methylation data, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Direct comparison of GWAS results showed 5 loci overlapping between EOAD and at least one lipid trait harboring APOE, TREM2, MS4A4E, LILRA5, and LRRC25. Local genetic covariance analyses identified 3 regions of covariance between EOAD and at least one lipid trait. Gene prioritization nominated 3 likely causative genes at these loci: ANKDD1B, CUZD1, and MS4A64.The current study identified genetic covariance between EOAD and lipids, providing further evidence of shared genetic architecture and mechanistic pathways between the two traits.",PLoS Genet,2025
39877983,APP antisense oligonucleotides are effective in rescuing mitochondrial phenotypes in human iPSC-derived trisomy 21 astrocytes.,"INTRODUCTION: Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have shown promise in reducing amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in neurons, but their effects in astrocytes, key contributors to neurodegenerative diseases, remain unclear. This study evaluates the efficacy of APP ASOs in astrocytes derived from an individual with Down syndrome (DS), a population at high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a healthy individual and an individual with DS were differentiated into astrocytes. Astrocytes were treated with APP ASOs for 10 days, and APP levels were quantified. Mitochondrial morphology and superoxide production in DS astrocytes were analyzed using super-resolution and confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: APP ASOs significantly reduced APP levels in astrocytes from both control and DS individuals. In DS astrocytes, treatment restored mitochondrial health, increasing mitochondrial number and size while reducing superoxide production.
DISCUSSION: APP ASOs effectively reduce APP levels and improve mitochondrial health in astrocytes, suggesting their potential as a therapeutic approach for DS and DS-related AD. Further in vivo studies are required to confirm these findings.
HIGHLIGHTS: APP ASOs reduce APP levels in human iPSC-derived astrocytes. APP ASO treatment rescues mitochondrial phenotypes in trisomy 21 astrocytes. This study supports ASOs as a potential therapy for Down syndrome-related Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
39706744,Brain Metabolic Resilience in Alzheimer's Disease: A Predictor of Cognitive Decline and Conversion to Dementia.,"OBJECTIVE: Brain atrophy measured by structural imaging has been used to quantify resilience against neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Considering glucose hypometabolism is another marker of neurodegeneration, we quantified metabolic resilience (MR) based on Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and investigated its clinical implications.
METHODS: We quantified the MR and other resilience metrics, including brain resilience (BR) and cognitive resilience (CR), using partial least squares path modeling from the ADNI database. A linear mixed-effects model and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify the impact of each resilience on longitudinal cognitive function and conversion to dementia, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 848 participants were included in this study. All resilience metrics (CR, BR, and MR) were associated with slower cognitive decline. Results from the ANOVA test, AIC and BIC values showed that the additional inclusion of MR improved the performances of the linear mixed effect models. In survival analysis, all resilience variables were negatively associated with the risk of conversion to dementia. In line with the results of the linear mixed effects models, the additional inclusion of MR into the models with different resilience variables increased the C-index.
CONCLUSION: Relative preservation of brain glucose metabolism is a valuable predictor of future cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, adding value to existing resilience metrics. While the utility of FDG PET in clinical settings is limited by cost and accessibility, it might have potential usefulness as a prognostic marker, especially in a context of resilience.",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,2024
40033044,"Brain O-GlcNAcylation: Bridging physiological functions, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic applications.","O-GlcNAcylation, a dynamic post-translational modification occurring on serine or threonine residues of numerous proteins, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including gene regulation, metabolism, and stress response. Abundant in the brain, O-GlcNAcylation intricately governs neurodevelopment, synaptic assembly, and neuronal functions. Recent investigations have established a correlation between the dysregulation of brain O-GlcNAcylation and a broad spectrum of neurological disorders and injuries, spanning neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric conditions, as well as injuries to the central nervous system (CNS). Manipulating O-GlcNAcylation has demonstrated neuroprotective properties against these afflictions. This review delineates the roles and mechanisms of O-GlcNAcylation in the CNS under both physiological and pathological circumstances, with a focus on its neuroprotective effects in neurological disorders and injuries. We discuss the involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in key processes such as neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism, as well as its implications in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Additionally, we explore prospective therapeutic approaches for CNS disorders and injuries by targeting O-GlcNAcylation, highlighting recent clinical developments and future research directions. This comprehensive overview aims to provide insights into the potential of O-GlcNAcylation as a therapeutic target and guide future investigations in this promising field.",Mol Psychiatry,2025
40155425,A novel method for estimating functional connectivity from EEG coherence potentials.,"Analysis of functional connectivity can provide insights into how the brain performs various cognitive and behavioral tasks as well as the neural mechanisms underlying several pathologies. In this work, we describe a novel approach to estimate functional connectivity from electroencephalography (EEG) data using the concept of coherence potentials (CPs), which are defined as clusters of high-amplitude deflections with similar waveform shapes. We define connectivity measures based on features of CPs, including the time intervals between CP peaks and their co-occurrence on different electrodes or channels. We used EEG data from 25 healthy subjects performing three tasks - resting state (eyes closed and eyes open), working memory and pattern completion tasks to investigate the ability of CP based connectivity measures to distinguish between these tasks. When compared with traditional connectivity measures including several spectral-based measures and mutual information, our results showed that CP based connectivity measures more robustly and significantly distinguished between all the tasks both at group-level and subject-level. In conclusion, CP based EEG connectivity measures provide a reliable way to distinguish between different cognitive task conditions and could pave way in the early detection of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease that affect various cognitive tasks.",Sci Rep,2025
39740074,Clinical use of biomarkers in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatments.,"With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well-validated biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of test results may be complex and depends on the pre-test probability and test-specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non-dementia specialists to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40116690,Social functioning in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and the situation of caregivers.,"BackgroundChanges in social functioning may be a significant parameter for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, research on social functioning in AD across the entire spectrum of the disease is lacking.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to describe the social functioning of persons with AD at each stage of the disease and to investigate how impaired social functioning affects caregiver burden.MethodsCross-sectional data was derived from memory clinics across Germany as part of the pilot study ""Social functioning in individuals with AD and the situation of caregivers"". A total of N = 87 relatives providing care for individuals with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 40), and severe (n = 23) AD were included. Social functioning of individuals with AD was measured via the caregiver-rated German version of the Social Functioning in Dementia Scale (SF-DEM); caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-12). Differences between mild, moderate, and severe AD in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and the level of social functioning were examined. A robust linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between social functioning and caregiver burden.ResultsSocial functioning was lower in moderate and severe AD than in mild AD. Higher levels of social functioning were associated with less caregiver burden.ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of integrating social functioning assessments into clinical practice for improving the early detection, diagnosis and interventions for AD. Early interventions to enhance social functioning may diminish caregiver burden.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39807622,Decoding brain structure to stage Alzheimer's disease pathology in Down syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Down syndrome (DS) is associated with changes in brain structure. It is unknown if thickness and volumetric changes can identify AD stages and if they are similar to other genetic forms of AD.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 178 DS adults (106 nonclinical, 45 preclinical, and 27 symptomatic). Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were compared between DS groups and evaluated as a staging metric using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Thickness patterns were compared to those previously reported in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD).
RESULTS: Decreased parietal and temporal lobe thickness differentiated amyloid positivity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and impairment (AUC = 0.81), and slightly outperformed subcortical volumes (AUC = 0.8/0.74). Thickness differences in DS were more widespread, severe, and had better discriminative ability than ADAD.
DISCUSSION: Cortical thickness can stage AD pathology in DS. Identification of brain regions affected by AD may aid in tracking disease course and evaluating treatment effects.
HIGHLIGHTS: DSAD is associated with reduced temporal and parietal cortical thickness. DSAD is associated with smaller hippocampal and striatal volumes. Thickness differences can stage DSAD better than other forms of AD. DSAD thickness differences are more extensive and severe than ADAD.",Alzheimers Dement,2025
40087672,Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and its estimation with fluid and imaging biomarkers.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by the extracellular deposition of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and the intraneuronal accumulation of abnormal phosphorylated tau (τ)-protein (p-τ). Most frequently, these hallmark lesions are accompanied by other co-pathologies in the brain that may contribute to cognitive impairment, such as vascular lesions, intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated transactive-response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and/or α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. To estimate the extent of these AD and co-pathologies in patients, several biomarkers have been developed. Specific tracers target and visualize Aβ plaques, p-τ and αSyn pathology or inflammation by positron emission tomography. In addition to these imaging biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-based biomarker assays reflecting AD-specific or non-specific processes are either already in clinical use or in development. In this review, we will introduce the pathological lesions of the AD brain, the related biomarkers, and discuss to what extent the respective biomarkers estimate the pathology determined at post-mortem histopathological analysis. It became evident that initial stages of Aβ plaque and p-τ pathology are not detected with the currently available biomarkers. Interestingly, p-τ pathology precedes Aβ deposition, especially in the beginning of the disease when biomarkers are unable to detect it. Later, Aβ takes the lead and accelerates p-τ pathology, fitting well with the known evolution of biomarker measures over time. Some co-pathologies still lack clinically established biomarkers today, such as TDP-43 pathology or cortical microinfarcts. In summary, specific biomarkers for AD-related pathologies allow accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on pathobiological parameters. Although current biomarkers are excellent measures for the respective pathologies, they fail to detect initial stages of the disease for which post-mortem analysis of the brain is still required. Accordingly, neuropathological studies remain essential to understand disease development especially in early stages. Moreover, there is an urgent need for biomarkers reflecting co-pathologies, such as limbic predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy-related pathology, which is known to modify the disease by interacting with p-τ. Novel biomarker approaches such as extracellular vesicle-based assays and cryptic RNA/peptides may help to better detect these co-pathologies in the future.",Mol Neurodegener,2025
39924842,Brain-penetrant histone deacetylase inhibitor RG2833 improves spatial memory in females of an Alzheimer's disease rat model.,"BackgroundNearly two-thirds of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are women. Therapeutics for women are critical to lowering their elevated risk of developing this major cause of adult dementia. Moreover, targeting epigenetic processes such as histone acetylation that regulate multiple cellular pathways is advantageous given the multifactorial nature of AD. Histone acetylation takes part in memory consolidation, and its disruption is linked to AD.ObjectiveDetermine whether the investigational drug RG2833 has repurposing potential for AD. RG2833 is a histone deacetylase HDAC1/3 inhibitor that is orally bioavailable and permeates the blood-brain-barrier.MethodsRG2833 effects were determined on cognition, transcriptome, and AD-like pathology in 11-month TgF344-AD female and male rats. Treatment started early in the course of pathology when therapeutic intervention is predicted to be most effective.ResultsRG2833-treatment of 11-month TgF344-AD rats: (1) Significantly improved hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in females but not males. (2) Upregulated expression of immediate early genes, such as Arc, Egr1 and c-Fos, and other genes involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation in females. Remarkably, out of 17,168 genes analyzed for each sex, no significant changes in gene expression were detected in males at p < 0.05, false discovery rate <0.05, and fold-change equal or > 1.5. (3) Failed to improve amyloid beta accumulation and microgliosis in female and male TgF344-AD rats.ConclusionsOur study highlights the potential of histone-modifying therapeutics such as RG2833 to improve cognitive behavior and drive the expression of immediate early, synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation genes, especially in female AD patients.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39991795,Cognitive vulnerability to glucose fluctuations: A digital phenotype of neurodegeneration.,"INTRODUCTION: Cognition is reduced at low and high glucose, reflecting cognitive vulnerability to glucose (CVG) fluctuations. The impact of glucose fluctuations on the aging brain remains unclear. We examined whether CVG is associated with plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Participants included N = 114 adults with type 1 diabetes assessed for processing speed and sustained attention using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We characterized associations between CVG and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein.
RESULTS: CVG was associated with all plasma biomarkers, except Aβ 42/40. CVG for sustained attention exhibited strong associations with p-tau biomarkers that persisted across covariate specifications.
DISCUSSION: CVG may be a useful digital phenotype of AD. It remains unclear whether CVG contributes to versus arises from neurodegeneration. We consider possible mechanisms linking cognitive vulnerability and long-term glucose variability to the development of neuropathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive vulnerability to glucose (CVG) may be a useful digital phenotype of neurodegeneration. We used cognitive ecological momentary assessment and continuous glucose monitoring to investigate CVG's associations with plasma biomarkers.

39924916,Perceived risk of Alzheimer's disease: Insights into the Black and African American male perspective.,"BackgroundNon-Hispanic Black and African American men are more likely to have Alzheimer's disease (AD) than non-Hispanic White peers. Despite this, little is known about how Black and African American men perceive dementia risk, which is foundational to prevention.ObjectiveAcknowledging that personal vantage point influences behavior, our study examined Black and African American male perceptions about their anticipated risk for AD.MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of Black and African American adult male responses to the Recruitment Innovations for Diversity Enhancement electronic survey study. We examined associations between perceived risk of AD and age, education, employment status, household income adequacy, marital status, living status, prior experience with AD, and subjective memory performance using generalized linear models.ResultsRespondents (n = 112) were age 18 to 79 years (M = 51.05, SD = 13.44), and 35% reported prior experience with AD through a friend or family member. Respondents' perceived risk of developing AD ranged from 0 to 100% (M = 33.46, SD = 28.29). Spearman rho correlations revealed modest but significant correlations between perceived risk and age (r = 21, p = 0.03) and marital status (r = -0.22 p = 0.02). The best fitting generalized linear model revealed low perceived risk for AD was associated with younger age, income adequacy and being married or living as married (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 8.76, p = 0.03).ConclusionSelected social determinants of health were associated with perceived risk. Future studies should examine additional social determinants of health (e.g., social and physical environment) and measures of cognitive and physical health to further explore relationships with perceived risk of AD in Black and African American males.",J Alzheimers Dis,2025
39860337,Neuroinflammation: A Driving Force in the Onset and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background/Objectives: The goal of this commentary is to highlight several key components of the inflammatory process as it relates to amyloid toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the role of neuroinflammatory factors and peripheral inflammatory events. Methods: Google Scholar and PubMed were used to find articles with the following keywords: Alzheimer's disease, amyloids, neuroinflammation, peripheral inflammation, microglia, cytokines, and treatments. Sources that were case reports, not peer-reviewed, or older than 30 years were excluded. Abstracts were reviewed first for their relevance before the full text was considered. Methods sections were reviewed to ensure the interventional papers included were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews; however, several literature reviews were also included due to the relevance of their background information. Results: Based on the literature review, we chose to concentrate on microglia, cytokine signaling, and peripheral inflammation markers. We found that microglia activation and subsequent microglia-driven inflammation play a pivotal role in the pathomechanism of AD. Additionally, cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) appear to contribute to amyloid accumulation and cell damage. Finally, the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) allows for the peripheral inflammatory process to contribute to the inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that the immune system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, both in the CNS and the periphery.",J Clin Med,2025

39837288,Global Burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias during 1990-2021: A Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors Study 2021-Based Study.,"INTRODUCTION: In most countries and territories, current data on the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are lacking. We aimed to assess the trends, burden, and inequalities of AD and other dementias at global, regional, and national level from 1990 to 2021.
METHODS: The data on disease burden of AD and other dementias during 1990-2021 were extracted from Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors Study 2021 (GBD 2021). Average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) of age-standardized prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated as an indicator to evaluate the healthcare system.
RESULT: The global age-standardized prevalence of AD and other dementias increased from 672 (95% uncertainty interval: 589 to 764) per 100,000 population in 1990 to 694 (603 to 794) per 100,000 population in 2021, with AAPCs of 0.09% (95% confidence interval: 0.06% to 0.11%). However, age-standardized mortality did not change (AAPCs: 0.00% [-0.01% to 0.02%]) and age-standardized DALYs slightly increased from 446 (206 to 958) to 451 (213 to 950) per 100,000 population (AAPCs: 0.01% [0.00% to 0.03%]). While the highest prevalence remained in population aged 65-69 and the countries with a high-middle sociodemographic index (SDI) such as East Asia (e.g., China), the highest mortality and DALYs were found in population aged 65-69 and the countries with a low-middle SDI such as South Asia (e.g., India). High fasting plasma glucose ranked the highest risk factor for DALYs during 1990-2021.
CONCLUSION: The global increased prevalence of AD and other dementias may partly be attributed to population aged 65-69 in the countries with a high-middle SDI (e.g., China), whereas mortality and DALY ratio of population aged 65-69 from the countries with a low-middle SDI (e.g., India) is most significantly growing. Controlling of high fasting plasma glucose may be needed for the reduction of DALYs from AD and other dementias.",Neuroepidemiology,2025
40055292,Apolipoprotein E ε4-Specific Relationship Between Serum Olfactomedin 4 and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) plays important roles in inflammation, immune regulation, apoptosis, and neurodevelopment. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of serum OLFM4 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its clinical phenotype in different apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. Serum OLFM4 levels were measured in 122 AD patients and 113 healthy controls (HC). Correlations between OLFM4 levels and cognitive function and brain volume were analyzed in the context of APOE ε4 status. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess the contribution of high OLFM4 levels and APOE ε4 status to the risk of AD. It turns out that serum OLFM4 levels were significantly higher in patients with AD than in HC and were associated with APOE ε4 status but not sex. Serum OLFM4 levels showed a dose-response relationship with cognitive function and were correlated with brain atrophy. The combination of high OLFM4 levels and APOE ε4 expression was a risk factor for AD (odds ratio = 5.440; p = 0.017). In conclusion, serum OLFM4 may be involved in the pathology of AD and holds promise as a potential biomarker of AD as well as a therapeutic target. And the effects of OLFM4 for AD may be mediated by APOE ε4.",Mol Neurobiol,2025

METHODS: We conducted a clinical and cognitive evaluation, APOE genotyping, determination of AD biomarkers in CSF, structural MRI, [18F]FDG-PET, and tau-PET ([18F]PI2620) scans.
RESULTS: A 39-year-old man with DS and mild intellectual disability presented with progressive visuoperceptual disturbances over 18 months. Examination revealed global cognitive impairment, with notable visual agnosia and neglect. The patient also exhibited significant constructive and oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia, alexia, agraphia, and prosopagnosia. The patient was determined to be APOE3 homozygous, and CSF analysis was consistent with AD pathophysiology. T1-weighted MRI revealed predominant parieto-occipital atrophy. FDG-PET showed significant bilateral hypometabolism in the parietotemporal and occipital cortices, and tau-PET demonstrated pathologic uptake in the parietal, precuneus/posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and occipital cortices.
DISCUSSION: This well-characterized case of PCA syndrome due to AD in a very young patient with DS demonstrates the occurrence of atypical presentations in DS that might be overshadowed by the baseline intellectual disability associated with DS.",Neurology,2025
39949539,Evidence from NHANES 2011-2014: a correlation between the weight-adjusted-waist index and cognitive abilities in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity exerts a significant detrimental impact on cognitive function. The weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) serves as a more precise indicator of visceral obesity that is independent of weight, in contrast to body mass index (BMI). Still, little research has been conducted on the interrelation between WWI and cognitive abilities. This investigation explored the link between WWI and older Americans' cognitive function.
METHODS: Utilizing data from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Cross-Sectional Survey, multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the influence of WWI on cognitive abilities in those over 60. Three cognitive assessments were administered: the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and the Word Learning and Recall Module from the Coalition to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD). We implemented threshold effects analysis and smoothed curve fitting to elucidate the nonlinear relationship. Additionally, we analyzed subgroups to check for variability.
RESULTS: There were 2,762 participants, including1,504 (54.45%) females and 1,258 (45.55%) males. 53.77% of them had completed high school or above, and their average age was 69.05 ± 6.62. After controlling for confounding variables, the improved model predicted a negative connection between WWI and CERAD-Total, AFT, and DSST scores (all p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we performed a smoothenable curve fitting between WWI and cognitive function scores, resulting in a nonlinear connection and a threshold saturation effect. We also executed subgroup analyses and interaction tests based on gender, race, educational background, marital status, diabetes, body mass index, alcohol consumption, hypertension, smoking habits, stroke, depression, and sleep quality to assess whether the relationship between WWI and cognitive function was affected by heterogeneity across different population segments. The subgroup analysis found no significant differences in cognitive performance associated with WWI across the various subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Higher WWI levels are associated with impaired cognitive function in Americans aged 60 and older.",Front Aging Neurosci,2025
39766777,Is the Relationship Between Cardiovascular Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Genetic? A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two diseases highly prevalent in the aging population and often co-occur. The exact relationship between the two diseases is uncertain, though epidemiological studies have demonstrated that CVDs appear to increase the risk of AD and vice versa. This scoping review aims to examine the current identified overlapping genetics between CVDs and AD at the individual gene level and at the shared pathway level.
METHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines for a scoping review, we searched the PubMed and Scopus databases from 1990 to October 2024 for articles that involved (1) CVDs, (2) AD, and (3) used statistical methods to parse genetic relationships.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 2918 articles, of which 274 articles passed screening and were organized into two main sections: (1) evidence of shared genetic risk; and (2) shared mechanisms. The genes APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2 reportedly have wide effects across the AD and CVD spectrum, affecting both cardiac and brain tissues. Mechanistically, changes in three main pathways (lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)) contribute to subclinical and etiological changes that promote both AD and CVD progression. However, genetic studies continue to be limited by the availability of longitudinal data and lack of cohorts that are representative of diverse populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Highly penetrant familial genes simultaneously increase the risk of CVDs and AD. However, in most cases, sets of dysregulated genes within larger-scale mechanisms, like changes in lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and BBB breakdown, increase the risk of both AD and CVDs and contribute to disease progression.",Genes (Basel),2024
40055831,Antagonizing Il10 and Il4 signaling via intracerebral decoy receptor expression attenuates Aβ accumulation.,"Multiple lines of evidence indicate that immune signaling can impact the pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including amyloid deposition, tau aggregation, synaptic pathology and neurodegenerative trajectory. In earlier studies, we reported that intracerebral expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-10 (Il10) and Interleukin-4 (Il4), increased amyloid β (Aβ) burden in TgCRND8 mice, a preclinical model of AD-type amyloidosis. As both Interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R) and Interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) are upregulated in an age-progressive manner in rodent models of AD and in specific regions of human AD brains, we hypothesized that a decoy receptor strategy specifically targeting Il10 and Il4 signaling could have a disease-modifying effect. We derivatized the ectodomains of mouse Il10R (sIl10R) and mouse Il4R (sIl4R) into corresponding recombinant solubilized receptor forms and delivered these intracranially into neonatal TgCRND8 mice or hippocampally into adult TgCRND8 mice with pre-existing Aβ deposits. AAV-mediated expression of sIl10R and sIl4R robustly attenuated Aβ burden in TgCRND8 mice when expressed neonatally while in the hippocampus injection cohort, AAV-sIl4R, but not sIl10R, reduced Aβ burden. sIl10R and sIl4R had opposing effects on microglial and astrocyte proliferation, with sIl10R generally reducing gliosis. RNAseq analysis showed that sIl10R likely acts as a microglial immune checkpoint inhibitor while both sIl10R and sIl4R expression show unexpected impacts on genes related to circadian rhythm. Notably, neither Il10 nor sIl10R expression altered tau pathology in two tau transgenic models, despite robust expression and impacts on glial proliferation. Together, these data reveal that decoy receptor mediated targeting of physiological Il10 or Il4 signaling can beneficially impact amyloid deposition and thus represent novel immunomodulatory approaches for AD therapy.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2025
39939326,UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS profiling of phenolic compounds in Fagonia arabica L. and evaluation of their cholinesterase inhibition potential through in-vitro and in-silico approaches.,"Fagonia arabica L. is a widely used traditional medicinal herb. This study explored the flavonoid and phenolic acid content in the aerial parts of F. arabica, leading to the tentative identification of 42 compounds using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass/Mass Spectrometry and analyzed with the phytochemical-focused RIKEN tandem mass spectral database (ReSpect) for identification based on authentic standards. The total phenolic and flavonoid content was measured in the ethyl acetate and butanol fractions. The flavonoid content in the ethyl acetate fraction was 101 ± 1.43 µg Rutin/mg, compared to 6.48 ± 0.29 µg rutin/mg in the butanol fraction. Similarly, the ethyl acetate fraction contained 199.14 ± 1.58 µg gallic acid/mg, while the butanol fraction had 47.69 ± 0.54 µg gallic acid/mg. Also, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the different fractions of Fagonia arabica L. in inhibiting the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme, which is a key contributor to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. At a concentration of 0.45 mg/mL, the ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest efficiency, inhibiting butyrylcholinesterase by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>). Based on the in vitro results, a molecular docking study suggested the selectivity of the tentatively identified compounds towards butyrylcholinesterase over acetylcholinesterase, as kaempferol-3-O-glucoside achieved the highest selectivity. This insight could inform potential modifications to enhance selectivity, which may be applied in the synthesis, semi-synthesis, and development of novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease.",Sci Rep,2025
39822299,Association between choroidal microvasculature in the eye and Alzheimer's disease risk in cognitively healthy mid-life adults: A pilot study.,"INTRODUCTION: We explored associations between measurements of the ocular choroid microvasculature and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.
METHODS: We measured the choroidal vasculature appearing in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of 69 healthy, mid-life individuals in the PREVENT Dementia cohort. The cohort was prospectively split into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups based on the presence of known risk factors (apolipoprotein E [APOE] ε4 genotype and family history of dementia [FH]). We used ordinal logistic regression to test for cross-sectional associations between choroidal measurements and AD risk.
RESULTS: Choroidal vasculature was progressively larger between ordinal risk groups, and significantly associated with risk group prediction. APOE ε4 carriers had thicker choroids and larger vascularity compared to non-carriers. Similar trends were observed for those with a FH.
DISCUSSIONS: Our results suggest a potential link between the choroidal vasculature and AD risk. However, these exploratory findings should be replicated in a larger sample.
HIGHLIGHTS: Ocular choroidal microvasculature is of interest in relation to neurodegeneration due to its autonomic response to systemic, pathophysiological change.Choroidal changes in the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unexplored.The PREVENT Dementia cohort offers a unique, non-invasive study of the microvasculature in mid-life individuals at increased risk for developing AD.Significantly increased ocular choroidal vasculature was associated with increased risk (apolipoprotein E carrier and/or family history of dementia) for AD.These exploratory results suggest a potential association between the ocular choroidal vasculature and AD risk. However, findings should be replicated in a larger sample.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2025
40139174,Thyroid Disorders as a Risk Factor for Neurodegenerative Proteinopathies: A Large-Scale Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between thyroid disorders and neurodegenerative diseases remains poorly understood. This large-scale retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the association between thyroid disorders and various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the potential impact of thyroidectomy.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,719,666 patients with thyroid disorders and 2,945,438 controls from 120 healthcare organizations. After propensity score matching, each group included 2,033,096 patients. We compared the risk of neurodegenerative diseases between these groups and examined the effect of thyroidectomy in a subgroup analysis of 31,753 matched pairs.
RESULTS: Patients with thyroid disorders showed significantly higher risks of Alzheimer's disease (RR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.110-1.195), Parkinson's disease (RR=1.25, 95%CI: 1.187-1.318), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RR=1.35, 95%CI: 1.131-1.622), frontotemporal dementia (RR=1.44, 95%CI: 1.219-1.702), Lewy body dementia (RR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.107-1.186), progressive supranuclear palsy (RR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.095-1.819), vascular dementia (RR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.266-1.369), Niemann-Pick disease type C (RR=1.34, 95%CI: 1.092-1.638), and Wilson's disease (RR=1.26, 95%CI: 1.056-1.507). Interestingly, the risk of multiple sclerosis was lower (RR=0.80, 95%CI: 0.738-0.862). Thyroidectomy was associated with a 44.2% lower risk of Lewy body dementia (RR=0.558, 95%CI: 0.339-0.919, p=0.020).
CONCLUSION: Thyroid disorders are significantly associated with an increased risk of several neurodegenerative diseases. Thyroidectomy may have a protective effect against Lewy body dementia. These findings suggest a complex relationship between thyroid function and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for neurological monitoring in patients with thyroid disorders and further research into thyroid-brain interactions.",Neuroepidemiology,2025
