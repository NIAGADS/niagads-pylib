39392298,Systematic evaluation of multifactorial causal associations for Alzheimer's disease and an interactive platform MRAD developed based on Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex degenerative disease of the central nervous system, and elucidating its pathogenesis remains challenging. In this study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD (https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance our understanding of the etiology of AD.",Elife,2024
23233682,Effects of early-life adversity on cognitive decline in older African Americans and whites.,"OBJECTIVES: Early-life adversity is related to adult health in old age but little is known about its relation with cognitive decline.
METHODS: Participants included more than 6,100 older residents (mean age = 74.9 [7.1] years; 61.8% African American) enrolled in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a geographically defined, population-based study of risk factors for Alzheimer disease. Participants were interviewed at approximately 3-year intervals for up to 16 years. The interview included a baseline evaluation of early-life adversity, and administration of 4 brief cognitive function tests to assess change in cognitive function. We estimated the relation of early-life adversity to rate of cognitive decline in a series of mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: In models stratified by race, and adjusted for age and sex, early-life adversity was differentially related to decline in African Americans and whites. Whereas no measure of early-life adversity related to cognitive decline in whites, both food deprivation and being thinner than average in early life were associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in African Americans. The relations were not mediated by years of education and persisted after adjustment for cardiovascular factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Markers of early-life adversity had an unexpected protective effect on cognitive decline in African Americans.",Neurology,2012
31802237,Necrosome complex detected in granulovacuolar degeneration is associated with neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a specific pattern of neuropathological changes, including extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) representing cytoplasmic vacuolar lesions, synapse dysfunction and neuronal loss. Necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis characterized by the assembly of the necrosome complex composed of phosphorylated proteins, i.e. receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and 3 (pRIPK1 and pRIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), has recently been shown to be involved in AD. However, it is not yet clear whether necrosome assembly takes place in brain regions showing AD-related neuronal loss and whether it is associated with AD-related neuropathological changes. Here, we analyzed brains of AD, pathologically defined preclinical AD (p-preAD) and non-AD control cases to determine the neuropathological characteristics and distribution pattern of the necrosome components. We demonstrated that all three activated necrosome components can be detected in GVD lesions (GVDn+, i.e. GVD with activated necrosome) in neurons, that they colocalize with classical GVD markers, such as pTDP-43 and CK1δ, and similarly to these markers detect GVD lesions. GVDn + neurons inversely correlated with neuronal density in the early affected CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the late affected frontal cortex layer III. Additionally, AD-related GVD lesions were associated with AD-defining parameters, showing the strongest correlation and partial colocalization with NFT pathology. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of the necrosome in GVD plays a role in AD, possibly by representing an AD-specific form of necroptosis-related neuron death. Hence, necroptosis-related neuron loss could be an interesting therapeutic target for treating AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2020
36327171,The effect of race and co-morbidities on Alzheimer's disease based on Medicare data.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence is thought to be higher among Black than White individuals.
METHODS: We studied the US Medicare population from 2000 to 2018. Cox regression was used to determine the roles of race and co-morbidities for AD incidence.
RESULTS: We studied 11,880,906 Medicare beneficiaries, with 774,548 AD cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) by increasing numbers of co-morbidities (1-7) were 1.51, 2.00, 2.55, 3.16, 2.89, 4.77, and 5.65. Among those with no co-morbidities, Black individuals had a lower rate than those who are White (HR = 0.69), while among those with one more co-morbidities, Black individuals had a higher rate (HR = 1.19). The presence of hypertension increased AD rates by 14% for White individuals, but 69% for those who are Black.
DISCUSSION: More co-morbidities was strongly associated with higher AD rates. The higher rates for Black versus White individuals was apparent only for those with co-morbidities and appears driven both by more co-morbidities, and the greater effect of hypertension.
HIGHLIGHTS: Black individuals have been shown to have higher Alzheimer's disease (AD) rates than those who are White. Some co-morbidities are known to increase AD risk. Among those In Medicare data with no co-morbidities, Black individuals have less risk than those who are White. Among those with co-morbidities, Black individuals have higher rates than those who are White. Hypertension results in a much stronger increase in AD risk for Black versus White individuals.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
31564046,"Observational and genetic studies of short telomeres and Alzheimer's disease in 67,000 and 152,000 individuals: a Mendelian randomization study.","Short telomeres might lead to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, but observational analyses have been inconclusive and potentially confounded by the strong association of both telomere length and risk of Alzheimer's disease with age and adverse lifestyle. To circumvent this, analyses including single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with telomere length used in an instrumental variable analysis produces risk estimates likely free of distortions from reverse causation and of most confounding. We tested the hypothesis that short telomeres are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, observationally and causal, genetically. Telomere length was measured in 66,567 individuals, and genotyped for rs2487999 in OBFC1, rs7726159 in TERT, and rs1317082 in TERC causing lifelong telomere shortening in 98,146 individuals from two Copenhagen studies. Genetic data on 54,162 individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project were also included. Observationally, multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio for Alzheimer's disease was 1.02 (95% CI 1.00-1.03) per 200 base pair shorter telomeres. Telomere length was 335 base pairs shorter in individuals with 6 versus 0-1 alleles (p = 5 × 10<sup>-105</sup>). Genetically, odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease was 1.08 (1.01-1.16) per 200 base pairs shorter telomeres. Similar results were found in strata of age and comorbidities. In comparative analyses, genetically predicted shorter telomeres were associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, and with decreased risks of lung cancer and melanoma as previously reported. Short telomeres were associated observationally and causal, genetically with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Telomere biology is therefore a potential pathway involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",Eur J Epidemiol,2019
39695808,Microglial CD2AP deficiency exerts protection in an Alzheimer's disease model of amyloidosis.,"BACKGROUND: The CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was initially identified in peripheral immune cells and regulates cytoskeleton and protein trafficking. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD2AP gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functional role of CD2AP, especially its role in microglia during AD onset, remains elusive.
METHODS: CD2AP protein levels in cultured primary cells and in 5xFAD mice was studied. Microglial CD2AP-deficient mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice and the offspring were subjected to neuropathological assessment, behavioral tests, electrophysiology, RNA-seq, Golgi staining, and biochemistry analysis. Primary microglia were also isolated for assessing their uptake and morphology changes.
RESULTS: We find that CD2AP is abundantly expressed in microglia and its levels are elevated in the brain of AD patients and the 5xFAD model mice at pathological stages. We demonstrate that CD2AP haploinsufficiency in microglia significantly attenuates cognitive and synaptic deficits, weakens the response of microglia to Aβ and the formation of disease-associated microglia (DAM), and alleviates synapse loss in 5xFAD mice. We show that CD2AP-deficient microglia exhibit compromised uptake ability. In addition, we find that CD2AP expression is positively correlated with the expression of the complement C1q that is important for synapse phagocytosis and the formation of DAM in response to Aβ deposition. Moreover, we reveal that CD2AP interacts with colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and regulates CSF1R cell surface levels, which may further affect C1q expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CD2AP regulates microgliosis and identify a protective function of microglial CD2AP deficiency against Aβ deposition, suggesting the importance of detailed investigation of AD-associated genes in different brain cells for thoroughly understanding their exact contribution to AD.",Mol Neurodegener,2024
26642089,Visualizing APP and BACE-1 approximation in neurons yields insight into the amyloidogenic pathway.,"Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE-1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1) is the rate-limiting step in amyloid-β (Aβ) production and a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; thus, physical approximation of this substrate-enzyme pair is a crucial event with broad biological and therapeutic implications. Despite much research, neuronal locales of APP and BACE-1 convergence and APP cleavage remain unclear. Here we report an optical assay, based on fluorescence complementation, for visualizing in cellulo APP-BACE-1 interactions as a simple on/off signal. Combining this with other assays tracking the fate of internalized APP in hippocampal neurons, we found that APP and BACE-1 interacted in both biosynthetic and endocytic compartments, particularly along recycling microdomains such as dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons. In axons, APP and BACE-1 were cotransported, and they also interacted during transit. Finally, our assay revealed that the Alzheimer's disease-protective 'Icelandic' mutation greatly attenuates APP-BACE-1 interactions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for protection. Collectively, the data challenge canonical models and provide concrete insights into long-standing controversies in the field.",Nat Neurosci,2016
38941473,Neural circuits expressing the serotonin 2C receptor regulate memory in mice and humans.,"Declined memory is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experiments in rodents and human postmortem studies suggest that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays a role in memory, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the role of 5-HT 2C receptor (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R) in regulating memory. Transgenic mice expressing a humanized HTR2C mutation exhibit impaired plasticity of hippocampal ventral CA1 (vCA1) neurons and reduced memory. Further, 5-HT neurons project to and synapse onto vCA1 neurons. Disruption of 5-HT synthesis in vCA1-projecting neurons or deletion of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs in the vCA1 impairs neural plasticity and memory. We show that a selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist, lorcaserin, improves synaptic plasticity and memory in an AD mouse model. Cumulatively, we demonstrate that hippocampal 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R signaling regulates memory, which may inform the use of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonists in the treatment of dementia.",Sci Adv,2024
29036819,Age and Graphomotor Decision Making Assessed with the Digital Clock Drawing Test: The Framingham Heart Study.,"BACKGROUND: Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) technology enables the examination of detailed neurocognitive behavior as behavior unfolds in real time; a capability that cannot be obtained using a traditional pen and paper testing format.
OBJECTIVE: Parameters obtained from the dCDT were used to investigate neurocognitive constructs related to higher-order neurocognitive decision making and information processing speed. The current research sought to determine the effect of age as related to combined motor and non-motor components of drawing, and higher-order decision making latencies.
METHODS: A large group of stroke- and dementia- free Framingham Heart Study participants were administered the dCDT to command and copy with hands set for ""10 after 11"". Six age groups (age range 28-98) were constructed.
RESULTS: Differences between age groups were found for total time to completion, total pen stroke count, and higher-order decision making latencies in both command and copy test conditions.
CONCLUSION: Longer age-related decision making latencies may reflect a greater need for working memory and increased self-monitoring in older subjects. These latency measures have potential to serve as neurocognitive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and other insidious neurodegenerative disorders.",J Alzheimers Dis,2017
34561430,Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) as a drug target for cardiovascular disease.,"Development of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors for coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to deliver licensed medicines. To distinguish compound from drug target failure, we compared evidence from clinical trials and drug target Mendelian randomization of CETP protein concentration, comparing this to Mendelian randomization of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). We show that previous failures of CETP inhibitors are likely compound related, as illustrated by significant degrees of between-compound heterogeneity in effects on lipids, blood pressure, and clinical outcomes observed in trials. On-target CETP inhibition, assessed through Mendelian randomization, is expected to reduce the risk of CHD, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, while increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration. In contrast, lower PCSK9 concentration is anticipated to decrease the risk of CHD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, while potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and asthma. Due to distinct effects on lipoprotein metabolite profiles, joint inhibition of CETP and PCSK9 may provide added benefit. In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence that CETP is an effective target for CHD prevention but with a potential on-target adverse effect on age-related macular degeneration.",Nat Commun,2021
28185568,Identification of expression patterns in the progression of disease stages by integration of transcriptomic data.,"BACKGROUND: In the study of complex diseases using genome-wide expression data from clinical samples, a difficult case is the identification and mapping of the gene signatures associated to the stages that occur in the progression of a disease. The stages usually correspond to different subtypes or classes of the disease, and the difficulty to identify them often comes from patient heterogeneity and sample variability that can hide the biomedical relevant changes that characterize each stage, making standard differential analysis inadequate or inefficient.
RESULTS: We propose a methodology to study diseases or disease stages ordered in a sequential manner (e.g. from early stages with good prognosis to more acute or serious stages associated to poor prognosis). The methodology is applied to diseases that have been studied obtaining genome-wide expression profiling of cohorts of patients at different stages. The approach allows searching for consistent expression patterns along the progression of the disease through two major steps: (i) identifying genes with increasing or decreasing trends in the progression of the disease; (ii) clustering the increasing/decreasing gene expression patterns using an unsupervised approach to reveal whether there are consistent patterns and find genes altered at specific disease stages. The first step is carried out using Gamma rank correlation to identify genes whose expression correlates with a categorical variable that represents the stages of the disease. The second step is done using a Self Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster the genes according to their progressive profiles and identify specific patterns. Both steps are done after normalization of the genomic data to allow the integration of multiple independent datasets. In order to validate the results and evaluate their consistency and biological relevance, the methodology is applied to datasets of three different diseases: myelodysplastic syndrome, colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. A software script written in R, named genediseasePatterns, is provided to allow the use and application of the methodology.
CONCLUSION: The method presented allows the analysis of the progression of complex and heterogeneous diseases that can be divided in pathological stages. It identifies gene groups whose expression patterns change along the advance of the disease, and it can be applied to different types of genomic data studying cohorts of patients in different states.",BMC Bioinformatics,2016
39688956,Statistical examination of shared loci in neuropsychiatric diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics.,"Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant 'local' genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter.",Elife,2024

26612516,G Protein-Gated K<sup>+</sup> Channel Ablation in Forebrain Pyramidal Neurons Selectively Impairs Fear Learning.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction occurs in many debilitating conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. The dorsal hippocampus is a critical locus of cognitive processes linked to spatial and contextual learning. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium ion (GIRK/Kir3) channels, which mediate the postsynaptic inhibitory effect of many neurotransmitters, have been implicated in hippocampal-dependent cognition. Available evidence, however, derives primarily from constitutive gain-of-function models that lack cellular specificity.
METHODS: We used constitutive and neuron-specific gene ablation models targeting an integral subunit of neuronal GIRK channels (GIRK2) to probe the impact of GIRK channels on associative learning and memory.
RESULTS: Constitutive Girk2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a striking deficit in hippocampal-dependent (contextual) and hippocampal-independent (cue) fear conditioning. Mice lacking GIRK2 in gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons (GAD-Cre:Girk2<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice) exhibited a clear deficit in GIRK-dependent signaling in dorsal hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons but no evident behavioral phenotype. Mice lacking GIRK2 in forebrain pyramidal neurons (CaMKII-Cre(+):Girk2<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice) exhibited diminished GIRK-dependent signaling in dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal pyramidal neurons. CaMKII-Cre(+):Girk2<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice also displayed a selective impairment in contextual fear conditioning, as both cue fear and spatial learning were intact in these mice. Finally, loss of GIRK2 in forebrain pyramidal neurons correlated with enhanced long-term depression and blunted depotentiation of long-term potentiation at the Schaffer collateral/cornu ammonis 1 synapse in the dorsal hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that GIRK channels in dorsal hippocampal pyramidal neurons are necessary for normal learning involving aversive stimuli and support the contention that dysregulation of GIRK-dependent signaling may underlie cognitive dysfunction in some disorders.",Biol Psychiatry,2016
36599749,Single-neuron whole genome sequencing identifies increased somatic mutation burden in Alzheimer's disease related genes.,"Accumulation of somatic mutations in human neurons is associated with aging and neurodegeneration. To shed light on the somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurons and get more insight into the role of somatic mutations in AD pathogenesis, we performed single-neuron whole genome sequencing to detect genome-wide somatic mutations (single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and Indels) in 96 single prefrontal cortex neurons from 8 AD patients and 8 elderly controls. We found that the mutational burden is ∼3000 somatic mutations per neuron genome in elderly subjects. AD patients have increased somatic mutation burden in AD-related annotation categories, including AD risk genes and differentially expressed genes in AD neurons. Mutational signature analysis showed somatic SNVs (sSNVs) primarily caused by aging and oxidative DNA damage processes but no significant difference was detected between AD and controls. Additionally, functional somatic mutations identified in AD patients showed significant enrichment in several AD-related pathways, including AD pathway, Notch-signaling pathway and Calcium-signaling pathway. These findings provide genetic insights into how somatic mutations may alter the function of single neurons and exert their potential roles in the pathogenesis of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2022

In this study, we investigated plasma p-tau181 as a biomarker of AD in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). We included 366 adults with DS (240 asymptomatic, 43 prodromal AD, 83 AD dementia) and 44 euploid cognitively normal controls. We measured plasma p-tau181 with a Single molecule array (Simoa) assay. We examined the diagnostic performance of p-tau181 for the detection of AD and the relationship with other fluid and imaging biomarkers. Plasma p-tau181 concentration showed an area under the curve of 0.80 [95% CI 0.73-0.87] and 0.92 [95% CI 0.89-0.95] for the discrimination between asymptomatic individuals versus those in the prodromal and dementia groups, respectively. Plasma p-tau181 correlated with atrophy and hypometabolism in temporoparietal regions. Our findings indicate that plasma p-tau181 concentration can be useful to detect AD in DS.",Nat Commun,2021

23255825,Naturally occurring α-synuclein autoantibody levels are lower in patients with Parkinson disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers are required for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in Parkinson disease (PD). To date, most studies have concentrated on α-synuclein (α-Syn), a protein involved in Parkinson disease pathogenesis, as a potential biomarker, with inconsistent outcomes. Recently, naturally occurring autoantibodies against α-Syn (α-Syn-nAbs) have been detected in the serum of patients with PD. They represent a putative diagnostic marker for PD.
METHODS: We established and validated an ELISA to quantify α-Syn-nAbs in serum samples. We analyzed serum samples from 62 patients with PD, 46 healthy controls (HC), and 42 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) using this newly established ELISA. Additionally, serum levels of endogenous α-Syn were measured.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in α-Syn-nAbs levels between the investigated groups (p = 0.005; Kruskal-Wallis test). Levels of α-Syn-nAbs were significantly lower in patients with PD compared to HC (p < 0.05; Dunn multiple comparison post hoc test) or patients with AD (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we detected no difference between patients with AD and HC. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for patients with PD vs. HC were 85% and 25%, respectively. The α-Syn-nAbs levels did not correlate with age, Hoehn & Yahr status, or duration of disease. Endogenous α-Syn had no influence on α-Syn-nAbs levels in sera.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a well-validated assay, we detected reduced α-Syn-nAbs levels in patients with PD compared to patients with AD and HC. The assay did not achieve criteria for use as a diagnostic tool to reliably distinguish PD from HC. Further studies are needed to assess α-Syn-nAbs as a biomarker in PD.",Neurology,2012
36543814,Sex and menopause impact <sup>31</sup>P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy brain mitochondrial function in association with <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET amyloid-beta load.,"Increasing evidence implicates sex and endocrine aging effects on brain bioenergetic aging in the greater lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women. We conducted <sup>31</sup>Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) to assess the impact of sex and menopause on brain high-energy phosphates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi)] and membrane phospholipids [phosphomonoesters/phosphodiesters (PME/PDE)] in 216 midlife cognitively normal individuals at risk for AD, 80% female. Ninety-seven participants completed amyloid-beta (Aβ) <sup>11</sup>C-PiB PET. Women exhibited higher ATP utilization than men in AD-vulnerable frontal, posterior cingulate, fusiform, medial and lateral temporal regions (p &lt; 0.001). This profile was evident in frontal cortex at the pre-menopausal and peri-menopausal stage and extended to the other regions at the post-menopausal stage (p = 0.001). Results were significant after multi-variable adjustment for age, APOE-4 status, midlife health indicators, history of hysterectomy/oophorectomy, use of menopause hormonal therapy, and total intracranial volume. While associations between ATP/PCr and Aβ load were not significant, individuals with the highest Aβ load were post-menopausal and peri-menopausal women with ATP/PCr ratios in the higher end of the distribution. No differences in Pi/PCr, Pi/ATP or PME/PDE were detected. Outcomes are consistent with dynamic bioenergetic brain adaptations that are associated with female sex and endocrine aging.",Sci Rep,2022
25383391,PARP1 gene variation and microglial activity on [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 PET in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation is one pathophysio-logical mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have identifiedan association between the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene and AD. This gene encodes a protein that is involved in many biological functions, including DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, and is a mediator of inflammation. Therefore, we performed a targeted genetic association analysis to investigate the relationship between the PARP1 polymorphisms and brain micro-glial activity as indexed by [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET). Participants were 26 non-Hispanic Caucasians in the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS). PET data were intensity-normalized by injected dose/total body weight. Average PBR standardized uptake values (SUV) from 6 bilateral regions of interest (thalamus, frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices, and whole brain gray matter) were used as endophenotypes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 20% minor allele frequency that were within +/- 20 kb of the PARP1 gene were included in the analyses. Gene-level association analyses were performed using a dominant genetic model with translocator protein (18-kDa) (TSPO) genotype, age at PET scan, and gender as covariates. Analyses were performed with and without APOE ε4 status as a covariate. Associations with PBR SUVs from thalamus and cingulate were significant at corrected p&lt;0.014 and &lt;0.065, respectively. Subsequent multi-marker analysis with cingulate PBR SUV showed that individuals with the ""C"" allele at rs6677172 and ""A"" allele at rs61835377 had higher PBR SUV than individuals without these alleles (corrected P&lt;0.03), and individuals with the ""G"" allele at rs6677172 and ""G"" allele at rs61835377 displayed the opposite trend (corrected P&lt;0.065). A previous study with the same cohort showed an inverse relationship between PBR SUV and brain atrophy at a follow-up visit, suggesting possible protective effect of microglial activity against cortical atrophy. Interestingly, all 6 AD and 2 of 3 LMCI participants in the current analysis had one or more copies of the ""GG"" allele combination, associated with lower cingulate PBR SUV, suggesting that this gene variant warrants further investigation.",Multimodal Brain Image Anal (2013),2013

EVs, and particularly a subset of EV known as exosomes, are emerging as key mediators of cell to cell communication and waste management for cells both during normal organismal function and in disease. In this review, we investigate the rapidly growing field of exosome biology, their biogenesis, cargo loading, and uptake by other cells. We particularly consider the role of exosomes in Alzheimer's disease, both as a pathogenic agent and as a disease biomarker. We also explore the emerging role of exosomes in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we highlight open questions in these fields and the possible use of exosomes as therapeutic targets and agents.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,2018

34681041,Association and Gene-Gene Interactions Study of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease in the Russian Population.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and represents the most common cause of dementia. In this study, we performed several different analyses to detect loci involved in development of the late onset AD in the Russian population. DNA samples from 472 unrelated subjects were genotyped for 63 SNPs using iPLEX Assay and real-time PCR. We identified five genetic loci that were significantly associated with LOAD risk for the Russian population (TOMM40 rs2075650, APOE rs429358 and rs769449, NECTIN rs6857, APOE ε4). The results of the analysis based on comparison of the haplotype frequencies showed two risk haplotypes and one protective haplotype. The GMDR analysis demonstrated three significant models as a result: a one-factor, a two-factor and a three-factor model. A protein-protein interaction network with three subnetworks was formed for the 24 proteins. Eight proteins with a large number of interactions are identified: APOE, SORL1, APOC1, CD33, CLU, TOMM40, CNTNAP2 and CACNA1C. The present study confirms the importance of the APOE-TOMM40 locus as the main risk locus of development and progress of LOAD in the Russian population. Association analysis and bioinformatics approaches detected interactions both at the association level of single SNPs and at the level of genes and proteins.",Genes (Basel),2021
31874606,Mild cognitive impairment understanding: an empirical study by data-driven approach.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline has emerged as a significant threat to both public health and personal welfare, and mild cognitive decline/impairment (MCI) can further develop into Dementia/Alzheimer's disease. While treatment of Dementia/Alzheimer's disease can be expensive and ineffective sometimes, the prevention of MCI by identifying modifiable risk factors is a complementary and effective strategy.
RESULTS: In this study, based on the data collected by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the nationwide telephone survey, we apply a data-driven approach to re-exam the previously founded risk factors and discover new risk factors. We found that depression, physical health, cigarette usage, education level, and sleep time play an important role in cognitive decline, which is consistent with the previous discovery. Besides that, the first time, we point out that other factors such as arthritis, pulmonary disease, stroke, asthma, marital status also contribute to MCI risk, which is less exploited previously. We also incorporate some machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh the importance of various factors contributed to MCI and predicted cognitive declined.
CONCLUSION: By incorporating the data-driven approach, we can determine that risk factors significantly correlated with diseases. These correlations could also be expanded to another medical diagnosis besides MCI.",BMC Bioinformatics,2019
30217936,An MRI measure of degenerative and cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To develop, replicate, and validate an MRI-based quantitative measure of both cerebrovascular and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD) for clinical and potentially research purposes.
METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional and longitudinal community-based study of Medicare-eligible residents in northern Manhattan followed every 18-24 months (n = 1,175, mean age 78 years). White matter hyperintensities, infarcts, hippocampal volumes, and cortical thicknesses were quantified from MRI and combined to generate an MRI measure associated with episodic memory. The combined MRI measure was replicated and validated using autopsy data, clinical diagnoses, and CSF biomarkers and amyloid PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
RESULTS: The quantitative MRI measure was developed in a group of community participants (n = 690) and replicated in a similar second group (n = 485). Compared with healthy controls, the quantitative MRI measure was lower in patients with mild cognitive impairment and lower still in those with clinically diagnosed AD. The quantitative MRI measure correlated with neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, atrophy, and infarcts at postmortem in an autopsy subset and was also associated with PET amyloid imaging and CSF levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau, and β-amyloid 42. The MRI measure predicted conversion to MCI and clinical AD among healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: We developed, replicated, and validated an MRI measure of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies that are associated with clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis of AD and related to established biomarkers.",Neurology,2018
39686610,Factors influencing rates of unsupervised assessment of short-term learning in cognitively unimpaired adults.,"BACKGROUND: In older adults with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), learning curves derived from validated psychological learning paradigms are reduced to an extent greater than impairment, or decline, on neuropsychological memory tests.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine how age, sex, education, mood, and general dementia risk, which also increases risk for preclinical AD, could influence learning curves.
METHODS: 1050 adults enrolled in the BetterBrains trial completed 10 blocks of ORCA-LLT learning trials over 5 days. Learning curves were derived from improvement in accuracy over trials. Participants also completed questionnaires of demography and mood, and the CAIDE risk score was computed for each participant.
RESULTS: Most participants (67%) completed ≥6 blocks of ORCA-LLT. Older age (d = 0.75), lower education (d = 0.50), and higher dementia risk (d = 0.36) were associated significantly with slower learning rates.
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, learning curves are influenced subtly by age, education, and dementia risk but not by sex or mood.",J Alzheimers Dis,2024
25443857,The Centiloid Project: standardizing quantitative amyloid plaque estimation by PET.,"Although amyloid imaging with PiB-PET ([C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography), and now with F-18-labeled tracers, has produced remarkably consistent qualitative findings across a large number of centers, there has been considerable variability in the exact numbers reported as quantitative outcome measures of tracer retention. In some cases this is as trivial as the choice of units, in some cases it is scanner dependent, and of course, different tracers yield different numbers. Our working group was formed to standardize quantitative amyloid imaging measures by scaling the outcome of each particular analysis method or tracer to a 0 to 100 scale, anchored by young controls (≤ 45 years) and typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The units of this scale have been named ""Centiloids."" Basically, we describe a ""standard"" method of analyzing PiB PET data and then a method for scaling any ""nonstandard"" method of PiB PET analysis (or any other tracer) to the Centiloid scale.",Alzheimers Dement,2014
36739619,Neural atrophy produced by AAV tau injections into hippocampus and anterior cortex of middle-aged mice.,"Animal models of tauopathy help in understanding the role of mutations in tau pathobiology. Here, we used adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to administer three tau genetic variants (tau<sup>wild-type</sup>, tau<sup>P301L</sup>, and tau<sup>R406W</sup>) intracranially into 12-month-old C57BL/6Nia mice and collected tissue at 16 months. Vectors designed to express green fluorescent protein controlled for surgical procedures and exogenous protein expression by AAV. The tau genetic variants produced considerably different phenotypes. Tau<sup>wild-type</sup> and tau<sup>P301L</sup> caused memory impairments. The tau<sup>P301L</sup> caused increased amounts of aggregated tau, measured both neurochemically and histologically. Tau<sup>wild-type</sup> produced elevated levels of soluble tau and phosphorylated tau by ELISA and increased staining for phosphorylated forms of tau histologically. However, only the tau<sup>wild-type</sup> caused localized atrophy of brain tissue at the sites near the injection. The tau<sup>R406W</sup> had low protein expression and produced no atrophy or memory impairments. This supports the potential use of AAV expressing tau<sup>wild-type</sup> in aged mice to examine events leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease pathology.",Neurobiol Aging,2022
31504240,CSF1R inhibitor JNJ-40346527 attenuates microglial proliferation and neurodegeneration in P301S mice.,"Neuroinflammation and microglial activation are significant processes in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Recent genome-wide association studies have highlighted multiple immune-related genes in association with Alzheimer's disease, and experimental data have demonstrated microglial proliferation as a significant component of the neuropathology. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the selective CSF1R inhibitor JNJ-40346527 (JNJ-527) in the P301S mouse tauopathy model. We first demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of JNJ-527 on microglia in the ME7 prion model, and its impact on the inflammatory profile, and provided potential CNS biomarkers for clinical investigation with the compound, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and efficacy assessment by TSPO autoradiography and CSF proteomics. Then, we showed for the first time that blockade of microglial proliferation and modification of microglial phenotype leads to an attenuation of tau-induced neurodegeneration and results in functional improvement in P301S mice. Overall, this work strongly supports the potential for inhibition of CSF1R as a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.",Brain,2019
30422173,Association of Apolipoprotein E ε4 With Transactive Response DNA-Binding Protein 43.,"IMPORTANCE: Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is strongly associated with β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and risk of AD, but its association with TDP-43 is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the APOE ε4 allele is a risk factor for TDP-43.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, genetic-histologic study analyzed APOE genotype, TDP-43 status (positive vs negative), Aβ status (positive vs negative), and tau neurofibrillary tangle stage (B0, Braak stage 0; B1, Braak stages I-II; B2, Braak stages III-IV; B3, Braak stage ≥ V). We fit structural equation models to map the association between APOE and TDP-43, Aβ, and tau, accounting for age and hippocampal sclerosis. We identified 751 participants with an AD pathological spectrum diagnosis and completed Aβ, tau, and TDP-43 data who were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry, or the population based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and died between May 12, 1999, and December 31, 2015. However, 13 were excluded from the analyses because of missing APOE data, leaving a total of 738 participants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 was the main outcome of interest. We hypothesized that the APOE ε4 allele would be significantly directly and indirectly associated with TDP-43.
RESULTS: The 751 study participants were older (median age [interquartile range], 87 years [51-105 years]), 395 (54%) were women, and 324 (44%) were APOE ε4 carriers. The patients died between May 12, 1999, and December 31, 2015. Accounting for age, Aβ, and tau, APOE ε4 had a direct association with TDP-43 (estimate [SE], 0.31 (0.11); P = .01). The association was present among individuals with an intermediate to high likelihood of having AD (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2/B3; n = 604 [81.8%]; estimate [SE], 0.51 [0.11]; P < .001), with a similar trend for those with a low likelihood of having AD (B1; n = 134 [18.2%]; estimate [SE], 0.54 [0.32]; P = .10). We also found an indirect association of APOE ε4 with TDP-43 via Aβ and tau (estimate [SE], 0.34 [0.06]; P < .001), which was similar in magnitude to the direct association and an indirect association of APOE ε4 with hippocampal sclerosis via TDP-43 (estimate [SE], 0.65 [0.26]; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study's findings, which mapped a system of risk factors and outcomes, showed that the APOE ε4 allele appears to be a risk factor for TDP-43 independently of Aβ in patients with AD.",JAMA Neurol,2018
33074241,Antivirals Against SARS-CoV2: Relevance to the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,"A recent study in vitro has shown that a sulphated polysaccharide, a type of fucoidan, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-Cov2. If the antiviral action were successful also for COVID-19 patients, it would be enormously valuable against not only acute disease but also long-term mental effects, which might include Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a trial of AD patients, the apparent success of treatment with a polysaccharide, GV971, was suggested to result from antiviral action against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) in brain, a pathogen strongly implicated in AD, and that sulphation of GV971, making it fucoidan-like, might increase its putative antiviral action. These data indicate that treatment of AD patients might be very effective using valacyclovir, a conventional antiviral, which inhibits viral replication, together with a fucoidan, which blocks virus entry into cells.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
33370284,The protective mutation A673T in amyloid precursor protein gene decreases Aβ peptides production for 14 forms of Familial Alzheimer's Disease in SH-SY5Y cells.,"The deposition of Aβ plaques in the brain leads to the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease. The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by α-secretase (non-amyloidogenic processing of APP), however increased cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) leads to the accumulation of Aβ peptides, which forms plaques. APP mutations mapping to exons 16 and 17 favor plaque accumulation and cause Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). However, a variant of the APP gene (A673T) originally found in an Icelandic population reduces BACE1 cleavage by 40%. A series of plasmids containing the APP gene, each with one of 29 different FAD mutations mapping to exon 16 and exon 17 was created. These plasmids were then replicated with the addition of the A673T mutation. Combined these formed the library of plasmids that was used in this study. The plasmids were transfected in neuroblastomas to assess the effect of this mutation on Aβ peptide production. The production of Aβ peptides was decreased for some FAD mutations due to the presence of the co-dominant A673T mutation. The reduction of Aβ peptide concentrations for the London mutation (V717I) even reached the same level as for A673T control in SH-SY5Y cells. These preliminary results suggest that the insertion of A673T in APP genes containing FAD mutations might confer a clinical benefit in preventing or delaying the onset of some FADs.",PLoS One,2020
36245378,"Association of Kidney Function with Risk of Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study of 275,167 UK Biobank Participants.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether CKD is a risk factor for dementia and compare the performance of different measures of calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
METHODS: 275,167 participants from UK Biobank were included and eGFR at baseline was calculated using serum creatinine (eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), and creatinine-cystatin C equations (eGFRcr-cys). Restricted cubic splines and Cox regression models were performed to assess the relationship of eGFR with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD).
RESULTS: We observed a U-shaped relationship between each eGFR and risk of all-cause dementia and VaD, with eGFRcys and eGFRcr-cys showing a closer linkage (peGFRcys <0.0001, peGFRcrhboxcys<0.0001 and peGFRcr = 0.0001). Lower and supranormal eGFR were related to increased risk of all-cause dementia. Compared to the reference category of 90-104 ml/min/1.73 m2, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause dementia for eGFRcr-cys 30-59, <30, and ≥105 ml/min/1.73 m2 were 1.26 (95% CI [1.05-1.50], p = 0.012), 2.62 (95% CI [1.54-4.47], p < 0.001), and 1.41 (95% CI [1.17-1.70], p < 0.001). No statistically significant association was observed between eGFR with risk of AD.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study identified impaired kidney function as a critical risk factor for dementia and noted the application of cystatin C strengthened the relationship between CKD and dementia, underlining the significant value of preserving kidney function to reduce the risk of dementia and considering cystatin C measurement as part of clinical practice.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022
36346209,High-frequency oscillations (250-500 Hz) in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and two animal models of epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 250 and 500 Hz occur in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus are not unique to epilepsy.
METHODS: Experiments were conducted in three mouse models of AD: Tg2576 mice that simulate a form of familial AD, presenilin 2 knock-out (PS2KO) mice, and the Ts65Dn model of Down's syndrome. We recorded HFOs using wideband (0.1-500 Hz, 2 kHz) intra-hippocampal and cortical surface electroencephalography (EEG) at 1 month until 24 months of age during wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, interictal spikes (IISs) and seizures were analyzed for the possible presence of HFOs. Comparisons were made to the intra-hippocampal kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epilepsy.
RESULTS: We describe for the first time that hippocampal and cortical HFOs are a new EEG abnormality in AD mouse models. HFOs occurred in all transgenic mice but no controls. They were also detectable as early as 1 month of age and prior to amyloid beta plaque neuropathology. HFOs were most frequent during SWS (vs REM sleep or wakefulness). Notably, HFOs in the AD and epilepsy models were indistinguishable in both spectral frequency and duration. HFOs also occurred during IISs and seizures in the AD models, although with altered spectral properties compared to isolated HFOs.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that HFOs, an epilepsy biomarker with high translational value, are not unique to epilepsy and thus not disease specific. Our findings also strengthen the idea of hyperexcitability in AD and its significant overlap with epilepsy. HFOs in AD mouse models may serve as an EEG biomarker, which is detectable from the scalp and thus amenable to noninvasive detection in people at risk for AD.",Epilepsia,2022
37925995,Associations between recall of proper names in story recall and CSF amyloid and tau in adults without cognitive impairment.,"Neuropsychological measures sensitive to decline in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease are needed. We previously demonstrated that higher amyloid-beta (Aβ) assessed by positron emission tomography in adults without cognitive impairment was associated with recall of fewer proper names in Logical Memory story recall. The current study investigated the association between proper names and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>, phosphorylated tau<sub>181</sub> [pTau<sub>181</sub>], neurofilament light) in 223 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. We assessed associations between biomarkers and delayed Logical Memory total score and proper names using binary logistic regressions. Sensitivity analyses used multinomial logistic regression and stratified biomarker groups. Lower Logical Memory total score and proper names scores from the most recent visit were associated with biomarker positivity. Relatedly, there was a 27% decreased risk of being classified Aβ<sub>42/40</sub>+/pTau<sub>181</sub>+ for each additional proper name recalled. A linear mixed effects model found that longitudinal change in proper names recall was predicted by biomarker status. These results demonstrate a novel relationship between proper names and Alzheimer's disease-cerebrospinal fluid pathology.",Neurobiol Aging,2023
28660589,On Electrochemical Methods for Determination of Protein-Lipid Interaction.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are important and reliable molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. Aggregation and fibrillization of Aβ peptides on ganglioside GM1 (GM1)-containing lipid membranes is considered a cause of neurodegenerative disease. Because GM1 is abundant in the central nervous system and plays a key role in the aggregation of Aβ, the interaction of Aβ with supported planar lipid bilayers (SPBs) containing GM1 is of great significance. We have prepared SPBs containing GM1 in order to study the electrochemical characteristics of GM1/sphingomyelin/cholesterol SPBs and their interaction with Aβ(1-40) by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which proves that electrochemical is a promising method for analyzing the interaction between peptides and lipid membranes.",Methods Mol Biol,2017
34635189,Anatomic survey of seeding in Alzheimer's disease brains reveals unexpected patterns.,"Tauopathies are heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases defined by progressive brain accumulation of tau aggregates. The most common tauopathy, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), involves progressive tau deposition that can be divided into specific stages of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. This classification is consistent with experimental data which suggests that network-based propagation is mediated by cell-cell transfer of tau ""seeds"", or assemblies, that serve as templates for their own replication. Until now, seeding assays of AD brain have largely been limited to areas previously defined by NFT pathology. We now expand this work to additional regions. We selected 20 individuals with AD pathology of NFT stages I, III, and V. We stained and classified 25 brain regions in each using the anti-phospho-tau monoclonal antibody AT8. We measured tau seeding in each of the 500 samples using a cell-based tau ""biosensor"" assay in which induction of intracellular tau aggregation is mediated by exogenous tau assemblies. We observed a progressive increase in tau seeding according to NFT stage. Seeding frequently preceded NFT pathology, e.g., in the basolateral subnucleus of the amygdala and the substantia nigra, pars compacta. We observed seeding in brain regions not previously known to develop tau pathology, e.g., the globus pallidus and internal capsule, where AT8 staining revealed mainly axonal accumulation of tau. AT8 staining in brain regions identified because of tau seeding also revealed pathology in a previously undescribed cell type: Bergmann glia of the cerebellar cortex. We also detected tau seeding in brain regions not previously examined, e.g., the intermediate reticular zone, dorsal raphe nucleus, amygdala, basal nucleus of Meynert, and olfactory bulb. In conclusion, tau histopathology and seeding are complementary analytical tools. Tau seeding assays reveal pathology in the absence of AT8 signal in some instances, and previously unrecognized sites of tau deposition. The variation in sites of seeding between individuals could underlie differences in the clinical presentation and course of AD.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,2021
32985496,Global quantitative analysis of the human brain proteome and phosphoproteome in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an early, asymptomatic phase (AsymAD) in which individuals exhibit amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation in the absence of clinically detectable cognitive decline. Here we report an unbiased multiplex quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis using tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling of human post-mortem cortex (n = 27) across pathology-free controls, AsymAD and symptomatic AD individuals. With off-line high-pH fractionation and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer, we identified 11,378 protein groups across three TMT 11-plex batches. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to enrich for phosphopeptides from the same TMT-labeled cases and 51,736 phosphopeptides were identified. Of these, 48,992 were quantified by TMT reporter ions representing 33,652 unique phosphosites. Two reference standards in each TMT 11-plex were included to assess intra- and inter-batch variance at the protein and peptide level. This comprehensive human brain proteome and phosphoproteome dataset will serve as a valuable resource for the identification of biochemical, cellular and signaling pathways altered during AD progression.",Sci Data,2020
28092683,Case-control association mapping by proxy using family history of disease.,"Collecting cases for case-control genetic association studies can be time-consuming and expensive. In some situations (such as studies of late-onset or rapidly lethal diseases), it may be more practical to identify family members of cases. In randomly ascertained cohorts, replacing cases with their first-degree relatives enables studies of diseases that are absent (or nearly absent) in the cohort. We refer to this approach as genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX) and apply it to 12 common diseases in 116,196 individuals from the UK Biobank. Meta-analysis with published genome-wide association study summary statistics replicated established risk loci and yielded four newly associated loci for Alzheimer's disease, eight for coronary artery disease and five for type 2 diabetes. In addition to informing disease biology, our results demonstrate the utility of association mapping without directly observing cases. We anticipate that GWAX will prove useful in future genetic studies of complex traits in large population cohorts.",Nat Genet,2017
39251807,Genome-wide association study meta-analysis of neurofilament light (NfL) levels in blood reveals novel loci related to neurodegeneration.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in circulation have been established as a sensitive biomarker of neuro-axonal damage across a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Elucidation of the genetic architecture of blood NfL levels could provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. In this meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of blood NfL levels from eleven cohorts of European ancestry, we identify two genome-wide significant loci at 16p12 (UMOD) and 17q24 (SLC39A11). We observe association of three loci at 1q43 (FMN2), 12q14, and 12q21 with blood NfL levels in the meta-analysis of African-American ancestry. In the trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we identify three additional genome-wide significant loci at 1p32 (FGGY), 6q14 (TBX18), and 4q21. In the post-GWAS analyses, we observe the association of higher NfL polygenic risk score with increased plasma levels of total-tau, Aβ-40, Aβ-42, and higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the Rotterdam Study. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest that a lower kidney function could cause higher blood NfL levels. This study uncovers multiple genetic loci of blood NfL levels, highlighting the genes related to molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration.",Commun Biol,2024
28341065,Recommendations for CSF AD biomarkers in the diagnostic evaluation of dementia.,"This article presents recommendations, based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method, for the clinical application of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub>, tau, and phosphorylated tau in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with dementia. The recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary working group based on the available evidence and consensus from focused discussions for (i) identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the cause of dementia, (ii) prediction of rate of decline, (iii) cost-effectiveness, and (iv) interpretation of results. The working group found sufficient evidence to support a recommendation to use CSF AD biomarkers as a supplement to clinical evaluation, particularly in uncertain and atypical cases, to identify or exclude AD as the cause of dementia. Because of insufficient evidence, it was uncertain whether CSF AD biomarkers outperform imaging biomarkers. Operational recommendations for the interpretation of ambiguous CSF biomarker results were also provided.",Alzheimers Dement,2016
29632177,β-Amyloid accumulation in the human brain after one night of sleep deprivation.,"The effects of acute sleep deprivation on β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance in the human brain have not been documented. Here we used PET and <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben to measure brain Aβ burden (ABB) in 20 healthy controls tested after a night of rested sleep (baseline) and after a night of sleep deprivation. We show that one night of sleep deprivation, relative to baseline, resulted in a significant increase in Aβ burden in the right hippocampus and thalamus. These increases were associated with mood worsening following sleep deprivation, but were not related to the genetic risk (APOE genotype) for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, baseline ABB in a range of subcortical regions and the precuneus was inversely associated with reported night sleep hours. APOE genotyping was also linked to subcortical ABB, suggesting that different Alzheimer's disease risk factors might independently affect ABB in nearby brain regions. In summary, our findings show adverse effects of one-night sleep deprivation on brain ABB and expand on prior findings of higher Aβ accumulation with chronic less sleep.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2018
39764140,Targeting NLRP3 signaling with a novel sulfonylurea compound for the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia.,"BACKGROUND: As a key inflammatory factor, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of NLRP3 signaling can trigger various inflammatory responses in the brain, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke, vascular dementia (VaD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the NLRP3 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including VaD.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a synthetic sulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, in a VaD mouse model using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. All mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, VaD + Vehicle, and VaD + AMS-17. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) on the 50<sup>th</sup> day after BCAS. Brain sections and blood serum samples were collected for biomarker analysis and immunohistochemistry. Neurodegeneration, expressions of the molecules involved in the NLRP3 signaling pathways, tight junction proteins, and myelination were assessed using western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). The levels of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the blood were measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: AMS-17 treatment improved cognitive function, enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and promoted remyelination in VaD mice. Additionally, AMS-17 reduced neurodegeneration and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and its associated proteins, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cleaved caspase-1 in the brain. It also lowered pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels, while increasing the anti-inflammatory IL-4 level in the blood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide the first promising evidence for the use of AMS-17 in VaD treatment in mice. This study introduces AMS-17 as a novel chemical scaffold with NLRP3 inhibitory activity, which can be further developed for the treatment of VaD in humans.",Res Sq,2024
36335579,"Fragmentation of rest periods, astrocyte activation, and cognitive decline in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Sleep disruption is associated with astrocyte activation and impaired cognition in model organisms. However, the relationship among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition in humans is uncertain.
METHODS: We used RNA-seq to quantify the prefrontal cortex expression of a panel of human activated astrocyte marker genes in 1076 older adults in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, 411 of whom had multi-day actigraphy prior to death. We related this to rest fragmentation, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, and to longitudinal cognitive function.
RESULTS: Fragmentation of rest periods was associated with higher expression of activated astrocyte marker genes, which was associated with a lower level and faster decline of cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Astrocyte activation and fragmented rest are associated with each other and with accelerated cognitive decline. If experimental studies confirm a causal relationship, targeting sleep fragmentation and astrocyte activation may benefit cognition in older adults.
HIGHLIGHTS: Greater fragmentation of rest periods, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, is associated with higher composite expression of a panel of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes. Increased expression of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes was associated with a lower level and more rapid decline of cognitive function, beyond that accounted for by the burden of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to delineate the causal relationships among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition.",Alzheimers Dement,2022
30560948,Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in the absence of Presenilin 1 and Presenilin 2.,"Mutations in the presenilin genes (PS1 and PS2) are a major cause of familial-Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Presenilins regulate neurogenesis in the developing brain, with loss of PS1 inducing aberrant premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and additional loss of PS2 exacerbating this effect. It is unclear, however, whether presenilins are involved in adult neurogenesis, a process that may be impaired in Alzheimer's disease within the hippocampus. To investigate the requirement of presenilins in adult-generated dentate granule neurons, we examined adult neurogenesis in the PS2-/- adult brain and then employ a retroviral approach to ablate PS1 selectively in dividing progenitor cells of the PS2-/- adult brain. Surprisingly, the in vivo ablation of both presenilins resulted in no defects in the survival and differentiation of adult-generated neurons. There was also no change in the morphology or functional properties of the retroviral-labeled presenilin-null cells, as assessed by dendritic morphology and whole-cell electrophysiology analyses. Furthermore, while FACS analysis showed that stem and progenitor cells express presenilins, inactivation of presenilins from these cells, using a NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup> inducible genetic approach, demonstrated no changes in the proliferation, survival, or differentiation of adult-generated cells. Therefore, unlike their significant role in neurogenesis during embryonic development, presenilins are not required for cell-intrinsic regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",Sci Rep,2018
32677173,Leveraging existing GWAS summary data of genetically correlated and uncorrelated traits to improve power for a new GWAS.,"In spite of the tremendous success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying genetic variants associated with complex traits and common diseases, many more are yet to be discovered. Hence, it is always desirable to improve the statistical power of GWAS. Paralleling with the intensive efforts of integrating GWAS with functional annotations or other omic data, we propose leveraging other published GWAS summary data to boost statistical power for a new/focus GWAS; the traits of the published GWAS may or may not be genetically correlated with the target trait of the new GWAS. Building on weighted hypothesis testing with a solid theoretical foundation, we develop a novel and effective method to construct single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific weights based on 22 published GWAS data sets with various traits, detecting sometimes dramatically increased numbers of significant SNPs and independent loci as compared to the standard/unweighted analysis. For example, by integrating a schizophrenia GWAS summary data set with 19 other GWAS summary data sets of nonschizophrenia traits, our new method identified 1,585 genome-wide significant SNPs mapping to 15 linkage disequilibrium-independent loci, largely exceeding 818 significant SNPs in 13 independent loci identified by the standard/unweighted analysis; furthermore, using a later and larger schizophrenia GWAS summary data set as the validation data, 1,423 (out of 1,585) significant SNPs identified by the weighted analysis, compared to 705 (out of 818) by the unweighted analysis, were confirmed, while all 15 and 13 independent loci were also confirmed. Similar conclusions were reached with lipids and Alzheimer's disease (AD) traits. We conclude that the proposed approach is simple and cost-effective to improve GWAS power.",Genet Epidemiol,2020
37895194,"INPP5D/SHIP1: Expression, Regulation and Roles in Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for approximately 38.5 million cases of all-cause dementia. Over 60% of these individuals live in low- and middle-income countries and are the worst affected, especially by its deleterious effects on the productivity of both patients and caregivers. Numerous risk factors for the disease have been identified and our understanding of gene-environment interactions have shed light on several gene variants that contribute to the most common, sporadic form of AD. Microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have long been established as guardians of the brain by providing neuroprotection and maintaining cellular homeostasis. A protein with a myriad of effects on various important signaling pathways that is expressed in microglia is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing Inositol 5' Phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein. Encoded by the INPP5D (Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase D) gene, SHIP1 has diminutive effects on most microglia signaling processes. Polymorphisms of the INPP5D gene have been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. Several studies have elucidated mechanistic processes by which SHIP1 exerts its perturbations on signaling processes in peripheral immune cells. However, current knowledge of the controllers of INPP5D/SHIP1 expression and the idiosyncrasies of its influences on signaling processes in microglia and their relevance to AD pathophysiology is limited. In this review, we summarize these discoveries and discuss the potential of leveraging INPP5D/SHIP1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",Genes (Basel),2023
35473418,Mediators of cognitive impairment in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with cognitive decline. CAA has diverse impacts on brain structure and function; however, the brain lesions that mediate the association of CAA with cognition are not understood well.
AIMS: To determine the degree to which CAA neuroimaging biomarkers mediate the association of CAA with cognitive dysfunction.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data of patients with probable CAA and controls without cognitive impairment from the Functional Assessment of Vascular Reactivity study. Neuropsychological tests were grouped into domains of memory, executive function, and processing speed. Candidate CAA neuroimaging biomarkers were pre-specified based on prior literature, consisting of white matter hyperintensity volume, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), cortical thickness, and cortical thickness in a meta-region of interest typically affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive scores and neuroimaging markers were standardized and reported in relation to values in controls. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the total effect of CAA on cognition and the proportion of the total effect that was mediated by neuroimaging biomarkers, controlling for age, sex, and education.
RESULTS: There were 131 participants (67 CAA and 64 controls). Mean age was 72.1 ± 7.7 years, and 54.2% were women. As expected, compared to controls, CAA was associated with lower cognition. In mediation analyses, CAA had direct unmediated effects of 48%, 46%, and 52% on all three cognitive domains. The association of CAA with memory was partially mediated by CVR and PSMD, accounting for 18% and 36% of the total effect of CAA. The association of CAA with executive function was partially mediated by PSMD and mean cortical thickness in the AD meta-region of interest (ROI), accounting for 33% and 31% of the total effect of CAA. The association of CAA with processing speed was partially mediated by CVR and PSMD, accounting for 8% and 34% of the total effect of CAA. Among CAA participants, the presence of cortical superficial siderosis was associated with lower processing speed.
CONCLUSION: Altered white matter diffusivity (i.e. PSMD), CVR, and atrophy, taken together, account for about half the effect of CAA on cognition.",Int J Stroke,2023
34381170,Identification of novel drug targets for Alzheimer's disease by integrating genetics and proteomes from brain and blood.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered numerous risk genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how these genes confer AD risk is challenging to decipher. To efficiently transform genetic associations into drug targets for AD, we employed an integrative analytical pipeline using proteomes in the brain and blood by systematically applying proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization. Collectively, we identified the brain protein abundance of 7 genes (ACE, ICA1L, TOM1L2, SNX32, EPHX2, CTSH, and RTFDC1) are causal in AD (P < 0.05/proteins identified for PWAS and MR; PPH4 >80% for Bayesian colocalization). The proteins encoded by these genes were mainly expressed on the surface of glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes. Of them, ACE with its protein abundance was also identified in significant association with AD on the blood-based studies and showed significance at the transcriptomic level. SNX32 was also found to be associated with AD at the blood transcriptomic level. Collectively, our current study results on genetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic approaches has identified compelling genes, which may provide important leads to design future functional studies and potential drug targets for AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2021
29028963,ZCCHC17 is a master regulator of synaptic gene expression in Alzheimer's disease.,"MOTIVATION: In an effort to better understand the molecular drivers of synaptic and neurophysiologic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we analyzed neuronal gene expression data from human AD brain tissue to identify master regulators of synaptic gene expression.
RESULTS: Master regulator analysis identifies ZCCHC17 as normally supporting the expression of a network of synaptic genes, and predicts that ZCCHC17 dysfunction in AD leads to lower expression of these genes. We demonstrate that ZCCHC17 is normally expressed in neurons and is reduced early in the course of AD pathology. We show that ZCCHC17 loss in rat neurons leads to lower expression of the majority of the predicted synaptic targets and that ZCCHC17 drives the expression of a similar gene network in humans and rats. These findings support a conserved function for ZCCHC17 between species and identify ZCCHC17 loss as an important early driver of lower synaptic gene expression in AD.

27440727,Imaging synaptic density in the living human brain.,"Chemical synapses are the predominant neuron-to-neuron contact in the central nervous system. Presynaptic boutons of neurons contain hundreds of vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, the diffusible signaling chemicals. Changes in the number of synapses are associated with numerous brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. However, all current approaches for measuring synaptic density in humans require brain tissue from autopsy or surgical resection. We report the use of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [(11)C]UCB-J combined with positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify synaptic density in the living human brain. Validation studies in a baboon confirmed that SV2A is an alternative synaptic density marker to synaptophysin. First-in-human PET studies demonstrated that [(11)C]UCB-J had excellent imaging properties. Finally, we confirmed that PET imaging of SV2A was sensitive to synaptic loss in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, [(11)C]UCB-J PET imaging is a promising approach for in vivo quantification of synaptic density with several potential applications in diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Sci Transl Med,2016

34568539,Routine magnetoencephalography in memory clinic patients: A machine learning approach.,"INTRODUCTION: We report the routine application of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a memory clinic, and its value in the discrimination of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from controls.
METHODS: Three hundred sixty-six patients visiting our memory clinic underwent MEG recording. Source-reconstructed MEG data were visually assessed and evaluated in the context of clinical findings and other diagnostic markers. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of MEG spectral measures in the discrimination of individual AD dementia patients (n = 40) from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients (n = 40) using random forest models.
RESULTS: Best discrimination was obtained using a combination of relative theta and delta power (accuracy 0.846, sensitivity 0.855, specificity 0.837). The results were validated in an independent cohort. Hippocampal and thalamic regions, besides temporal-occipital lobes, contributed considerably to the model.
DISCUSSION: MEG has been implemented successfully in the workup of memory clinic patients and has value in diagnostic decision-making.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
30617256,Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD.",Nat Genet,2019
35702342,Effect of Time to Detection on the Measured Concentrations of Blood Proteins Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: For assays using immunomagnetic reduction, a reagent composed of antibody-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles is dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline solution. The real-time signals of alternating-current (ac) magnetic susceptibility, χ<sub>ac</sub>, of the reagent are subsequently recorded after mixing the reagent with a biofluid sample. After mixing the reagent and sample, the reduction in χ<sub>ac</sub> of the mixture is calculated and used to quantify the concentration of the target biomarker in the sample. The reduction does not occur immediately but rather occurs at some time after mixing. This observation implies that the time elapsed before recording the real-time signals of χ<sub>ac</sub> of a reagent-sample mixture needs to be investigated to ensure that the signals are fully recorded. In this work, the effect of time to detection on the measured concentrations of proteins in human plasma after mixing the reagent and sample is examined.
METHODS: The proteins analyzed are related to Alzheimer's disease: amyloid β 1-40, amyloid β 1-42, and Tau protein. The investigated times to detection after the mixing the reagent and sample are 0, 20, 30, 40, and 120 min.
RESULTS: The results show that the recording of real-time signals of χ<sub>ac</sub> should be conducted within 20 min after mixing the reagent and sample.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra,2022
25376662,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and essential tremor.,"BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be inversely related to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, both of which may share common mechanisms with essential tremor (ET). Use of these medications has not been studied in ET cases vs. controls.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between NSAID (esp. ibuprofen) and aspirin use and ET.
METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in a case-control study of the environmental epidemiology of ET at the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC; 2009-2014). We compared 92 ET cases to 107 controls (∼1:1 matching) in terms of self-reported NSAID (esp. ibuprofen) and aspirin use.
RESULTS: The proportion of NSAID or aspirin users (current or past) was similar in ET cases and controls (for current user, p = 0.66; for past user, p = 0.90). Among users, however, the total dosage of ibuprofen (frequency in past year × number of tablets taken at a time × typical average strength of tablets) was higher in controls than ET cases (p = 0.04). ET cases and controls did not differ with respect to aspirin use in the past year.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of NSAID or aspirin users did not differ in ET cases or controls; yet interestingly, ibuprofen use was less in ET cases than in controls. The latter raises the possibility that ibuprofen use could have a potential protective role in ET.",Neuroepidemiology,2014
31695027,Molecular basis for chirality-regulated Aβ self-assembly and receptor recognition revealed by ion mobility-mass spectrometry.,"Despite extensive efforts on probing the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enormous investments into AD drug development, the lack of effective disease-modifying therapeutics and the complexity of the AD pathogenesis process suggest a great need for further insights into alternative AD drug targets. Herein, we focus on the chiral effects of truncated amyloid beta (Aβ) and offer further structural and molecular evidence for epitope region-specific, chirality-regulated Aβ fragment self-assembly and its potential impact on receptor-recognition. A multidimensional ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) analytical platform and in-solution kinetics analysis reveal the comprehensive structural and molecular basis for differential Aβ fragment chiral chemistry, including the differential and cooperative roles of chiral Aβ N-terminal and C-terminal fragments in receptor recognition. Our method is applicable to many other systems and the results may shed light on the potential development of novel AD therapeutic strategies based on targeting the D-isomerized Aβ, rather than natural L-Aβ.",Nat Commun,2019
34875506,Expression and proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein is unaffected by the expression of the three human apolipoprotein E alleles in the brains of mice.,"The 3 human apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene alleles modify an individual's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD): compared to the risk-neutral APOE ε3 allele, the ε4 allele (APOE4) is strongly associated with increased AD risk while the ε2 allele is protective. Multiple mechanisms have been shown to link APOE4 expression and AD risk, including the possibility that APOE4 increases the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Y-W.A. Huang, B. Zhou, A.M. Nabet, M. Wernig, T.C. Südhof, 2019). In this study, we investigated the impact of APOE genotype on the expression, and proteolytic processing of endogenously expressed APP in the brains of mice humanized for the 3 APOE alleles. In contrast to prior studies using neuronal cultures, we found in the brain that both App gene expression, and the levels of APP holoprotein were not affected by APOE genotype. Additionally, our analysis of APP fragments showed that APOE genotype does not impact APP processing in the brain: the levels of both α- and β-cleaved soluble APP fragments (sAPPs) were similar across genotypes, as were the levels of the membrane-associated α- and β-cleaved C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP. Lastly, APOE genotype did not impact the level of soluble amyloid beta (Aβ). These findings argue that the APOE-allele-dependent AD risk is independent of the brain expression and processing of APP.",Neurobiol Aging,2021
32968074,Risk prediction of late-onset Alzheimer's disease implies an oligogenic architecture.,"Genetic association studies have identified 44 common genome-wide significant risk loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, LOAD genetic architecture and prediction are unclear. Here we estimate the optimal P-threshold (P<sub>optimal</sub>) of a genetic risk score (GRS) for prediction of LOAD in three independent datasets comprising 676 cases and 35,675 family history proxy cases. We show that the discriminative ability of GRS in LOAD prediction is maximised when selecting a small number of SNPs. Both simulation results and direct estimation indicate that the number of causal common SNPs for LOAD may be less than 100, suggesting LOAD is more oligogenic than polygenic. The best GRS explains approximately 75% of SNP-heritability, and individuals in the top decile of GRS have ten-fold increased odds when compared to those in the bottom decile. In addition, 14 variants are identified that contribute to both LOAD risk and age at onset of LOAD.",Nat Commun,2020
36342969,Mosaic patterns of selection in genomic regions associated with diverse human traits.,"Natural selection shapes the genetic architecture of many human traits. However, the prevalence of different modes of selection on genomic regions associated with variation in traits remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed an efficient computational framework to calculate positive and negative enrichment of different evolutionary measures among regions associated with complex traits. We applied the framework to summary statistics from >900 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and 11 evolutionary measures of sequence constraint, population differentiation, and allele age while accounting for linkage disequilibrium, allele frequency, and other potential confounders. We demonstrate that this framework yields consistent results across GWASs with variable sample sizes, numbers of trait-associated SNPs, and analytical approaches. The resulting evolutionary atlas maps diverse signatures of selection on genomic regions associated with complex human traits on an unprecedented scale. We detected positive enrichment for sequence conservation among trait-associated regions for the majority of traits (>77% of 290 high power GWASs), which included reproductive traits. Many traits also exhibited substantial positive enrichment for population differentiation, especially among hair, skin, and pigmentation traits. In contrast, we detected widespread negative enrichment for signatures of balancing selection (51% of GWASs) and absence of enrichment for evolutionary signals in regions associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These results support a pervasive role for negative selection on regions of the human genome that contribute to variation in complex traits, but also demonstrate that diverse modes of evolution are likely to have shaped trait-associated loci. This atlas of evolutionary signatures across the diversity of available GWASs will enable exploration of the relationship between the genetic architecture and evolutionary processes in the human genome.",PLoS Genet,2022
26505992,Melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss in Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are photoreceptors driving circadian photoentrainment, and circadian dysfunction characterizes Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated mRGCs in AD, hypothesizing that they contribute to circadian dysfunction.
METHODS: We assessed retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 21 mild-moderate AD patients, and in a subgroup of 16 we evaluated rest-activity circadian rhythm by actigraphy. We studied postmortem mRGCs by immunohistochemistry in retinas, and axons in optic nerve cross-sections of 14 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients. We coimmunostained for retinal amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and melanopsin to locate mRGCs. All AD cohorts were compared with age-matched controls.
RESULTS: We demonstrated an age-related optic neuropathy in AD by OCT, with a significant reduction of RNFL thickness (p = 0.038), more evident in the superior quadrant (p = 0.006). Axonal loss was confirmed in postmortem AD optic nerves. Abnormal circadian function characterized only a subgroup of AD patients. Sleep efficiency was significantly reduced in AD patients (p = 0.001). We also found a significant loss of mRGCs in postmortem AD retinal specimens (p = 0.003) across all ages and abnormal mRGC dendritic morphology and size (p = 0.003). In flat-mounted AD retinas, Aβ accumulation was remarkably evident inside and around mRGCs.
INTERPRETATION: We show variable degrees of rest-activity circadian dysfunction in AD patients. We also demonstrate age-related loss of optic nerve axons and specifically mRGC loss and pathology in postmortem AD retinal specimens, associated with Aβ deposition. These results all support the concept that mRGC degeneration is a contributor to circadian rhythm dysfunction in AD.",Ann Neurol,2015
24586201,Molecular evidence for the inverse comorbidity between central nervous system disorders and cancers detected by transcriptomic meta-analyses.,"There is epidemiological evidence that patients with certain Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders have a lower than expected probability of developing some types of Cancer. We tested here the hypothesis that this inverse comorbidity is driven by molecular processes common to CNS disorders and Cancers, and that are deregulated in opposite directions. We conducted transcriptomic meta-analyses of three CNS disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia) and three Cancer types (Lung, Prostate, Colorectal) previously described with inverse comorbidities. A significant overlap was observed between the genes upregulated in CNS disorders and downregulated in Cancers, as well as between the genes downregulated in CNS disorders and upregulated in Cancers. We also observed expression deregulations in opposite directions at the level of pathways. Our analysis points to specific genes and pathways, the upregulation of which could increase the incidence of CNS disorders and simultaneously lower the risk of developing Cancer, while the downregulation of another set of genes and pathways could contribute to a decrease in the incidence of CNS disorders while increasing the Cancer risk. These results reinforce the previously proposed involvement of the PIN1 gene, Wnt and P53 pathways, and reveal potential new candidates, in particular related with protein degradation processes.",PLoS Genet,2014
28097205,Impact of tau and amyloid burden on glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.,"In a multimodal PET imaging approach, we determined the differential contribution of neurofibrillary tangles (measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451) and beta-amyloid burden (measured with [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB) on degree of neurodegeneration (i.e., glucose metabolism measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Across brain regions, we observed an interactive effect of beta-amyloid burden and tau deposition on glucose metabolism which was most pronounced in the parietal lobe.

28504673,A fluoro-Nissl dye identifies pericytes as distinct vascular mural cells during in vivo brain imaging.,"Pericytes and smooth muscle cells are integral components of the brain microvasculature. However, no techniques exist to unambiguously identify these cell types, greatly limiting their investigation in vivo. Here we show that the fluorescent Nissl dye NeuroTrace 500/525 labels brain pericytes with specificity, allowing high-resolution optical imaging in the live mouse. We demonstrate that capillary pericytes are a population of mural cells with distinct morphological, molecular and functional features that do not overlap with precapillary or arteriolar smooth muscle actin-expressing cells. The remarkable specificity for dye uptake suggests that pericytes have molecular transport mechanisms not present in other brain cells. We demonstrate feasibility of longitudinal pericyte imaging during microvascular development and aging and in models of brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease. The ability to easily label pericytes in any mouse model opens the possibility of a broad range of investigations of mural cells in vascular development, neurovascular coupling and neuropathology.",Nat Neurosci,2017
34172723,Protein mimetic amyloid inhibitor potently abrogates cancer-associated mutant p53 aggregation and restores tumor suppressor function.,"Missense mutations in p53 are severely deleterious and occur in over 50% of all human cancers. The majority of these mutations are located in the inherently unstable DNA-binding domain (DBD), many of which destabilize the domain further and expose its aggregation-prone hydrophobic core, prompting self-assembly of mutant p53 into inactive cytosolic amyloid-like aggregates. Screening an oligopyridylamide library, previously shown to inhibit amyloid formation associated with Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes, identified a tripyridylamide, ADH-6, that abrogates self-assembly of the aggregation-nucleating subdomain of mutant p53 DBD. Moreover, ADH-6 targets and dissociates mutant p53 aggregates in human cancer cells, which restores p53's transcriptional activity, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Notably, ADH-6 treatment effectively shrinks xenografts harboring mutant p53, while exhibiting no toxicity to healthy tissue, thereby substantially prolonging survival. This study demonstrates the successful application of a bona fide small-molecule amyloid inhibitor as a potent anticancer agent.",Nat Commun,2021
30517207,Longer TOMM40 poly-T variants associated with higher FDDNP-PET medial temporal tau and amyloid binding.,"BACKGROUND: The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40), which lies in linkage disequilibrium with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). TOMM40 influences AD pathology through mitochondrial neurotoxicity, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the most likely brain region for identifying early manifestations of AD-related morphology changes. While early reports indicated that the longer length poly-T allele of TOMM40 increases risk for AD, these findings have not been consistently replicated in further studies. We examined the effect of TOMM40 and APOE on regional brain positron emission tomography (PET) 2-(1-{6-[(2 [F18]fluoroethyl) (methyl) amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) binding values in MTL.
METHODS: A total of 73 non-demented older adults (42 females; mean age: 62.9(10.9) completed genotyping for both APOE and TOMM40 and received FDDNP-PET scans. For TOMM40, the lengths of the poly-T sequence were classified as short (14-20 repeats; S), long (21-29 repeats, L) or very long (>29 repeats, VL). Using general linear models, we examined medial temporal lobe FDDNP binding and cognitive functioning between TOMM40 and APOE-4 groups, with age, sex, and education as covariates.
RESULTS: Data from 30 individuals with APOE-4 and L TOMM40 poly-T length, 11 non E4 TOMM40 S/S, 14 non E4 TOMM40 S/VL and 13 non E4 TOMM40 VL/VL were analyzed. Medial temporal FDDNP binding differed significantly between TOMM40/APOE groups (F(3,62) = 3.3,p = .03). Participants with TOMM40 S/S exhibited significantly lower binding compared to TOMM40 S/VL and APOE-4 carriers. We did not find a significant relationship between TOMM40 poly-T lengths/APOE risk groups and cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to demonstrate a significant association between longer TOMM40 poly-T lengths and higher medial temporal plaque and tangle burden in non-demented older adults. Identifying biomarkers that are risk factors for AD will enhance our ability to identify subjects likely to benefit from novel AD treatments.",PLoS One,2018
32720099,Plasma p-tau181 accurately predicts Alzheimer's disease pathology at least 8 years prior to post-mortem and improves the clinical characterisation of cognitive decline.,"The neuropathological confirmation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) remains the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nowadays, the in vivo diagnosis of AD is greatly aided by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers. Although highly accurate, their broad implementation is restricted by high cost, limited accessibility and invasiveness. We recently developed a high-performance, ultrasensitive immunoassay for the quantification of tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau181) in plasma, which identifies AD pathophysiology with high accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether plasma p-tau181, measured years before the death, can predict the eventual neuropathological confirmation of AD, and successfully discriminates AD from non-AD dementia pathologies. We studied a unique cohort of 115 individuals with longitudinal blood collections with clinical evaluation at 8, 4 and 2 years prior to neuropathological assessment at death. The results demonstrate that plasma p-tau181 associates better with AD neuropathology and Braak staging than a clinical diagnosis 8 years before post-mortem. Moreover, while all patients had a diagnosis of AD dementia during life, plasma p-tau181 proved to discriminate AD from non-AD pathologies with high accuracy (AUC = 97.4%, 95% CI = 94.1-100%) even 8 years before death. Additionally, the longitudinal trajectory of plasma p-tau181 was assessed in all patients. We found that the main increases in plasma p-tau181 occurred between 8 and 4 years prior to death in patients with AD neuropathology and later plateauing. In contrast, non-AD pathologies and controls exhibited minor, albeit significant, increases in p-tau181 up until death. Overall, our study demonstrates that plasma p-tau181 is highly predictive and specific of AD neuropathology years before post-mortem examination. These data add further support for the use of plasma p-tau181 to aid clinical management in primary care and recruitment for clinical trials.",Acta Neuropathol,2020
34759274,Mild behavioral impairment correlates of cognitive impairments in older adults without dementia: mediation by amyloid pathology.,"The relationship between mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intricate and still not well investigated. The purpose of the study is to examine the roles of the AD imaging pathologies in modulating the associations of MBI with cognitive impairments. We analyzed 1129 participants (563 [49.86%] female), who had measures of Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), cognition, and amyloid PET AD biomarkers from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We assess the longitudinal neuropathological and clinical correlates of baseline MBI via linear mixed effects and Cox proportional hazard models. The mediation analyses were used to test the mediation effects of AD pathologies on cognition. We found that MBI was associated with worse global cognition as represented by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p < 0.001), and higher β-amyloid burden (p < 0.001). β-amyloid partially mediated the effects of MBI on cognition with the mediation percentage varied from 14.67 to 40.86% for general cognition, memory, executive, and language functions for non-dementia individuals. However, no significant associations were discovered between MBI and tau burden or neurodegeneration. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses revealed that individuals with MBI had a faster increase in brain amyloid burden (p < 0.001) and a higher risk of clinical conversion (HR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.45 to 4.01 p < 0.001). In conclusion, MBI could be an imperative prediction indicator of clinical and pathological progression. In addition, amyloid pathologies might partially mediate the influences of MBI on cognitive impairments and AD risk.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
20879366,Simultaneous fine and coarse diffeomorphic registration: application to atrophy measurement in Alzheimer's disease.,"In this paper, we present a fine and coarse approach for the multiscale registration of 3D medical images using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM). This approach has particularly interesting properties since it estimates large, smooth and invertible optimal deformations having a rich descriptive power for the quantification of temporal changes in the images. First, we show the importance of the smoothing kernel and its influence on the final solution. We then propose a new strategy for the spatial regularization of the deformations, which uses simultaneously fine and coarse smoothing kernels. We have evaluated the approach on both 2D synthetic images as well as on 3D MR longitudinal images out of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Results highlight the regularizing properties of our approach for the registration of complex shapes. More importantly, the results also demonstrate its ability to measure shape variations at several scales simultaneously while keeping the desirable properties of LDDMM. This opens new perspectives for clinical applications.",Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv,2010
20569437,Neuroinflammation in Lyme neuroborreliosis affects amyloid metabolism.,"BACKGROUND: The metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) is widely studied in Alzheimer's disease, where Abeta deposition and plaque development are essential components of the pathogenesis. However, the physiological role of amyloid in the adult nervous system remains largely unknown. We have previously found altered cerebral amyloid metabolism in other neuroinflammatory conditions. To further elucidate this, we investigated amyloid metabolism in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).
METHODS: The first part of the study was a cross-sectional cohort study in 61 patients with acute facial palsy (19 with LNB and 42 with idiopathic facial paresis, Bell's palsy) and 22 healthy controls. CSF was analysed for the beta-amyloid peptides Abeta38, Abeta40 and Abeta42, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms alpha-sAPP and beta-sAPP. CSF total-tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and neurofilament protein (NFL) were measured to monitor neural cell damage. The second part of the study was a prospective cohort-study in 26 LNB patients undergoing consecutive lumbar punctures before and after antibiotic treatment to study time-dependent dynamics of the biomarkers.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, LNB patients had lower levels of CSF alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau, and higher levels of CSF NFL than healthy controls and patients with Bell's palsy. In the prospective study, LNB patients had low levels of CSF alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau at baseline, which all increased towards normal at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid metabolism is altered in LNB. CSF levels of alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau are decreased in acute infection and increase after treatment. In combination with earlier findings in multiple sclerosis, cerebral SLE and HIV with cerebral engagement, this points to an influence of neuroinflammation on amyloid metabolism.",BMC Neurol,2010
34041783,Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in Relationship to Alzheimer and Vascular Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.
METHODS: Fifty-five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain-specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.
RESULTS: Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.
INTERPRETATION: These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:227-238.",Ann Neurol,2021
25616912,Isolation and characterization of antibody fragments selective for toxic oligomeric tau.,"Oligomeric tau species are important in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as they are neurotoxic and can propagate tau-tangle pathology. Therefore, reagents that selectively recognize different key morphologies of tau are needed to help define the role of tau in AD and related diseases. We utilized a biopanning protocol that combines the binding diversity of phage-displayed antibody libraries with the powerful imaging capability of atomic force microscopy to isolate single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that selectively bind toxic oligomeric tau. We isolated 3 different antibody fragments that bind oligomeric but not monomeric or fibrillar tau. The scFvs differentiate brain tissue homogenates of both 3×TG and tau-AD mice from wild-type mice, detecting oligomeric tau at much earlier ages than when neurofibrillary tangles are typically detected. The scFvs also distinguish human postmortem AD brain tissue from cognitively normal postmortem human brain tissue, demonstrating the potential of this approach for developing biomarkers for early detection and progression of AD.",Neurobiol Aging,2014
33152005,The association of clinical phenotypes to known AD/FTD genetic risk loci and their inter-relationship.,"To elucidate how variants in genetic risk loci previously implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) contribute to expression of disease phenotypes, a phenome-wide association study was performed in two waves. In the first wave, we explored clinical traits associated with thirteen genetic variants previously reported to be linked to disease risk using both the 23andMe and UKB cohorts. We tested 30 additional AD variants in UKB cohort only in the second wave. APOE variants defining ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles and rs646776 were identified to be significantly associated with metabolic/cardiovascular and longevity traits. APOE variants were also significantly associated with neurological traits. ABI3 variant rs28394864 was significantly associated with cardiovascular (e.g. (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, angina) and immune-related trait asthma. Both APOE variants and CLU variant were significantly associated with nearsightedness. HLA- DRB1 variant was associated with diseases with immune-related traits. Additionally, variants from 10+ AD genes (BZRAP1-AS1, ADAMTS4, ADAM10, APH1B, SCIMP, ABI3, SPPL2A, ZNF232, GRN, CD2AP, and CD33) were associated with hematological measurements such as white blood cell (leukocyte) count, monocyte count, neutrophill count, platelet count, and/or mean platelet (thrombocyte) volume (an autoimmune disease biomarker). Many of these genes are expressed specifically in microglia. The associations of ABI3 variant with cardiovascular and immune-related traits are one of the novel findings from this study. Taken together, it is evidenced that at least some AD and FTD variants are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes and not just dementia. These findings were discussed in the context of causal relationship versus pleiotropy via Mendelian randomization analysis.",PLoS One,2020
31920936,Therapeutic Applications of Cysteamine and Cystamine in Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Diseases.,"Current medications for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Schizophrenia mainly target disease symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics that can delay, halt or reverse disease progression. AD, HD, PD, and schizophrenia are characterized by elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress, which play a central role in pathogenesis. Clinical trials utilizing antioxidants to counter disease progression have largely been unsuccessful. Most antioxidants are relatively non-specific and do not adequately target neuroprotective pathways. Accordingly, a search for agents that restore redox balance as well as halt or reverse neuronal loss is underway. The small molecules, cysteamine, the decarboxylated derivative of the amino acid cysteine, and cystamine, the oxidized form of cysteamine, respectively, mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation and upregulate neuroprotective pathways involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Cysteamine can traverse the blood brain barrier, a desirable characteristic of drugs targeting neurodegeneration. This review addresses recent developments in the use of these aminothiols to counter neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric deficits.",Front Neurol,2019
28477083,Peritoneal dialysis reduces amyloid-beta plasma levels in humans and attenuates Alzheimer-associated phenotypes in an APP/PS1 mouse model.,"Clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) from the brain is an important therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current studies mainly focus on the central approach of Aβ clearance by introducing therapeutic agents into the brain. In a previous study, we found that peripheral tissues and organs play important roles in clearing brain-derived Aβ, suggesting that the peripheral approach of removing Aβ from the blood may also be effective for AD therapy. Here, we investigated whether peritoneal dialysis, a clinically available therapeutic method for chronic kidney disease (CKD), reduces brain Aβ burden and attenuates AD-type pathologies and cognitive impairments. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed CKD were enrolled. The plasma Aβ concentrations of the patients were measured before and after peritoneal dialysis. APP/PS1 mice were subjected to peritoneal dialysis once a day for 1 month from 6 months of age (prevention study) or 9 months of age (treatment study). The Aβ in the interstitial fluid (ISF) was collected using microdialysis. Behavioural performance, long-term potentiation (LTP), Aβ burden and other AD-type pathologies were measured after 1 month of peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis significantly reduced plasma Aβ levels in both CKD patients and APP/PS1 mice. Aβ levels in the brain ISF of APP/PS1 mice immediately decreased after reduction of Aβ in the blood during peritoneal dialysis. In both prevention and treatment studies, peritoneal dialysis substantially reduced Aβ deposition, attenuated other AD-type pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, glial activation, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunction, and rescued the behavioural deficits of APPswe/PS1 mice. Importantly, the Aβ phagocytosis function of microglia was enhanced in APP/PS1 mice after peritoneal dialysis. Our study suggests that peritoneal dialysis is a promising therapeutic method for AD, and Aβ clearance using a peripheral approach could be a desirable therapeutic strategy for AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2017
33238137,"Transformative Network Modeling of Multi-omics Data Reveals Detailed Circuits, Key Regulators, and Potential Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease.","To identify the molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), we performed an integrative network analysis of multi-omics profiling of four cortical areas across 364 donors with varying cognitive and neuropathological phenotypes. Our analyses revealed thousands of molecular changes and uncovered neuronal gene subnetworks as the most dysregulated in LOAD. ATP6V1A was identified as a key regulator of a top-ranked neuronal subnetwork, and its role in disease-related processes was evaluated through CRISPR-based manipulation in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and RNAi-based knockdown in Drosophila models. Neuronal impairment and neurodegeneration caused by ATP6V1A deficit were improved by a repositioned compound, NCH-51. This study provides not only a global landscape but also detailed signaling circuits of complex molecular interactions in key brain regions affected by LOAD, and the resulting network models will serve as a blueprint for developing next-generation therapeutic agents against LOAD.",Neuron,2020
35260199,A neurodegenerative disease landscape of rare mutations in Colombia due to founder effects.,"BACKGROUND: The Colombian population, as well as those in other Latin American regions, arose from a recent tri-continental admixture among Native Americans, Spanish invaders, and enslaved Africans, all of whom passed through a population bottleneck due to widespread infectious diseases that left small isolated local settlements. As a result, the current population reflects multiple founder effects derived from diverse ancestries.
METHODS: We characterized the role of admixture and founder effects on the origination of the mutational landscape that led to neurodegenerative disorders under these historical circumstances. Genomes from 900 Colombian individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [n = 376], frontotemporal lobar degeneration-motor neuron disease continuum (FTLD-MND) [n = 197], early-onset dementia not otherwise specified (EOD) [n = 73], and healthy participants [n = 254] were analyzed. We examined their global and local ancestry proportions and screened this cohort for deleterious variants in disease-causing and risk-conferring genes.
RESULTS: We identified 21 pathogenic variants in AD-FTLD related genes, and PSEN1 harbored the majority (11 pathogenic variants). Variants were identified from all three continental ancestries. TREM2 heterozygous and homozygous variants were the most common among AD risk genes (102 carriers), a point of interest because the disease risk conferred by these variants differed according to ancestry. Several gene variants that have a known association with MND in European populations had FTLD phenotypes on a Native American haplotype. Consistent with founder effects, identity by descent among carriers of the same variant was frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: Colombian demography with multiple mini-bottlenecks probably enhanced the detection of founder events and left a proportionally higher frequency of rare variants derived from the ancestral populations. These findings demonstrate the role of genomically defined ancestry in phenotypic disease expression, a phenotypic range of different rare mutations in the same gene, and further emphasize the importance of inclusiveness in genetic studies.",Genome Med,2022
27875990,"Inverse relationship between Alzheimer's disease and cancer, and other factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: The AD etiology is yet not properly known. Interactions among environmental factors, multiple susceptibility genes and aging, contribute to AD. This study investigates the factors that play role in causing AD and how changes in cellular pathways contribute to AD.
METHODS: PUBMED database, MEDLINE database and Google Scholar were searched with no date restrictions for published articles involving cellular pathways with roles in cancers, cell survival, growth, proliferation, development, aging, and also contributing to Alzheimer's disease. This research explores inverse relationship between AD and cancer, also investigates other factors behind AD using several already published research literature to find the etiology of AD.
RESULTS: Cancer and Alzheimer's disease have inverse relationship in many aspects such as P53, estrogen, neurotrophins and growth factors, growth and proliferation, cAMP, EGFR, Bcl-2, apoptosis pathways, IGF-1, HSV, TDP-43, APOE variants, notch signals and presenilins, NCAM, TNF alpha, PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway, telomerase, ROS, ACE levels. AD occurs when brain neurons have weakened growth, cell survival responses, maintenance mechanisms, weakened anti-stress responses such as Vimentin, Carbonic anhydrases, HSPs, SAPK. In cancer, these responses are upregulated and maintained. Evolutionarily conserved responses and maintenance mechanisms such as FOXO are impaired in AD. Countermeasures or compensatory mechanisms by AD affected neurons such as Tau, Beta Amyloid, S100, are last attempts for survival which may be protective for certain time, or can speed up AD in Alzheimer's microenvironment via C-ABL activation, GSK3, neuro-inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease and Cancer have inverse relationship; many factors that are upregulated in any cancer to sustain growth and survival are downregulated in Alzheimer's disease contributing to neuro-degeneration. When aged neurons or genetically susceptible neurons have weakened growth, cell survival and anti-stress responses, age related gene expression changes, altered regulation of cell death and maintenance mechanisms, they contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Countermeasures by AD neurons such as Beta Amyloid Plaques, NFTs, S100, are last attempts for survival and this provides neuroprotection for certain time and ultimately may become pathological and speed up AD. This study may contribute in developing new potential diagnostic tests, interventions and treatments.",BMC Neurol,2016
27836335,A novel presenilin 1 mutation (F388L) identified in a Chinese family with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.,"A subset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurrence shows autosomal dominant, familial inheritance patterns. Such familial AD (FAD) are caused by mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, which encode amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2), respectively. Here, we report a novel PSEN1 mutation (c.1164C > G, p.F388L, mutation nomenclature according to National Center for Biotechnology Information Reference Sequence: NM_000021.3) occurring in a Chinese family with early-onset AD and cosegregating with affected family members. The average age at onset of this family was 43 years. The F388L mutation locates adjacent to the critical catalytic aspartate site (D385) of PS1. Overexpression of the F388L mutant significantly increased Aβ42 secretion and the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 when compared with wild type PS1, consisting with the notion that FAD-associated PS1 mutations induce disease pathogenesis by increasing Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Our results identify a novel pathogenic PS1 F388L mutation in a Chinese FAD family.",Neurobiol Aging,2016

34354038,BRUCE silencing leads to axonal dystrophy by repressing autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Alzheimer's disease.,"Axonal dystrophy is a swollen and tortuous neuronal process that contributes to synaptic alterations occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous study identified that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) at the axon terminal and then the signal is propagated along the axon to the cell body and affects neuronal function through retrograde transport. Therefore, this study was designed to identify a microRNA (miRNA) that alters related components of the transport machinery to affect BDNF retrograde signaling deficits in AD. Hippocampus tissues were isolated from APP/PS1 transgenic (AD-model) mice and C57BL/6J wild-type mice and subject to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and immunohistochemical staining. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion and nuclear translocation of BDNF was detected using immunofluorescence in HT22 cells. The interaction among miR-204, BIR repeat containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (BRUCE) and Syntaxin 17 (STX17) was investigated using dual luciferase reporter gene assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. The expression of relevant genes and proteins were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Knockdown of STX17 or BRUCE inhibited autophagosome-lysosome fusion and impacted axon growth in HT22 cells. STX17 immunoprecipitating with BRUCE and co-localization of them demonstrated BRUCE interacted with STX17. BRUCE was the target of miR-204, and partial loss of miR-204 by inhibitor promoted autophagosome-lysosome fusion to prevent axon dystrophy and accumulated BDNF nuclear translocation to rescue BDNF/TrkB signaling deficits in HT22 cells. The overall results demonstrated that inhibition of miR-204 prevents axonal dystrophy by blocking BRUCE interaction with STX17, which unraveled potential novel therapeutic targets for delaying AD.",Transl Psychiatry,2021
36910862,Patterns of structure-function association in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease: Screening for mild cognitive impairment and dementia with ML regression and classification models.,"BACKGROUND: The combined analysis of imaging and functional modalities is supposed to improve diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases with advanced data science techniques.
OBJECTIVE: To get an insight into normal and accelerated brain aging by developing the machine learning models that predict individual performance in neuropsychological and cognitive tests from brain MRI. With these models we endeavor to look for patterns of brain structure-function association (SFA) indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the age-related variability of cognitive and neuropsychological test scores in normal and accelerated aging and constructed regression models predicting functional performance in cognitive tests from brain radiomics data. The models were trained on the three study cohorts from ADNI dataset-cognitively normal individuals, patients with MCI or dementia-separately. We also looked for significant correlations between cortical parcellation volumes and test scores in the cohorts to investigate neuroanatomical differences in relation to cognitive status. Finally, we worked out an approach for the classification of the examinees according to the pattern of structure-function associations into the cohorts of the cognitively normal elderly and patients with MCI or dementia.
RESULTS: In the healthy population, the global cognitive functioning slightly changes with age. It also remains stable across the disease course in the majority of cases. In healthy adults and patients with MCI or dementia, the trendlines of performance in digit symbol substitution test and trail making test converge at the approximated point of 100 years of age. According to the SFA pattern, we distinguish three cohorts: the cognitively normal elderly, patients with MCI, and dementia. The highest accuracy is achieved with the model trained to predict the mini-mental state examination score from voxel-based morphometry data. The application of the majority voting technique to models predicting results in cognitive tests improved the classification performance up to 91.95% true positive rate for healthy participants, 86.21%-for MCI and 80.18%-for dementia cases.
CONCLUSION: The machine learning model, when trained on the cases of this of that group, describes a disease-specific SFA pattern. The pattern serves as a ""stamp"" of the disease reflected by the model.",Front Aging Neurosci,2022
39574903,"DNA methylation age from peripheral blood predicts progression to Alzheimer's disease, white matter disease burden, and cortical atrophy.","Cross-sectional studies suggest a limited relationship between accelerated epigenetic aging derived from epigenetic clocks, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology or risk. However, most prior analyses have not utilized longitudinal analyses or whole-brain neuroimaging biomarkers of AD. Herein, we employed longitudinal modeling and structural neuroimaging analyses to test the hypothesis that accelerated epigenetic aging would predict AD progression. Using survival analyses, we found that two second generation epigenetic clocks, DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge, predicted progression from cognitively normal aging to mild cognitive impairment or AD and worse longitudinal cognitive outcomes. Epigenetic age was also strongly associated with cortical thinning in AD-relevant regions and white matter disease burden. Thus, in contrast to earlier work suggesting limited applicability of blood-based epigenetic clocks in AD, our novel analytic framework suggests that second-generation epigenetic clocks have broad utility and may represent promising predictors of AD risk and pathophysiology.",Res Sq,2024
36155517,"An Alzheimer's Disease Mechanism Based on Early Pathology, Anatomy, Vascular-Induced Flow, and Migration of Maximum Flow Stress Energy Location with Increasing Vascular Disease.","This paper suggests a chemical mechanism for the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress ""hot spots"" in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as Aβ and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest Aβ and tau AD disease pathologies. A key to the proposed AD mechanism is a comparison of early chronic traumatic encephalopathy and AD pathologies. Experiments that test the proposed mechanism are needed.",J Alzheimers Dis,2022

31066065,Von Economo neurons are part of a larger neuronal population that are selectively vulnerable in C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia.,"AIMS: The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia with a C9orf72 expansion (C9-bvFTD) is characterised by early changes in social-emotional cognition that are linked to the loss of von Economo neurons (VENs). Together with a subset of neighbouring pyramidal neurons, VENs express the GABA receptor subunit theta (GABRQ). It is not known if the selective vulnerability of VENs in C9-bvFTD also includes this GABRQ-expressing population.
METHODS: We quantified VENs and GABRQ immunopositive neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in C9-bvFTD (n = 16), controls (n = 12) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 7). Second, we assessed VENs and GABRQ-expressing populations in relation to the clinicopathological profiles.
RESULTS: We found the number of VENs and GABRQ-expressing neurons and their ratio over the total layer 5 neuronal population was lower in C9-bvFTD compared to control and AD. C9-bvFTD donors with underlying TDP43 type A pathology in the ACC showed the highest loss of GABRQ-expressing neurons. C9-bvFTD donors that did not present with motor neuron disease (MND) symptoms in the first half of their disease course showed a prominent loss of GABRQ-expressing neurons compared to controls. C9-bvFTD donors with no symptoms of psychosis showed a higher loss compared to controls. Across all donors, the number of VENs correlated strongly with the number of GABRQ-expressing neurons.
CONCLUSION: We show that VENs, together with GABRQ-expressing neurons, are selectively vulnerable in C9-bvFTD but are both spared in AD. This suggests they are related and that this GABRQ-expressing population of VENs and pyramidal neurons, is a key modulator of social-emotional functioning.",Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,2019
34183654,Higher CSF sTNFR1-related proteins associate with better prognosis in very early Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuroinflammation is associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the application of cerebrospinal fluid measures of inflammatory proteins may be limited by overlapping pathways and relationships between them.

We further show higher levels of proteins related to soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 are associated with reduced risk of conversion to dementia in the multi-centered (p = 0.027) and independent (p = 0.038) cohorts of people with mild cognitive impairment due to predicted Alzheimer's disease, while higher soluble TREM2 levels associated with slower decline in the dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease.

Literature searches were conducted for brain morphometry and neuropsychological studies including a PCA and a tAD group. Compared to healthy controls (HC), PCA patients exhibited significant decreases in temporal, occipital and parietal gray matter (GM) volumes, whereas tAD patients showed extensive left temporal atrophy. Compared to tAD patients, participants with PCA showed greater GM volume reduction in the right occipital gyrus extending to the posterior lobule. In addition, PCA patients showed less GM volume loss in the left parahippocampal gyrus and left hippocampus than tAD patients. PCA patients exhibit significantly greater impairment in Immediate Visuospatial Memory as well as Visuoperceptual and Visuospatial Abilities than patients with tAD. However, tAD patients showed greater impairment in Delayed Auditory/Verbal Memory than patients with PCA.

20713948,Multimodal predictors for Alzheimer disease in nonfluent primary progressive aphasia.,"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are hypothesized to cause clinically distinct forms of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) that predominantly affect expressive speech. AD is thought to cause logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), and FTLD may cause progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). We sought to determine the value of clinical characterization, neuropsychological analysis, and MRI atrophy in predicting pathology of LPA and PNFA.
METHODS: Patients with LPA (n = 19) and patients with PNFA (n = 19) were evaluated with neuropsychological assessments, structural MRI, CSF analysis, and neuropathologic examination.
RESULTS: Twelve of 19 patients with LPA (63%) and 6 of 19 patients with PNFA (32%) had neuropathologic findings or CSF biomarkers consistent with AD. Neuropsychological testing showed that naming was more impaired in patients with AD, and letter-guided fluency was more affected in patients with a non-AD disorder. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that in patients with AD, patients with LPA and PNFA had significant posterior-superior temporal atrophy; in patients with non-AD, patients with LPA had peri-Sylvian atrophy and patients with PNFA had dorsolateral prefrontal and insular atrophy. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that combining neuropsychological testing with MRI atrophy pattern had 90% specificity for pathology or CSF biomarkers consistent with AD, and combining clinical features with neuropsychological analysis had 100% sensitivity for pathology or CSF biomarkers consistent with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither PPA phenotyping nor imaging alone is a reliable predictor of pathology. Multimodal predictors, such as combining neuropsychological testing with MRI analysis, can improve noninvasive prediction of underlying pathology in nonfluent forms of PPA.",Neurology,2010
39639016,Homeostatic microglia initially seed and activated microglia later reshape amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The role of microglia in the amyloid cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is debated due to conflicting findings. Using a genetic and a pharmacological approach we demonstrate that depletion of microglia before amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition, leads to a reduction in plaque numbers and neuritic dystrophy, confirming their role in plaque initiation. Transplanting human microglia restores Aβ plaque formation. While microglia depletion reduces insoluble Aβ levels, soluble Aβ concentrations stay consistent, challenging the view that microglia clear Aβ. In later stages, microglial depletion decreases plaque compaction and increases neuritic dystrophy, suggesting a protective role. Human microglia with the TREM2<sup>R47H/R47H</sup> mutation exacerbate plaque pathology, emphasizing the importance of non-reactive microglia in the initiation of the amyloid cascade. Adaptive immune depletion (Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>) does not affect microglia's impact on plaque formation. These findings clarify conflicting reports, identifying microglia as key drivers of amyloid pathology, and raise questions about optimal therapeutic strategies for AD.",Nat Commun,2024
23982627,Peripheral and central nervous system inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in man by the novel inhibitor ABT-384.,"ABT-384 is a potent, selective inhibitor of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD-1). One milligram of ABT-384 daily fully inhibited hepatic HSD-1. Establishing the dose that fully inhibits central nervous system (CNS) HSD-1 would enable definitive clinical studies in potential CNS indications. [9,11,12,12-(2)H4] cortisol (D4 cortisol), a stable labeled tracer, was used to characterize HSD-1 inhibition by ABT-384. D4 cortisol and its products were measured in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy male volunteers during D4 cortisol infusions, for up to 40 h after five daily doses of 1-50 mg ABT-384. Similar procedures were conducted in control subjects who received no ABT-384. Peripheral HSD-1 inhibition was calculated from plasma levels of D4 cortisol and its products. CNS HSD-1 inhibition was characterized from plasma and CSF levels of D4 cortisol and its products. ABT-384 regimens ≥2 mg daily maintained peripheral HSD-1 inhibition ≥88%. ABT-384 1 mg daily maintained peripheral HSD-1 inhibition ≥81%. No CNS formation of D3 cortisol (the mass-labeled product of HSD-1) was detected following ABT-384 ≥2 mg daily, indicating full CNS HSD-1 inhibition by these regimens. Partial CNS HSD-1 inhibition was associated with 1 mg ABT-384 daily. CNS HSD-1 inhibition was characterized by strong hysteresis and increased with maximum post-dose plasma concentration of ABT-384 and its active metabolites. ABT-384 has a wide potential therapeutic window for potential indications including Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. Stable labeled substrates may be viable tools for measuring CNS effect during new drug development for other enzyme targets.",Transl Psychiatry,2013
27533593,The Role of Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Stroke in Familial Alzheimer Disease.,"IMPORTANCE: The contribution of cardiovascular disease (CV) and cerebrovascular disease to the risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) has been long debated. Investigations have shown that antecedent CV risk factors increase the risk for LOAD, although other investigations have failed to validate this association.
OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of CV risk factors (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) and the history of stroke to LOAD in a data set of large families multiply affected by LOAD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease family study (hereinafter referred to as NIA-LOAD study) is a longitudinal study of families with multiple members affected with LOAD. A multiethnic community-based longitudinal study (Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project [WHICAP]) was used to replicate findings. The 6553 participants in the NIA-LOAD study were recruited from 23 US Alzheimer disease centers with ongoing data collection since 2003; the 5972 WHICAP participants were recruited at Columbia University with ongoing data collection since 1992. Data analysis was performed from 2003 to 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized mixed logistic regression models tested the association of CV risk factors (primary association) with LOAD. History of stroke was used for the secondary association. A secondary model adjusted for the presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A genetic risk score, based on common variants associated with LOAD, was used to account for LOAD genetic risk beyond the APOE ε4 effect. Mediation analyses evaluated stroke as a mediating factor between the primary association and LOAD.
RESULTS: A total of 6553 NIA-LOAD participants were included in the analyses (4044 women [61.7%]; 2509 men [38.3%]; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9] years), with 5972 individuals from the WHICAP study included in the replication sample (4072 women [68.2%]; 1900 men [31.8%]; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [7.0] years). Hypertension was associated with decreased LOAD risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72); type 2 diabetes and heart disease were not. History of stroke conferred greater than 2-fold increased risk for LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.75-2.83). Adjustment for APOE ε4 did not alter results. The genetic risk score was associated with LOAD (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05-3.97) but did not change the independent association of LOAD with hypertension or stroke. In the WHICAP sample, hypertension was not associated with LOAD (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11), whereas history of stroke increased the risk for LOAD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.56-2.46). The effect of hypertension on LOAD risk was also mediated by stroke in the NIA-LOAD and the WHICAP samples.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In familial and sporadic LOAD, a history of stroke was significantly associated with increased disease risk and mediated the association between selected CV risk factors and LOAD, which appears to be independent of the LOAD-related genetic background.",JAMA Neurol,2016
34136636,A profile of brain reserve in adults at genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our aim was to identify the structural brain measures that mitigate the negative effect of APOE ε4 on cognition, which would have implications for AD diagnosis and treatment trial selection.
METHODS: A total of 742 older adults (mean age: 70.1 ± 8.7 years) were stratified by APOE status and classified as cognitively normal (CDR 0) or with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5). Regional brain volume and cognitive performance were measured.
RESULTS: There were significant interactions between APOE and CDR on the left precuneus and on bilateral superior frontal volumes. These regions were preserved in CDR-0 ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 carriers but were reduced in CDR-0.5 ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 carriers, compared to their respective ε3/ε3 counterparts. Educational attainment predicted greater brain reserve.
DISCUSSION: This pattern of preserved brain structure in cognitively normal ε4 carriers with comprised medial temporal volume is consistent with the theory of brain reserve.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2021
31753701,Prevalence and correlates of mild cognitive impairment among diverse Hispanics/Latinos: Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging results.,"INTRODUCTION: We estimated the prevalence and correlates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among middle-aged and older diverse Hispanics/Latinos.
METHODS: Middle-aged and older diverse Hispanics/Latinos enrolled (n = 6377; 50-86 years) in this multisite prospective cohort study were evaluated for MCI using the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS: The overall MCI prevalence was 9.8%, which varied between Hispanic/Latino groups. Older age, high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and elevated depressive symptoms were significant correlates of MCI prevalence. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE) and APOE2 were not significantly associated with MCI.
DISCUSSION: MCI prevalence varied among Hispanic/Latino backgrounds, but not as widely as reported in the previous studies. CVD risk and depressive symptoms were associated with increased MCI, whereas APOE4 was not, suggesting alternative etiologies for MCI among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. Our findings suggest that mitigating CVD risk factors may offer important pathways to understanding and reducing MCI and possibly dementia among diverse Hispanics/Latinos.",Alzheimers Dement,2019
34819378,Three-dimensional virtual histology of the human hippocampus based on phase-contrast computed tomography.,"We have studied the three-dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture of the human hippocampus in neuropathologically healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals, based on phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography of postmortem human tissue punch biopsies. In view of recent findings suggesting a nuclear origin of AD, we target in particular the nuclear structure of the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Tissue samples of 20 individuals were scanned and evaluated using a highly automated approach of measurement and analysis, combining multiscale recordings, optimized phase retrieval, segmentation by machine learning, representation of structural properties in a feature space, and classification based on the theory of optimal transport. Accordingly, we find that the prototypical transformation between a structure representing healthy granule cells and the pathological state involves a decrease in the volume of granule cell nuclei, as well as an increase in the electron density and its spatial heterogeneity. The latter can be explained by a higher ratio of heterochromatin to euchromatin. Similarly, many other structural properties can be derived from the data, reflecting both the natural polydispersity of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture between different individuals in the physiological context and the structural effects associated with AD pathology.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2021
33188391,Neuropsychiatric symptoms in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease.,"There is clinical overlap between presentations of dementia due to limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that the combination of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC) and LATE neuropathological changes (LATE-NC) is associated with greater neuropsychiatric symptom burden, compared to either pathology alone. Longitudinal Neuropsychiatric Inventory and psychotropic medication prescription data from neuropathologically diagnosed pure ADNC (n = 78), pure LATE-NC (n = 14) and mixed ADNC/LATE-NC (n = 39) brain bank donors were analysed using analysis of variance and linear mixed effects regression models to examine the relationship between diagnostic group and neuropsychiatric symptom burden. Nearly all donors had dementia; three (two pure LATE-NC and one pure ADNC) donors had mild cognitive impairment and another two donors with LATE-NC did not have dementia. The mixed ADNC/LATE-NC group was older than the pure ADNC group, had a higher proportion of females compared to the pure ADNC and LATE-NC groups, and had more severe dementia versus the pure LATE-NC group. After adjustment for length of follow-up, cognitive and demographic factors, mixed ADNC/LATE-NC was associated with lower total Neuropsychiatric Inventory and agitation factor scores than pure ADNC, and lower frontal factor scores than pure LATE-NC. Our findings indicate that concomitant LATE pathology in Alzheimer's disease is not associated with greater neuropsychiatric symptom burden. Future longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate whether mixed ADNC/LATE-NC may be protective against agitation and frontal symptoms in dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or LATE pathology.",Brain,2020
39719507,In vivo hyperphosphorylation of tau is associated with synaptic loss and behavioral abnormalities in the absence of tau seeds.,"Tau pathology is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the sequence of events and the form of tau that confers toxicity are still unclear, due in large part to the lack of physiological models of tauopathy initiation and progression in which to test hypotheses. We have developed a series of targeted mice expressing frontotemporal-dementia-causing mutations in the humanized MAPT gene to investigate the earliest stages of tauopathy. MAPT<sup>Int10+3G&gt;A</sup> and MAPT<sup>S305N;Int10+3G&gt;A</sup> lines show abundant hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but they do not develop seed-competent fibrillar structures. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was accompanied by neurite degeneration, loss of viable synapses and indicators of behavioral abnormalities. Our results demonstrate that neuronal toxicity can occur in the absence of fibrillar, higher-order structures and that tau hyperphosphorylation is probably involved in the earliest etiological events in tauopathies showing isoform ratio imbalance.",Nat Neurosci,2024
30537760,"Effects of Light Treatment on Sleep, Cognition, Mood, and Behavior in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND: Bright light treatment is a therapeutic intervention mainly used to treat sleep and circadian disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Recently, a handful of studies also focused on the effect on cognition and behavior. Conflicting findings are reported in the literature, and no definite conclusions have been drawn about its specific therapeutic effect.
SUMMARY: The aim of this review is to provide a critical evaluation of available evidence in this field, highlighting the specific characteristics of effective bright light treatment. Eligible studies were required to assess at least one of the following outcome measures: sleep, cognition, mood, and/or behavior (e.g., depression, agitation). A total of 32 articles were included in this systematic review and identified as research intervention studies about light treatment in AD. The quality of the papers was evaluated based on the US Preventive Service Task Force guidelines. Key Messages: Overall, the current literature suggests that the effects of light treatment in AD patients are mixed and may be influenced by several factors, but with a general trend toward a positive effect. Bright light seems to be a promising intervention treatment without significant adverse effects; therefore, further well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed taking into account the highlighted recommendations.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,2018
39722190,Proteome profiling of cerebrospinal fluid using machine learning shows a unique protein signature associated with APOE4 genotype.,"Proteome changes associated with APOE4 variant carriage that are independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and diagnosis are unknown. This study investigated APOE4 proteome changes in people with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and no impairment. Clinical, APOE genotype, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome and AD biomarker data was sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Proteome profiling was done using supervised machine learning. We found an APOE4-specific proteome signature that was independent of cognitive diagnosis and AD pathological biomarkers, and increased the risk of progression to cognitive impairment. Proteins were enriched in brain regions including the caudate and cortex and cells including endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Enriched peripheral immune cells included T cells, macrophages, and B cells. APOE4 carriers have a unique CSF proteome signature associated with a strong brain and peripheral immune and inflammatory phenotype that likely underlies APOE4 carriers' vulnerability to cognitive decline and AD as they age.",Aging Cell,2024
33103819,A ketogenic drink improves cognition in mild cognitive impairment: Results of a 6-month RCT.,"INTRODUCTION: Counteracting impaired brain glucose metabolism with ketones may improve cognition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Cognition, plasma ketone response, and metabolic profile were assessed before and 6 months after supplementation with a ketogenic drink containing medium chain triglyceride (ketogenic medium chain triglyceride [kMCT]; 15 g twice/day; n = 39) or placebo (n = 44).
RESULTS: Free and cued recall (Trial 1; P = .047), verbal fluency (categories; P = .024), Boston Naming Test (total correct answers; P = .033), and the Trail-Making Test (total errors; P = .017) improved significantly in the kMCT group compared to placebo (analysis of covariance; pre-intervention score, sex, age, education, and apolipoprotein E4 as covariates). Some cognitive outcomes also correlated positively with plasma ketones. Plasma metabolic profile and ketone response were unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: This kMCT drink improved cognitive outcomes in MCI, at least in part by increasing blood ketone level. These data support further assessment of MCI progression to Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement,2020
38102484,Peripheral immune function and Alzheimer's disease: a living systematic review and critical appraisal.,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature examines the relationship between peripheral immune function and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in human populations. Our living systematic review summarizes the characteristics and findings of these studies, appraises their quality, and formulates recommendations for future research.
METHODS: We searched the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, and reviewed references of previous reviews and meta-analyses to identify human studies examining the relationship between any peripheral immune biomarkers and AD up to September 7th, 2023. We examined patterns of reported statistical associations (positive, negative, and null) between each biomarker and AD across studies. Evidence for each biomarker was categorized into four groups based on the proportion of studies reporting different associations: corroborating a positive association with AD, a negative association, a null association, and presenting contradictory findings. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was employed to assess the quality of the included studies.
FINDINGS: In total, 286 studies were included in this review. The majority were cross-sectional (n = 245, 85.7%) and hospital-based (n = 248, 86.7%), examining relationships between 187 different peripheral immune biomarkers and AD. Cytokines were the most frequently studied group of peripheral immune biomarkers. Evidence supported a positive association with AD for six biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ, ACT, IL-18, and IL-12, and a negative association for two biomarkers, including lymphocytes and IL-6R. Only a small proportion of included studies (n = 22, 7.7%) were deemed to be of high quality based on quality assessment.
INTERPRETATION: Existing research on peripheral immune function and AD exhibits substantial methodological variations and limitations, with a notable lack of longitudinal, population-based studies investigating a broad range of biomarkers with prospective AD outcomes. The extent and manner in which peripheral immune function can contribute to AD pathophysiology remain open questions. Given the biomarkers that we identified to be associated with AD, we posit that targeting peripheral immune dysregulation may present a promising intervention point to reduce the burden of AD.",Mol Psychiatry,2023
32012164,Tensor decomposition of stimulated monocyte and macrophage gene expression profiles identifies neurodegenerative disease-specific trans-eQTLs.,"Recent human genetic studies suggest that cells of the innate immune system have a primary role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the results from these studies often do not elucidate how the genetic variants affect the biology of these cells to modulate disease risk. Here, we applied a tensor decomposition method to uncover disease associated gene networks linked to distal genetic variation in stimulated human monocyte and macrophage gene expression profiles. We report robust evidence that some disease associated genetic variants affect the expression of multiple genes in trans. These include a Parkinson's disease locus influencing the expression of genes mediated by a protease that controls lysosomal function, and Alzheimer's disease loci influencing the expression of genes involved in type 1 interferon signaling, myeloid phagocytosis, and complement cascade pathways. Overall, we uncover gene networks in induced innate immune cells linked to disease associated genetic variants, which may help elucidate the underlying biology of disease.",PLoS Genet,2020
37837732,Protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum rescues Aβ toxicity in Drosophila.,"Amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In adult Drosophila brains, human Aβ overexpression harms climbing and lifespan. It's uncertain whether Aβ is intrinsically toxic or activates downstream neurodegeneration pathways. Our study uncovers a novel protective role against Aβ toxicity: intra-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein accumulation with a focus on laminin and collagen subunits. Despite high Aβ, laminin B1 (LanB1) overexpression robustly counters toxicity, suggesting a potential Aβ resistance mechanism. Other laminin subunits and collagen IV also alleviate Aβ toxicity; combining them with LanB1 augments the effect. Imaging reveals ER retention of LanB1 without altering Aβ secretion. LanB1's rescue function operates independently of the IRE1α/XBP1 ER stress response. ER-targeted GFP overexpression also mitigates Aβ toxicity, highlighting broader ER protein retention advantages. Proof-of-principle tests in murine hippocampal slices using mouse Lamb1 demonstrate ER retention in transduced cells, indicating a conserved mechanism. Though ER protein retention generally harms, it could paradoxically counter neuronal Aβ toxicity, offering a new therapeutic avenue for Alzheimer's disease.",Neurobiol Aging,2023
30581972,Retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness is nonlinearly associated with cognitive impairment in the community-dwelling elderly.,"INTRODUCTION: Thinning of optical coherence tomography-measured retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness has been found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the association of these retinal markers and cognition in nondemented elders may not be linear.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 227 community-dwelling elders (age 65+ years). Multivariable regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between retinal nerve fiber layer/GC-IPL and global/domain-specific cognition.
RESULTS: The performance of global cognition decreased as mean GC-IPL of bilateral eyes deviated from the sample mean (77.5 μm) (quadratic GC-IPL: β = -0.49 × 10<sup>-2</sup>; 95% confidence interval: -0.74 × 10<sup>-2</sup> to -0.23 × 10<sup>-2</sup>). Similar associations were also found for logical memory. No significant association was observed between retinal nerve fiber layer and cognition.
DISCUSSION: Either thinning or thickening of GC-IPL was associated with poor cognition in nondemented elderly (a U-shaped association). GC-IPL may serve as a noninvasive preclinical predictor of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),2018

25329012,Quantifying the eating abnormalities in frontotemporal dementia.,"IMPORTANCE: Presence of eating abnormalities is one of the core criteria for the diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), yet their occurrence in other subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and effect on metabolic health is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To define and quantify patterns of eating behavior and energy, sugar, carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake, as well as indices of metabolic health in patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia (SD) compared with patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and healthy control participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective case-controlled study involving patient and caregiver completion of surveys. Seventy-five participants with dementia (21 with bvFTD, 26 with SD, and 28 with AD) and 18 age- and education-matched healthy controls were recruited from FRONTIER, the FTD research clinic at Neuroscience Research Australia in Sydney.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Caregivers of patients with FTD and AD completed validated questionnaires on appetite, eating behaviors, energy consumption, and dietary macronutrient composition. All participants completed surveys on hunger and satiety. Body mass index and weight measurements were prospectively collected.
RESULTS: The bvFTD group had significant abnormalities in the domains of appetite (U = 111.0, z = 2.7, P = .007), eating habits (U = 69.5, z = 3.8, P = .001), food preferences (U = 57.0, z = 4.1, P = .001), swallowing (U = 109.0, z = 3.0, P = .003), and other oral behaviors (U = 141.0, z = 2.6, P = .009) compared with the AD group. The bvFTD and SD groups tended to have increased energy consumption. Compared with controls, the bvFTD group had significantly increased carbohydrate intake (251 vs 170 g/d; P = .05) and the SD group had significantly increased sugar intake (114 vs 76 g/d; P = .049). No significant differences in total fat or protein intake between the groups were found. Despite similar energy intake, the SD group had lower hunger and satiety scores compared with the bvFTD group. In contrast, hunger and satiety scores did not differ between the bvFTD group and controls. The abnormal eating behavior was found in the 2 groups (bvFTD and SD) with the highest body mass index (F = 4.2, P = .008) and waist circumference (F = 6.4, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Abnormal eating behaviors are prominent in patients with bvFTD and those with SD and are not limited to increased appetite. The observed higher intake of sugar and carbohydrates was found in patients with the FTD subtypes and those with higher body mass index and waist circumference and was not explained simply by increased hunger or lower satiety.",JAMA Neurol,2014
38123547,ANKS1A regulates LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated cerebrovascular clearance in brain endothelial cells.,"Brain endothelial LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is involved in the clearance of Aβ peptides across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here we show that endothelial deficiency of ankyrin repeat and SAM domain containing 1 A (ANKS1A) reduces both the cell surface levels of LRP1 and the Aβ clearance across the BBB. Association of ANKS1A with the NPXY motifs of LRP1 facilitates the transport of LRP1 from the endoplasmic reticulum toward the cell surface. ANKS1A deficiency in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model results in exacerbated Aβ pathology followed by cognitive impairments. These deficits are reversible by gene therapy with brain endothelial-specific ANKS1A. In addition, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived BBBs (iBBBs) were generated from endothelial cells lacking ANKS1A or carrying the rs6930932 variant. Those iBBBs exhibit both reduced cell surface LRP1 and impaired Aβ clearance. Thus, our findings demonstrate that ANKS1A regulates LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance across the BBB.",Nat Commun,2023
39521775,Multiplexed expansion revealing for imaging multiprotein nanostructures in healthy and diseased brain.,"Proteins work together in nanostructures in many physiological contexts and disease states. We recently developed expansion revealing (ExR), which expands proteins away from each other, in order to support better labeling with antibody tags and nanoscale imaging on conventional microscopes. Here, we report multiplexed expansion revealing (multiExR), which enables high-fidelity antibody visualization of >20 proteins in the same specimen, over serial rounds of staining and imaging. Across all datasets examined, multiExR exhibits a median round-to-round registration error of 39 nm, with a median registration error of 25 nm when the most stringent form of the protocol is used. We precisely map 23 proteins in the brain of 5xFAD Alzheimer's model mice, and find reductions in synaptic protein cluster volume, and co-localization of specific AMPA receptor subunits with amyloid-beta nanoclusters. We visualize 20 synaptic proteins in specimens of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. multiExR may be of broad use in analyzing how different kinds of protein are organized amidst normal and pathological processes in biology.",Nat Commun,2024

30419228,Learnings about the complexity of extracellular tau aid development of a blood-based screen for Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The tau protein plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is huge interest in measuring tau in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
METHODS: We developed a set of immunoassays to measure tau in specimens from humans diagnosed based on current best clinical and CSF biomarker criteria.
RESULTS: In CSF, mid-region- and N-terminal-detected tau predominated and rose in disease. In plasma, an N-terminal assay (NT1) detected elevated levels of tau in AD and AD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma NT1 measurements separated controls from AD-MCI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88) and AD (AUC = 0.96) in a discovery cohort and in a Validation Cohort (with AUCs = 0.79 and 0.75, respectively).
DISCUSSION: The forms of tau in CSF and plasma are distinct, but in each specimen type, the levels of certain fragments are increased in AD. Measurement of plasma NT1 tau should be aggressively pursued as a potential blood-based screening test for AD/AD-MCI.",Alzheimers Dement,2018
38332809,Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paired with cognitive training on cognitive function in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL Complete (EBSCO), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang Database were searched. The risk of bias was appraised through the Cochrane collaboration tool. A meta-analysis was conducted, including an assessment of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 408 participants were included. The addition of rTMS significantly improved overall cognition in patients compared with cognitive intervention alone (p &lt; 0.05 for all tests). The treatment also had some continuity, with significant improvements in cognitive function within weeks after the treatment ended (p &lt; 0.05 for all tests).
CONCLUSION: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training (rTMS-CT) is a valuable technique for the cognitive rehabilitation of AD patients. It is beneficial to improve the cognitive ability of patients and restore their overall functional state. The results of the study may provide a basis for clinical providers to implement interventions that facilitate the design of more rigorous and high-quality interventions.
LIMITATIONS: The number of studies and sample size in our study were small. We did not explore possible interactions between rTMS and medications and mood improvement after rTMS due to inadequate data.

37849026,The type-I interferon response potentiates seeded tau aggregation and exacerbates tau pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: Signatures of a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response are observed in the post mortem brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the effect of the IFN-I response on pathological tau accumulation remains unclear.
METHODS: We examined the effects of IFN-I signaling in primary neural culture models of seeded tau aggregation and P301S-tau transgenic mouse models in the context of genetic deletion of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR).
RESULTS: Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), a synthetic analog of viral nucleic acids, evoked a potent cytokine response that enhanced seeded aggregation of tau in an IFN-I-dependent manner. IFN-I-induced vulnerability could be pharmacologically prevented and was intrinsic to neurons. Aged P301S-tau mice lacking Ifnar1 had significantly reduced tau pathology compared to mice with intact IFN signaling.
DISCUSSION: We identify a critical role for IFN-I in potentiating tau aggregation. IFN-I is therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target in AD and other tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: Type-I IFN (IFN-I) promotes seeded tau aggregation in neural cultures. IFNAR inhibition prevents IFN-I driven sensitivity to tau aggregation. IFN-I driven vulnerability is intrinsic to neurons. Tau pathology is significantly reduced in aged P301S-tau mice lacking IFNAR.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
37990803,Empirically derived psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes in Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino older adults enrolled in HABS-HD: Associations with AD biomarkers and cognitive outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: Identification of psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes to understand within-group heterogeneity in risk and resiliency to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino older adults is essential for the implementation of precision health approaches.
METHODS: A cluster analysis was performed on baseline measures of socioeconomic resources (annual income, social support, occupational complexity) and psychiatric distress (chronic stress, depression, anxiety) for 1220 racially/ethnically minoritized adults enrolled in the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD). Analyses of covariance adjusting for sociodemographic factors examined phenotype differences in cognition and plasma AD biomarkers.
RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified (1) Low Resource/High Distress (n = 256); (2) High Resource/Low Distress (n = 485); and (3) Low Resource/Low Distress (n = 479) phenotypes. The Low Resource/High Distress phenotype displayed poorer cognition and higher plasma neurofilament light chain; differences between the High Resource/Low Distress and Low Resource/Low Distress phenotypes were minimal.
DISCUSSION: The identification of psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes within racially/ethnically minoritized older adults is crucial to the development of targeted AD prevention and intervention efforts.",Alzheimers Dement,2023
30232263,Differential effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial injury response and tauopathy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, as well as microgliosis. Hemizygous missense variants in Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with elevated risk for developing late-onset AD. These variants are hypothesized to result in loss of function, mimicking TREM2 haploinsufficiency. However, the consequences of TREM2 haploinsufficiency on tau pathology and microglial function remain unknown. We report the effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial function and tau-associated deficits. In vivo imaging revealed that microglia from aged TREM2-haploinsufficient mice show a greater impairment in their injury response compared with microglia from aged TREM2-KO mice. In transgenic mice expressing mutant human tau, TREM2 haploinsufficiency, but not complete loss of TREM2, increased tau pathology. In addition, whereas complete TREM2 deficiency protected against tau-mediated microglial activation and atrophy, TREM2 haploinsufficiency elevated expression of proinflammatory markers and exacerbated atrophy at a late stage of disease. The differential effects of partial and complete loss of TREM2 on microglial function and tau pathology provide important insights into the critical role of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2018
27636841,Perlecan Domain V Inhibits Amyloid-β Induced Activation of the α2β1 Integrin-Mediated Neurotoxic Signaling Cascade.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal death, neurofibrillary tangles, and senile plaques. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) is the major component of plaques and consists of two prominent isoforms, Aβ40 and Aβ42. As many risk factors for AD are vascular in origin and blood vessel defects in clearing Aβ from the brain are a potential key component of AD pathology, we have focused on the neuron-blood vessel interface, and in particular, the vascular basement membrane, which coats blood vessels and physically separates them from neurons. A prominent component of the vascular basement membrane is the extracellular matrix proteoglycan perlecan. Domain V (DV) is the C-terminal domain and is generated by perlecan proteolysis. DV interacts with the α2 integrin and Aβ is a ligand for both α2β1 and αvβ1. Due to the known interaction of DV with α2β1 and α2β1's requirement for Aβ deposition and neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that DV and/or its C-terminal domain, LG3, might alter neurotoxic signaling pathways by directly blocking or otherwise interfering with α2β1 binding by Aβ. Our study suggests that α2β1 mediates Aβ-induced activation of c-Jun and caspase-3, key components of the neurotoxic pathway, in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrate that DV and/or LG3 may therapeutically modulate these α2β1 mediated neurotoxic effects suggesting that they or other α2β1 integrin modulators could represent a novel approach to treat AD. Finally, our results suggest different neurotoxicity susceptibilities between cortical and hippocampal neurons to Aβ40 and Aβ42 as further underscored by differing neuroprotective potencies of LG3 in each cell type.",J Alzheimers Dis,2016
38036591,Low-dose brain radiation: lowering hyperphosphorylated-tau without increasing DNA damage or oncogenic activation.,"Brain radiation has been medically used to alter the metabolism of cancerous cells and induce their elimination. Rarely, though, brain radiation has been used to interfere with the pathomechanisms of non-cancerous brain disorders, especially neurodegenerative disorders. Data from low-dose radiation (LDR) on swine brains demonstrated reduced levels of phosphorylated-tau (CP13) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in radiated (RAD) versus sham (SH) animals. Phosphorylated-tau and APP are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We determined if the expression levels of hyperphosphorylated-tau, 3R-tau, 4R-tau, synaptic, intraneuronal damage, and DNA damage/oncogenic activation markers were altered in RAD versus SH swine brains. Quantitative analyses demonstrated reduced levels of AT8 and 3R-tau in hippocampus (H) and striatum (Str), increased levels of synaptophysin and PSD-95 in frontal cortex (FCtx), and reduced levels of NF-L in cerebellum (CRB) of RAD versus SH swine. DNA damage and oncogene activation markers levels did not differ between RAD and SH animals, except for histone-H3 (increased in FCtx and CRB, decreased in Str), and p53 (reduced in FCtx, Str, H and CRB). These findings confirm the region-based effects of sLDR on proteins normally expressed in larger mammalian brains and support the potential applicability of LDR to beneficially interfere against neurodegenerative mechanisms.",Sci Rep,2023
36538409,Safety and efficacy of plasma transfusion from exercise-trained donors in patients with early Alzheimer's disease: protocol for the ExPlas study.,"INTRODUCTION: Given that exercise training reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), induces changes in the blood composition and has widespread systemic benefits, it is reasonable to hypothesise that exercised plasma (ExPlas) may have rejuvenative properties. The main objective is to test safety and tolerability of transfusing ExPlas from young, healthy, fit adults to patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD. The study is a pilot for a future efficacy study. The key secondary objectives are examining the effect of plasma transfusions on cognitive function, fitness level, vascular risk profile, assessment of cerebral blood flow and hippocampal volume, quality of life, functional connectivity assessed by resting state functional MRI and biomarkers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: ExPlas is a double-blinded, randomised controlled clinical single-centre trial. Patients up to 75 years of age with diagnosis early symptomatic phase AD will be recruited from two Norwegian hospitals. ExPlas is plasma drawn by plasmapheresis once a month for 4 months, from a total of 30 fit male donors (aged 18-40, BMI≤27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and maximal oxygen uptake&gt;55 mL/kg/min). All units will be virus inactivated by the Intercept method in accordance with procedures at St. Olavs University Hospital. Comparison with isotonic saline allows differentiation from a non-blood product. The main study consists of 6 rounds of examinations in addition to 12 plasma transfusions divided over three 4-week periods during study year-1. It is also planned to conduct follow-up examinations 2 and 5 years after baseline ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants and participation is voluntary. All participants have a next of kin who will follow them throughout the study to represent the patient's interest. The study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK 2018/702) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency (EudraCT No. 2018-000148-24). The study will be published in an open access journal and results will be presented at numerous national and international meetings as well as on social media platforms.

30553154,Influence of hypertension on brain amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's disease signature neurodegeneration.,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship of hypertension with beta-amyloid (Aβ) and neurodegeneration biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the modulating effect of apolipoprotein E-ε4 (APOE4). In total, 259 cognitively normal (CN) and 79 AD dementia older adults received clinical assessments including the evaluation for the presence of hypertension, [<sup>11</sup>C]-Pittsburgh-compound-B-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and APOE genotyping. We used a clinical stage-specific approach, separately focusing on CN and AD dementia stages. For the CN group, individuals with hypertension showed reduced AD signature cortical thickness compared with those without hypertension. Subsequent subgroup analyses showed that hypertension was associated with reduced AD signature cortical thickness only in APOE4 noncarriers, whereas hypertension was associated with elevated Aβ deposition in APOE4 carriers. Meanwhile, regardless of APOE4 status, AD dementia patients with hypertension had significantly lower Aβ deposition than those without hypertension. In conclusion, the findings suggest that hypertension contributes to AD primarily through the reduction of brain reserve. In case of APOE4 carriers, however, hypertension seems to additionally facilitate AD process through amyloid-dependent pathway.",Neurobiol Aging,2018
34961762,Patch individual filter layers in CNNs to harness the spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data.,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-as a type of deep learning-have been specifically designed for highly heterogeneous data, such as natural images. Neuroimaging data, however, is comparably homogeneous due to (1) the uniform structure of the brain and (2) additional efforts to spatially normalize the data to a standard template using linear and non-linear transformations. To harness spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data, we suggest here a new CNN architecture that combines the idea of hierarchical abstraction in CNNs with a prior on the spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data. Whereas early layers are trained globally using standard convolutional layers, we introduce patch individual filters (PIF) for higher, more abstract layers. By learning filters in individual latent space patches without sharing weights, PIF layers can learn abstract features faster and specific to regions. We thoroughly evaluated PIF layers for three different tasks and data sets, namely sex classification on UK Biobank data, Alzheimer's disease detection on ADNI data and multiple sclerosis detection on private hospital data, and compared it with two baseline models, a standard CNN and a patch-based CNN. We obtained two main results: First, CNNs using PIF layers converge consistently faster, measured in run time in seconds and number of iterations than both baseline models. Second, both the standard CNN and the PIF model outperformed the patch-based CNN in terms of balanced accuracy and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) with a maximal balanced accuracy (ROC AUC) of 94.21% (99.10%) for the sex classification task (PIF model), and 81.24% and 80.48% (88.89% and 87.35%) respectively for the Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis detection tasks (standard CNN model). In conclusion, we demonstrated that CNNs using PIF layers result in faster convergence while obtaining the same predictive performance as a standard CNN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces a prior in form of an inductive bias to harness spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data.",Sci Rep,2021
33523132,A gene-level methylome-wide association analysis identifies novel Alzheimer's disease genes.,"MOTIVATION: Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have successfully facilitated the discovery of novel genetic risk loci for many complex traits, including late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most existing TWAS methods rely only on gene expression and ignore epigenetic modification (i.e., DNA methylation) and functional regulatory information (i.e., enhancer-promoter interactions), both of which contribute significantly to the genetic basis of AD.
RESULTS: We develop a novel gene-level association testing method that integrates genetically regulated DNA methylation and enhancer-target gene pairs with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary results. Through simulations, we show that our approach, referred to as the CMO (cross methylome omnibus) test, yielded well controlled type I error rates and achieved much higher statistical power than competing methods under a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, compared with TWAS, CMO identified an average of 124% more associations when analyzing several brain imaging-related GWAS results. By analyzing to date the largest AD GWAS of 71,880 cases and 383,378 controls, CMO identified six novel loci for AD, which have been ignored by competing methods.

20603481,Temporal course of depressive symptoms during the development of Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize change in depressive symptoms before and after the onset of dementia in Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHOD: We used data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of risk factors for AD in a geographically defined population of old people. Two subsets were analyzed. In 357 individuals who developed incident AD during the study, self-report of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) was obtained at 3-year intervals for a mean of 8 to 9 years. In 340 individuals who agreed to annual data collection, informant report of depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) was obtained for a mean of 3 years after a diagnosis of AD (n = 107), mild cognitive impairment (n = 81), or no cognitive impairment (n = 152).
RESULTS: The incident AD group reported a barely perceptible increase in depressive symptoms during 6 to 7 years of observation before the diagnosis (0.04 symptoms per year) and no change during 2 to 3 years of observation after the diagnosis except for a slight decrease in positive affect. In those with annual follow-up, neither AD nor its precursor, mild cognitive impairment, was associated with change in informant report of depressive symptoms during a mean of 3 years of observation.
CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms show little change during the development and progression of AD to a moderate level of dementia severity.",Neurology,2010

31921305,A Rat Model of Human Behavior Provides Evidence of Natural Selection Against Underexpression of Aggressiveness-Related Genes in Humans.,"Aggressiveness is a hereditary behavioral pattern that forms a social hierarchy and affects the individual social rank and accordingly quality and duration of life. Thus, genome-wide studies of human aggressiveness are important. Nonetheless, the aggressiveness-related genome-wide studies have been conducted on animals rather than humans. Recently, in our genome-wide study, we uncovered natural selection against underexpression of human aggressiveness-related genes and proved it using F1 hybrid mice. Simultaneously, this natural selection equally supports two opposing traits in humans (dominance and subordination) as if self-domestication could have happened with its disruptive natural selection. Because there is still not enough scientific evidence that this could happen, here, we verified this natural selection pattern using quantitative PCR and two outbred rat lines (70 generations of artificial selection for aggressiveness or tameness, hereinafter: domestication). We chose seven genes-Cacna2d3, Gad2, Gria2, Mapk1, Nos1, Pomc, and Syn1-over- or underexpression of which corresponds to aggressive or domesticated behavior (in humans or mice) that has the same direction as natural selection. Comparing aggressive male rats with domesticated ones, we found that these genes are overexpressed statistically significantly in the hypothalamus (as a universal behavior regulator), not in the periaqueductal gray, where there was no aggressiveness-related expression of the genes in males. Database STRING showed statistically significant associations of the human genes homologous to these rat genes with long-term depression, circadian entrainment, Alzheimer's disease, and the central nervous system disorders during chronic IL-6 overexpression. This finding more likely supports positive perspectives of further studies on self-domestication syndromes.",Front Genet,2019
27752775,eEF2K inhibition blocks Aβ42 neurotoxicity by promoting an NRF2 antioxidant response.,"Soluble oligomers of amyloid-β (Aβ) impair synaptic plasticity, perturb neuronal energy homeostasis, and are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Therefore, significant efforts in AD drug discovery research aim to prevent the formation of Aβ oligomers or block their neurotoxicity. The eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, and couples neurotransmission to local dendritic mRNA translation. Recent evidence indicates that Aβ oligomers activate neuronal eEF2K, suggesting a potential link to Aβ induced synaptic dysfunction. However, a detailed understanding of the role of eEF2K in AD pathogenesis, and therapeutic potential of eEF2K inhibition in AD, remain to be determined. Here, we show that eEF2K activity is increased in postmortem AD patient cortex and hippocampus, and in the hippocampus of aged transgenic AD mice. Furthermore, eEF2K inhibition using pharmacological or genetic approaches prevented the toxic effects of Aβ42 oligomers on neuronal viability and dendrite formation in vitro. We also report that eEF2K inhibition promotes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) antioxidant response in neuronal cells, which was crucial for the beneficial effects of eEF2K inhibition in neurons exposed to Aβ42 oligomers. Accordingly, NRF2 knockdown or overexpression of the NRF2 inhibitor, Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein-1 (Keap1), significantly attenuated the neuroprotection associated with eEF2K inhibition. Finally, genetic deletion of the eEF2K ortholog efk-1 reduced oxidative stress, and improved chemotaxis and serotonin sensitivity in C. elegans expressing human Aβ42 in neurons. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential utility of eEF2K inhibition to reduce Aβ-mediated oxidative stress in AD.",Acta Neuropathol,2016
26302439,Nerve Growth Factor Gene Therapy: Activation of Neuronal Responses in Alzheimer Disease.,"IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and lacks effective disease-modifying therapies. In 2001, we initiated a clinical trial of nerve growth factor (NGF) gene therapy in AD, the first effort at gene delivery in an adult neurodegenerative disorder. This program aimed to determine whether a nervous system growth factor prevents or reduces cholinergic neuronal degeneration in patients with AD. We present postmortem findings in 10 patients with survival times ranging from 1 to 10 years after treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether degenerating neurons in AD retain an ability to respond to a nervous system growth factor delivered after disease onset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients in this anatomicopathological study were enrolled in clinical trials from March 2001 to October 2012 at the University of California, San Diego, Medical Center in La Jolla. Ten patients with early AD underwent NGF gene therapy using ex vivo or in vivo gene transfer. The brains of all 8 patients in the first phase 1 ex vivo trial and of 2 patients in a subsequent phase 1 in vivo trial were examined.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brains were immunolabeled to evaluate in vivo gene expression, cholinergic neuronal responses to NGF, and activation of NGF-related cell signaling. In 2 patients, NGF protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Among 10 patients, degenerating neurons in the AD brain responded to NGF. All patients exhibited a trophic response to NGF in the form of axonal sprouting toward the NGF source. Comparing treated and nontreated sides of the brain in 3 patients who underwent unilateral gene transfer, cholinergic neuronal hypertrophy occurred on the NGF-treated side (P < .05). Activation of cellular signaling and functional markers was present in 2 patients who underwent adeno-associated viral vectors (serotype 2)-mediated NGF gene transfer. Neurons exhibiting tau pathology and neurons free of tau expressed NGF, indicating that degenerating cells can be infected with therapeutic genes, with resultant activation of cell signaling. No adverse pathological effects related to NGF were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings indicate that neurons of the degenerating brain retain the ability to respond to growth factors with axonal sprouting, cell hypertrophy, and activation of functional markers. Sprouting induced by NGF persists for 10 years after gene transfer. Growth factor therapy appears safe over extended periods and merits continued testing as a means of treating neurodegenerative disorders.",JAMA Neurol,2015
33074225,Reduction of Dendritic Inhibition in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons in Amyloidosis Models of Early Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: In an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), before the formation of amyloid plaques, neuronal network hyperactivity has been reported in both patients and animal models. This suggests an underlying disturbance of the balance between excitation and inhibition. Several studies have highlighted the role of somatic inhibition in early AD, while less is known about dendritic inhibition.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated how inhibitory synaptic currents are affected by elevated Aβ levels.
METHODS: We performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures after treatment with Aβ-oligomers and in hippocampal brain slices from AppNL-F-G mice (APP-KI).
RESULTS: We found a reduction of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices after 24 h Aβ treatment. sIPSCs with slow rise times were reduced, suggesting a specific loss of dendritic inhibitory inputs. As miniature IPSCs and synaptic density were unaffected, these results suggest a decrease in activity-dependent transmission after Aβ treatment. We observed a similar, although weaker, reduction in sIPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons from APP-KI mice compared to control. When separated by sex, the strongest reduction in sIPSC frequency was found in slices from male APP-KI mice. Consistent with hyperexcitability in pyramidal cells, dendritically targeting interneurons received slightly more excitatory input. GABAergic action potentials had faster kinetics in APP-KI slices.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that Aβ affects dendritic inhibition via impaired action potential driven release, possibly due to altered kinetics of GABAergic action potentials. Reduced dendritic inhibition may contribute to neuronal hyperactivity in early AD.",J Alzheimers Dis,2020
35654956,"Faulty autolysosome acidification in Alzheimer's disease mouse models induces autophagic build-up of Aβ in neurons, yielding senile plaques.","Autophagy is markedly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we reveal unique autophagy dysregulation within neurons in five AD mouse models in vivo and identify its basis using a neuron-specific transgenic mRFP-eGFP-LC3 probe of autophagy and pH, multiplex confocal imaging and correlative light electron microscopy. Autolysosome acidification declines in neurons well before extracellular amyloid deposition, associated with markedly lowered vATPase activity and build-up of Aβ/APP-βCTF selectively within enlarged de-acidified autolysosomes. In more compromised yet still intact neurons, profuse Aβ-positive autophagic vacuoles (AVs) pack into large membrane blebs forming flower-like perikaryal rosettes. This unique pattern, termed PANTHOS (poisonous anthos (flower)), is also present in AD brains. Additional AVs coalesce into peri-nuclear networks of membrane tubules where fibrillar β-amyloid accumulates intraluminally. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization, cathepsin release and lysosomal cell death ensue, accompanied by microglial invasion. Quantitative analyses confirm that individual neurons exhibiting PANTHOS are the principal source of senile plaques in amyloid precursor protein AD models.",Nat Neurosci,2022
38050662,Tau-neurodegeneration mismatch reveals vulnerability and resilience to comorbidities in Alzheimer's continuum.,"INTRODUCTION: Variability in relationship of tau-based neurofibrillary tangles (T) and neurodegeneration (N) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from non-specific nature of N, modulated by non-AD co-pathologies, age-related changes, and resilience factors.
METHODS: We used regional T-N residual patterns to partition 184 patients within the Alzheimer's continuum into data-driven groups. These were compared with groups from 159 non-AD (amyloid ""negative"") patients partitioned using cortical thickness, and groups in 98 patients with ante mortem MRI and post mortem tissue for measuring N and T, respectively. We applied the initial T-N residual model to classify 71 patients in an independent cohort into predefined groups.
RESULTS: AD groups displayed spatial T-N mismatch patterns resembling neurodegeneration patterns in non-AD groups, similarly associated with non-AD factors and diverging cognitive outcomes. In the autopsy cohort, limbic T-N mismatch correlated with TDP-43 co-pathology.
DISCUSSION: T-N mismatch may provide a personalized approach for determining non-AD factors associated with resilience/vulnerability in AD.",Alzheimers Dement,2023

To deal with this growing demographic and ethical crisis, patients with dementia need to plan for their future medical care while they have capacity to do so. This article will examine the role of each member of the dementia care triad and how to empower the patient to participate in planning future medical care. A case will be made that physicians have the same professional disclosure obligations to dementia patients as they do to all other capable patients with terminal illnesses.

20625167,"Serial MRI and CSF biomarkers in normal aging, MCI, and AD.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the annual change in MRI and CSF biomarkers in cognitively normal (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer disease (AD). Comparisons were based on intergroup discrimination, correlation with concurrent cognitive/functional changes, relationships to APOE genotype, and sample sizes for clinical trials.
METHODS: We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study consisting of CN, aMCI, and AD cohorts with both baseline and 12-month follow-up CSF and MRI. The annual change in CSF (total-tau [t-tau], Abeta(1-42)) and MRI (change in ventricular volume) was obtained in 312 subjects (92 CN, 149 aMCI, 71 AD).
RESULTS: There was no significant average annual change in either CSF biomarker in any clinical group except t-tau in CN; moreover, the annual change did not differ by clinical group in pairwise comparisons. In contrast, annual increase in ventricular volume increased in the following order, AD > aMCI > CN, and differences were significant between all clinical groups in pairwise comparisons. Ventricular volume increase correlated with concurrent worsening on cognitive/functional indices in aMCI and AD whereas evidence of a similar correlation with change in CSF measures was unclear. The annual changes in MRI differed by APOE epsilon4 status overall and among aMCI while annual changes in CSF biomarkers did not. Estimated sample sizes for clinical trials are notably less for MRI than the CSF or clinical measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the CSF biomarkers evaluated, changes in serial structural MRI are correlated with concurrent change on general cognitive and functional indices in impaired subjects, track with clinical disease stage, and are influenced by APOE genotype.",Neurology,2010
36278353,Associations of Naturally Occurring Antibodies to Presenilin-1 with Brain Amyloid-β Load and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) promotes the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin-1 (PS1) is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, which is involved in the process of Aβ production. The profiles of autoantibodies are dysregulated in AD patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relative levels and clinical relevance of naturally occurring antibodies to PS1 (NAbs-PS1) in AD.
METHODS: A total of 55 subjects with AD (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to AD), 28 subjects with cognitive impairment (including both dementia and mild cognitive impairment) not due to AD (non-AD CI), and 70 cognitively normal (CN) subjects were recruited. One-site ELISA was utilized to determine the relative levels of NAbs-PS1 in plasma.
RESULTS: AD subjects had lower plasma levels of NAbs-PS1 than CN and non-AD CI subjects. Plasma NAbs-PS1 were negatively associated with the brain Aβ load, as reflected by PET-PiB SUVR, and were positively associated with cognitive functions of participants. Plasma NAbs-PS1 discriminated AD patients from CN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.730, a sensitivity of 69.09%, and a specificity of 67.14%, and they discriminated AD patients from non-AD CI subjects with an AUC of 0.750, a specificity of 70.91%, and a sensitivity of 71.43%.

39678342,Ancestral Genomic Functional Differences in Oligodendroglia: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to elucidate ancestry-specific changes to the genomic regulatory architecture in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendroglia, focusing on their implications for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work addresses the lack of diversity in previous iPSC studies by including ancestries that contribute to African American (European/African) and Hispanic/Latino populations (Amerindian/African/European).
METHODS: We generated 12 iPSC lines-four African, four Amerindian, and four European- from both AD patients and non-cognitively impaired individuals, with varying APOE genotypes (APOE3/3 and APOE4/4). These lines were differentiated into neural spheroids containing oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing were employed to analyze transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiles, respectively. Differential gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and Hi-C analyses were conducted, followed by pathway analysis to interpret the results.
RESULTS: We identified ancestry-specific differences in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Notably, numerous AD GWAS-associated genes were differentially expressed across ancestries. The largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in European vs. Amerindian and African vs. Amerindian iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Pathway analysis of APOE4/4 carriers vs APOE3/3 carriers exhibited upregulation of a large number of disease and metabolic pathways in APOE4/4 individuals of all ancestries. Of particular interest was that APOE4/4 carriers had significantly upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis genes relative to APOE3/3 individuals across all ancestries, strongest in iOPCs. Comparison of iOPC and iOL transcriptome data with corresponding human frontal cortex data demonstrated a high correlation (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.85).
CONCLUSIONS: This research emphasizes the importance of including diverse ancestries in AD research to uncover critical gene expression differences between populations and ancestries that may influence disease susceptibility and therapeutic interventions. The upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in APOE4/4 carriers of all three ancestries supports the concept that APOE4 may produce disease effects early in life, which could have therapeutic implications as we move forward towards specific therapy for APOE4 carriers. These findings and the high correlation between brain and iPSC-derived OPC and OL transcriptomes support the relevance of this approach as a model for disease study.",Res Sq,2024
33843952,Extension of Mendelian Randomization to Identify Earliest Manifestations of Alzheimer Disease: Association of Genetic Risk Score for Alzheimer Disease With Lower Body Mass Index by Age 50 Years.,"Weight loss or lower body mass index (BMI) could be an early symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD), but when this begins to emerge is difficult to estimate with traditional observational data. In an extension of Mendelian randomization, we leveraged variation in genetic risk for late-onset AD risk to estimate the causal effect of AD on BMI and the earliest ages at which AD-related weight loss (or lower BMI as a proxy) occurs. We studied UK Biobank participants enrolled in 2006-2010, who were without dementia, aged 39-73, with European genetic ancestry. BMI was calculated with measured height/weight (weight (kg)/height (m)2). An AD genetic risk score (AD-GRS) was calculated based on 23 genetic variants. Using linear regressions, we tested the association of AD-GRS with BMI, stratified by decade, and calculated the age of divergence in BMI trends between low and high AD-GRS. AD-GRS was not associated with BMI in 39- to 49-year-olds (β = 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.03, 0.03). AD-GRS was associated with lower BMI in 50- to 59-year-olds (β = -0.03, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.01) and 60- to 73-year-olds (β = -0.09, 95% CI:-0.12, -0.07). Model-based BMI age curves for high versus low AD-GRS began to diverge after age 47 years. Sensitivity analyses found no evidence for pleiotropy or survival bias. Longitudinal replication is needed; however, our findings suggest that AD genes might begin to reduce BMI decades prior to dementia diagnosis.",Am J Epidemiol,2021
27358062,A loss of function variant in CASP7 protects against Alzheimer's disease in homozygous APOE ε4 allele carriers.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common form of dementia in elder populations with approximately 30 million cases worldwide. Genome wide genotyping and sequencing studies have identified many genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). While most of these variants are associated with increased risk of developing LOAD, only limited number of reports focused on variants that are protective against the disease.
METHODS: Here we applied a novel approach to uncover protective alleles against AD by analyzing genetic and phenotypic data in Mount Sinai Biobank and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) databases.
RESULTS: We discovered a likely loss-of-function small deletion variant in the caspase 7 (CASP7) gene associated with significantly reduced incidence of LOAD in carriers of the high-risk APOE ε4 allele. Further investigation of four independent cohorts of European ancestry revealed the protective effect of the CASP7 variant against AD is most significant in homozygous APOE ε4 allele carriers. Meta analysis of multiple datasets shows overall odds ratio = 0.45 (p = 0.004). Analysis of RNA sequencing derived gene expression data indicated the variant correlates with reduced caspase 7 expression in multiple brain tissues we examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that caspase 7 plays a key role in microglial activation driving neuro-degeneration during AD pathogenesis, and may explain the underlying genetic mechanisms that anti-inflammatory interventions in AD show greater benefit in APOE ε4 carriers than non-carriers. Our findings inform potential novel therapeutic opportunities for AD and warrant further investigations.",BMC Genomics,2016
