40023055,Event-related potential markers of subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment during a sustained visuo-attentive task.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease stages lack well-defined electrophysiological correlates, creating a critical gap in the identification of robust biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. In this study, we analysed event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a sustained visual attention task in a cohort of 178 individuals (119 SCD, 40 MCI, and 19 healthy subjects, HS) to investigate sensory and cognitive processing alterations associated with these conditions. SCD patients exhibited significant attenuation in both sensory (P1, N1, P2) and cognitive (P300, P600, P900) components compared to HS, with cognitive components showing performance-related gains. In contrast, MCI patients did not show a further decrease in any ERP component compared to SCD. Instead, they exhibited compensatory enhancements, reversing the downward trend observed in SCD. This compensation resulted in a non-monotonic pattern of ERP alterations across clinical conditions, suggesting that MCI patients engage neural mechanisms to counterbalance sensory and cognitive deficits. These findings support the use of electrophysiological markers in support of medical decision-making, enhancing personalized prognosis and guiding targeted interventions in cognitive decline.",Neuroimage Clin
40124420,Inhibition of Mitochondrial Dynamics by Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor-1 Suppresses Cell Migration and Metastatic Markers in Colorectal Cancer HCT116 Cells.,"INTRODUCTION: The mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. The mitochondrial morphology and spatial distribution within the cell is determined by fusion and fission processes of mitochondria. Several studies have used mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi.1) to explore the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in various pathological conditions, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and cancers.
PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the invasiveness of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced toxicity in HCT116 cells. Wound healing, cell migration and colony forming assays were adopted to measure the migration and invasion activity of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced mitochondrial mass quantification, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species generation in HCT116 cells. Additionally, Western Blot analysis was used to determine the expression level of Drp1, p-Drp1, Mnf2, AMPK-α, p-AMPK-α, Cox-2, iNos and MMP9 in HCT116 cells.
RESULTS: We found that Mdivi.1 induced toxicity and altered the morphology of HCT116 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Mdivi.1 significantly increased mitochondrial mass and dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, Mdivi.1 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial superoxide production, leading to AMPK activation. Moreover, Mdivi.1 decreased dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) and phosphorylated-Drp1 expression and increased mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) expression in a concentration-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h post-treatment. Notably, Mdivi.1 induced inhibition of translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mdivi.1 significantly suppressed the invasion and migration of HCT116 cells and inhibited the formation of HCT116 cell colonies. In addition, Mdivi.1 significantly decreased the expression of metastatic markers including Cox-2, iNos, and MMP-9 in HCT116 cells.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study revealed that Mdivi.1 downregulates Drp1, upregulates Mfn2, and increases mitochondrial mass with attenuated oxidative metabolism, leading to the inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. Mitochondrial dynamics are regarded as possible drug targets for interrupting colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis.",J Exp Pharmacol
40042444,Assessing Co-Localization of ITM2B With Alzheimer's Disease and Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy Neuropathologic Changes.,"Mutations in the Integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B) gene are linked to the development of familial British and Danish dementias, two relatively early-onset dementia disorders known also to be associated with Tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, to date, the involvement of ITM2B in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) remains unclear. To address this question, we used brain samples from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center community-based autopsy cohort. We investigated the patterns and co-localizations of ITM2B immunohistochemistry in subiculum, CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus from brains with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC), LATE-NC, and comorbid ADNC+LATE-NC, as well as low-pathology controls (n = 4 per disease state). There was frequent co-localization between ITM2B protein and intracellular Tau pathology in ADNC; however, there was a far weaker rate of co-localization between ITM2B and TDP-43 pathology. There also was, as previously described, an association between ITM2B immunostaining and neuritic-appearing amyloid plaques. Additionally, co-localization of intracellular ITM2B pathology with Thioflavin-S in NFTs suggested a potential role for ITM2B in marking neurons undergoing transition from relatively healthy (early NFT-bearing cells) to more severely affected (later NFT-bearing) cellular disease states. This study indicates that ITM2B has a relatively specific pattern of involvement in Tau-related neurodegeneration and in neuritic amyloid plaques, while implying minimal, if any, role for ITM2B in the synergistic relationship between Tau and TDP-43 pathologies.",Neuropathology
40128481,Excessive Alcohol Use as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer's Disease: Epidemiological and Preclinical Evidence.,"Alcohol use has recently emerged as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which alcohol interacts with AD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this chapter, we review the epidemiological and preclinical support for the interaction between alcohol use and AD. We hypothesize that alcohol use increases the rate of accumulation of specific AD-relevant pathologies during the prodromal phase and exacerbates dementia onset and progression. We find that alcohol consumption rates are increasing in adolescence, middle age, and aging populations. In tandem, rates of AD are also on the rise, potentially as a result of this increased alcohol use throughout the lifespan. We then review the biological processes in common between alcohol use disorder and AD as a means to uncover potential mechanisms by which they interact; these include oxidative stress, neuroimmune function, metabolism, pathogenic tauopathy development and spread, and neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance (EIB). Finally, we provide some forward-thinking suggestions we believe this field should consider. In particular, the inclusion of alcohol use assessments in longitudinal studies of AD and more preclinical studies on alcohol's impacts using better animal models of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).",Adv Exp Med Biol
39975923,Lower Network Functional Connectivity Is Associated With Higher Regional Tau Burden Among Those At-Risk of Alzheimer's Disease But Cognitively Unimpaired: Specific Patterns Based on Amyloid Status.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional connectivity within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and default mode network (DMN) changes across Alzheimer's disease stages, influenced by and influencing cortical amyloid-beta (Aβ) and regional tau burden. Previous research highlights functional connectivity's role in Alzheimer's disease progression and the interactions of cortical Aβ and functional connectivity within and between the MTL and DMN, but their impact on regional tau deposition remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired participants from OASIS-3 (AV1451 cohort, n=287) were classified into Aβ- (n=193) and Aβ+ (n=94) groups via amyloid-PET for cross-sectional analyses. Principal components analysis of functional connectivity identified two MTL-functional connectivity and DMN-functional connectivity principal components (PCs), which were correlated with regional tau per Braak stages 1-6 brain regions. Aβ status-specific robust regressions evaluated whether functional connectivity was associated with tau.
RESULTS: In Aβ- participants, lower ""MTL Integration Axis"" functional connectivity (PC1) was associated with higher tau levels in the left entorhinal cortex. In Aβ+ participants, lower ""MTL Integration Axis"" functional connectivity correlated with elevated tau levels in the DMN's left lateral parietal cortex, MTL's right parahippocampal cortex, and Braak stages 3-6 brain regions.
DISCUSSION: Decreased functional connectivity was associated with increased regional tau burden, showing Aβ status-specific effects. Enhancing MTL functional connectivity could be a therapeutic strategy and a promising direction for future clinical interventions.",Res Sq

39988819,Hericium erinaceus: A possible future therapeutic treatment for the prevention and delayed progression of Alzheimer's disease? - A Narrative Review.,"At present, the treatment of Alzheimer's disease involves only symptomatic medications which have continually demonstrated little efficacy, primarily due to the presence of biological barriers. Despite efforts, researchers have yet to discover a therapeutic treatment that delays neurodegenerative progression or restores associated Alzheimer neuropathological processes. For centuries, Hericium erinaceus (HE) has been used predominantly in Asian countries for its culinary and medicinal purposes, however, the use of this mushroom has not yet been utilised in western pharmacology. This review systematically investigates evidence pertaining to the use of HE as a potential future therapeutic treatment for the prevention and delayed progression of Alzheimer's disease, by highlighting any fundamental neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. In total, 3 human clinical trials and 13 animal-model studies were included for review. The use of HE demonstrated positive significant differences in results obtained from behavioural, histological, and biochemical assessments from both human clinical trials and animal model studies accentuating its utility for the improvement of cognitive function. In addition, erinacine A enriched HE appears to demonstrate the highest bioactive potency of all HE extracted compounds providing the greatest effects, while also evidencing transportability ease across biological barriers. In conclusion, evidence suggests that an intake of HE may be an appropriate and relevant future therapeutic treatment for the prevention and delayed progression of Alzheimer's disease, however, continued research is necessary to provide increased significant evidence of this relationship, most likely through the increased quantity of human clinical trials.",Nutr Res Rev
40125336,The effects of coagulation factors on the risk of Alzheimer's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies indicate a complex relationship between coagulation factors and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the current findings are inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether a causal relationship exists.
OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal relationships between blood levels of coagulation factors and AD risk.
METHODS: Eleven coagulation factors with valid instrumental variables available were evaluated. Two independent cohorts of European ancestry with AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were used: UK Biobank (UKB, N = 472,868) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP, N = 63,926). We primarily conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using the Inverse variance weighted (IVW). Meanwhile, the MR-Egger intercept test is used to detect horizontal pleiotropy, the Residual Sum of Squares observed (RSSobs) is used to assess the model's goodness of fit, and the leave-one-out analysis is employed for sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Using IVW analysis, the UKB database shows positive correlations of Protein C (PC, p = 0.002), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT, p = 0.019), and coagulation factor X (FX, p = 0.032) with AD, and a negative association for coagulation factor XI (FXI, p = 0.021). The IGAP database mirrors these findings for PC and FXI but not for the others. Leave-one-out analysis showed an anomaly after a single single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) driving, yet the overall results remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that elevated levels of PC, FX, and aPTT, along with reduced levels of FXI, are causally associated with an increased risk of AD. These findings might pave the way for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

The review concludes by addressing the challenges faced and emphasizes the significant potential of clinical trials in enhancing drug delivery and future prospects in the development of nanotechnology- based therapeutics for CNS disorders.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the therapeutic potential of nanomedicine in CNS disorder treatment is vast, instilling optimism for the creation of safe and effective therapies for these devastating conditions.",Curr Pharm Des
40034519,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) in multiple sclerosis (MS): A systematic review of published cases, mechanistic links between AD and MS, and possible clinical evaluation of AD in MS.","Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are two neurological disorders that can pose enormous burden to a person's quality of life. Due to new therapeutic advancements that significantly extend the lifespan, there may be an increased prevalence of AD in elderly MS patients. Objective: Building on a previous review on MS-AD coexistence, this review not only aimed to broaden the pool of literature searched, but also investigated possible mechanistic links between clinical markers for MS and AD. Methods: We searched for newly reported cases of coexisting MS and AD in PubMed, Clinical Key, BioMed Central, and Europe PubMed Central databases; and identified 101 new cases in addition to the previously reported 24 cases by Luczynski et al. (2019). The resulting 125 comorbid cases necessitated an evaluation of literature on the pathogenesis of MS and AD. Results: This review highlights many overlaps between AD and MS (for instance, the immune cell dysfunction, glymphatic dysfunction, genetics, environmental factors, and others). We critically evaluated clinical and laboratory metrics used to identify AD in MS patients (e.g., MRI, amyloid-β and tau protein identification, miRNA biomarker evaluation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, vitamin levels, gut microbiota etc.). Conclusions: Future research should refine these diagnostic criteria and focus on enhancing screening and detection methods for AD in MS patients. Furthermore, one should also investigate the primary causes of the increased comorbidity between AD and MS.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40161995,Multimodal MRI accurately identifies amyloid status in unbalanced cohorts in Alzheimer's disease continuum.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in conjunction with hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the form of neurofibrillary tangles are the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. It is well-known that the identification of individuals with Aβ positivity could enable early diagnosis. In this work, we aim at capturing the Aβ positivity status in an unbalanced cohort enclosing subjects at different disease stages, exploiting the underlying structural and connectivity disease-induced modulations as revealed by structural, functional, and diffusion MRI. Of note, due to the unbalanced cohort, the outcomes may be guided by those factors rather than amyloid accumulation. The partial views provided by each modality are integrated in the model, allowing to take full advantage of their complementarity in encoding the effects of the Aβ accumulation, leading to an accuracy of 0.762 ± 0.04. The specificity of the information brought by each modality is assessed by post hoc explainability analysis (guided backpropagation), highlighting the underlying structural and functional changes. Noteworthy, well-established biomarker key regions related to Aβ deposition could be identified by all modalities, including the hippocampus, thalamus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus, witnessing in favor of the reliability of the method as well as its potential in shedding light on modality-specific possibly unknown Aβ deposition signatures.",Netw Neurosci
40120962,Humanized rodent models of neurodegenerative diseases and other brain disorders.,"Central Nervous System (CNS) diseases significantly affect human health. However, replicating the onset, progression, and pathology of these diseases in rodents is challenging. To address this issue, researchers have developed humanized animal models. These models introduce human genes or cells into rodents. As a result, rodents become more suitable for studying human CNS diseases and their therapies in vivo. This review explores the preparation protocols, pathological and behavioral characteristics, benefits, significance, and limitations of humanized rodent models in researching various CNS diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glial cells-related CNS diseases, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor encephalitis, and others. Humanized rodent models have expanded the opportunities for in vivo exploration of human neurodegenerative diseases, other brain disorders, and their treatments. We can enhance translational research on CNS disorders by developing, investigating, and utilizing these models.",Neurosci Biobehav Rev
40048429,Astrocyte glypican 5 regulates synapse maturation and stabilization.,"The maturation and stabilization of appropriate synaptic connections is a vital step in neural circuit development; however, the molecular signals underlying these processes are not fully understood. We show that astrocytes, through production of glypican 5 (GPC5), are required for maturation and refinement of synapses in the mouse cortex during the critical period. In the absence of astrocyte GPC5, thalamocortical synapses show structural immaturity, including smaller presynaptic terminals, decreased postsynaptic density area, and presence of more postsynaptic partners at multisynaptic connections. This structural immaturity is accompanied by a delay in developmental incorporation of GLUA2-containing AMPARs at intracortical synapses. The functional impact of this is that mice lacking astrocyte GPC5 exhibit increased levels of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood. This demonstrates that astrocyte GPC5 is necessary for maturation and stabilization of synaptic connections, which has implications for disorders with altered synaptic function where GPC5 levels are altered, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",Cell Rep
40021076,Partial reprogramming by cyclical overexpression of Yamanaka factors improves pathological phenotypes of tauopathy mouse model of human Alzheimer's disease.,"Partial reprogramming induced by the controlled and cyclical overexpression of Yamanaka factors in the nervous system has so far succeeded in reversing some aging-associated phenotypes, such as improving memory function. These promising results suggest that partial reprogramming could be a potential strategy to prevent or mitigate aging-related pathologies like tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. Here, we explore the potential of this strategy in addressing tauopathy development in the P301S mouse model. To achieve this, a new transgenic animal was created that can inducibly overexpress Yamanaka factors upon doxycycline administration and carries the Tau-P301S mutation, which leads to tauopathy development. The results of this study show a significant improvement in key pathological features of tauopathies in the hippocampus, including reversed tauopathy, alleviated reactive astrogliosis, age-related reduction of the H3K9me3 epigenetic marker, along with improved spatial memory, which has been described as deteriorated in this model. These findings reinforce the potential of partial reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy to combat brain pathologies associated with aging.",Prog Neurobiol
40145267,Cut-points and gray zones: The challenges of integrating Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers into clinical practice.,"Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as plasma phosphorylated (p)-tau217, offer a more accessible means of testing for the presence of AD pathology compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) methods. They can support diagnostic assessment and determine patient eligibility for treatment with amyloid beta-lowering drugs in community settings where access to CSF examination and amyloid-PET are limited. However, there are important challenges associated with interpreting and integrating plasma biomarker results in clinical practice. This article explores different approaches to interpreting plasma biomarker results in secondary care, important potential sources of uncertainty, and considerations for their clinical application. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma biomarkers such as phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) offer a promising, accessible alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) for detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology, especially in settings with limited diagnostic resources. Clinical integration of plasma biomarker testing presents challenges, particularly in interpreting results. This includes uncertainties around intermediate results and their role in patient management. Clear frameworks and guidelines are essential to optimize the use of plasma biomarkers, supported by further research and education to ensure effective application in clinical practice.",Alzheimers Dement
39976261,Implementing a tridimensional diagnostic framework for personalized medicine in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose a significant challenge in modern medicine due to their clinical heterogeneity, multifactorial etiologies, and frequent co-pathologies. Traditional diagnostic systems, based on clinical symptoms and post mortem findings, are limited in capturing the complex interactions among genetic, molecular, and neuroanatomical factors. This manuscript introduces a novel tridimensional diagnostic framework that integrates these factors across three key axes: etiology (genetic and environmental influences), molecular markers (primary and secondary biomarkers), and neuroanatomoclinical correlations. Through case studies, we demonstrate the framework's ability to synthesize incomplete datasets, stratify patients, and guide precision medicine. By incorporating omics technologies, neuroimaging, and AI-driven probabilistic modeling, the framework enhances diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. This approach may contribute to overcoming the limitations of traditional nosologies, offering a scalable and adaptable tool for both clinical practice and research and advancing the field of precision medicine in NDD management. HIGHLIGHTS: Tridimensional diagnostic system: We propose a new framework that incorporates three axes - etiology, molecular markers, and neuroanatomical-clinical correlations - to enhance diagnostic accuracy for NDDs. Personalized medicine: The tridimensional system enables the integration of genetic, molecular, and clinical data, allowing for highly personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patients. Proteinopathies as key biomarkers: This diagnostic system emphasizes the use of primary proteinopathies (amyloid, tau, synuclein) and secondary biomarkers (eg, NfL, GFAP) to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Addressing clinical heterogeneity: The framework accommodates the complexity and heterogeneity of NDDs, offering an adaptable diagnostic approach for classical conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS. Case studies and real-world application: Practical case studies illustrate how this system can be implemented in clinical practice, enabling the combination of DMTs with symptomatic treatments.",Alzheimers Dement

Informal caregivers play a crucial role in providing essential support for individuals with ADRD. However, there is limited research that investigates the psychosocial functioning of caregivers (partners) from minoritized groups. Methods: This study aimed to explore the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) caregivers of individuals with ADRDs. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with seven caregivers of partners diagnosed with ADRDs. Three themes were identified based on reflexive thematic analysis: (i) experiencing familial alienation; (ii) fear about the future; and (iii) finding strength in the face of adversity.

40012832,MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT CLASSIFICATION USING A NOVEL FINER-SCALE BRAIN CONNECTOME.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. The neurodegeneration of brain connectivity networks plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of MCI. Traditionally, brain networks are generated using coarse-grained brain regions, where the regions serve as nodes and their functional or structural connections are used as edges. Recently, a novel finer scale brain folding patterns named 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) was identified, which is defined as the conjunctions coming from three directions on gyral crests. 3HGs have been shown playing an important role in brain network and can serve as hubs. In this study, our objective is to construct a novel 3HG-based finer-scale brain connectome and comprehensively compare its performance with traditional region-based connectome in predicting MCI against Normal Controls (NC). The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of 3HG-based brain connectome, shedding light on the potential of 3HG-based connectomes in capturing intricate neurodegenerative patterns associated with MCI and AD.",Proc IEEE Int Symp Biomed Imaging
40019771,Differential Effects of Aβ Peptides on the Plasmin-Dependent Degradation of ApoE3 and ApoE4.,"The ApoE4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) is the strongest hereditary predisposition to Alzheimer's disease, even though ApoE4 only differs from the more common ApoE3 by a single amino acid substitution. Previous studies have shown that ApoE4 is more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than ApoE3. This is an important finding because of ApoE's role in cholesterol homeostasis and lipid transport in the brain. The molecular determinants of the increased susceptibility of ApoE4 to proteolysis are unknown. Here, we apply a combination of spectrometric and spectroscopic methods to show that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, including Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(pyroE3-42), differentially modulate the plasmin-dependent degradation of ApoE3 and ApoE4. In particular, our data reveal that while the Aβ peptides do not affect the proteolysis of ApoE3, the peptides enhance the degradation of ApoE4 significantly. Overall, this work motivates therapeutic development that targets the Aβ-induced dysregulation of ApoE4 homeostasis in individuals carrying the ApoE4 allele.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40143446,Herpes simplex virus-1 infection alters microtubule-associated protein Tau splicing and promotes Tau pathology in neural models of Alzheimer's disease.,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection alters critical markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in neurons. One key marker of AD is the hyperphosphorylation of Tau, accompanied by altered levels of Tau isoforms. However, an imbalance in these Tau splice variants, specifically resulting from altered 3R to 4R MAPT splicing of exon 10, has yet to be directly associated with HSV-1 infection. To this end, we infected 2D and 3D human neural models with HSV-1 and monitored MAPT splicing and Tau phosphorylation. Further, we transduced SH-SY5Y neurons with HSV-1 ICP27, which alters RNA splicing, to analyze if ICP27 alone is sufficient to induce altered MAPT exon 10 splicing. We show that HSV-1 infection induces altered splicing of MAPT exon 10, increasing 4R-Tau protein levels, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and Tau oligomerization. Our experiments reveal a novel link between HSV-1 infection and the development of cytopathic phenotypes linked with AD progression.",Brain Pathol
40028824,Smooth Normative Brain Mapping of Three-Dimensional Morphometry Imaging Data Using Skew-Normal Regression.,"Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) aims at showing local differences in brain volumes with respect to a common template. TBM images are smooth, but they exhibit (especially in diseased groups) higher values in some brain regions called lateral ventricles. More specifically, our voxelwise analysis shows both a mean-variance relationship in these areas and evidence of spatially dependent skewness. We propose a model for three-dimensional imaging data where mean, variance and skewness functions vary smoothly across brain locations. We model the voxelwise distributions as skew-normal. We illustrate an interpolation-based approach to obtain smooth parameter functions based on a subset of voxels. The effects of age and sex are estimated on a reference population of cognitively normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set and mapped across the whole brain. The three parameter functions allow transforming each TBM image (in the reference population as well as in a test set) into a normative map based on Gaussian distributions. These subject-specific normative maps are used to derive indices of deviation from a healthy condition to assess the individual risk of pathological degeneration.",Hum Brain Mapp
40050853,Deep learning-based classification of dementia using image representation of subcortical signals.,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a neurological syndrome marked by cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia cases (AD and FTD) is crucial for effective medical care, as both conditions have similar early-symptoms. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing EEG derived scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique are utilized. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to validate the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (128 channels, comprising 16 AD, 13 FTD, and 19 healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (64 channels, including subjects with 10 AD, 9 MCI, and 8 HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes in both data sets.
RESULTS: The best results were achieved using a product of probabilities from classifiers for left and right subcortical regions in conjunction with the DenseNet model architecture. It yield accuracies of 94.17 % and 77.72 % on the BrainLat and IITD-AIIA datasets, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight that the image representation-based deep learning approach has the potential to differentiate various stages of dementia. It pave the way for more accurate and early diagnosis, which is crucial for the effective treatment and management of debilitating conditions.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak

This review highlights recent studies that utilized innovative, microglia-focused strategies for the treatment of diverse neurodegenerative disorders including lysosomal storage disorders, granulin frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Cutting-edge therapeutic strategies range from replacing faulty microglia with peripheral macrophage precursors or induced human pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia to engineering microglia that target toxic aggregates or deliver remediating payloads.

40086565,Amyloid β fragments that suppress oligomers but not fibrils are cytoprotective.,"Neurotoxic aggregates of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this work, we examined how seven overlapping fragments derived from Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> affect the oligomerization and toxicity of the full-length peptide. Four fragments inhibited the toxicity of oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> to various degrees, two others conferred no cellular protection against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> toxicity, and one fragment enhanced both Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomerization and toxicity. The structural and aggregation propensities of the peptides that support strong inhibition of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> toxicity have been identified. Data analysis allowed elucidation of the mechanisms of action of each of the seven peptide fragments on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> cytotoxicity. Our work establishes the potential therapeutic value of four Aβ fragments and supports the notion that agents directed to disruption of Aβ oligomers may be more effective AD drug candidates than those targeting Aβ fibrils.",Arch Biochem Biophys
40035705,Unnatural foldamers as inhibitors of Aβ aggregation via stabilizing the Aβ helix.,"Protein aggregation is a critical factor in the development and progression of several human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes. Among these conditions, AD is recognized as the most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. Neuronal toxicity is likely driven by soluble oligomeric intermediates of the Aβ peptide, which are thought to play a central role in the cascade leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. In response, numerous therapeutic strategies have been developed to inhibit Aβ oligomerization, as this is believed to delay the formation of Aβ protofibrils. Traditional research has focused on discovering small molecules or peptides that antagonize Aβ oligomerization. However, recent studies have explored an alternative approach-developing ligands that stabilize the Aβ peptide in its α-helical conformation. This stabilization is thought to alter the peptide's natural aggregation kinetics, shifting it away from toxic oligomer formation and toward less harmful states. Crucially, by maintaining Aβ in this α-helical form, these ligands have been shown to rescue the peptide's associated cytotoxicity, offering a promising mechanism to mitigate the detrimental effects of Aβ in AD. While challenges remain, including treatment costs and side effects like ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities), anti-Aβ drug development represents a major advancement in Alzheimer's research and therapeutic options. This brief review aims to highlight the development and potential of these α-helix-stabilizing ligands as antagonists of Aβ aggregation, focusing on their interactions with Aβ and how these compounds induce and maintain secondary structural changes in the Aβ peptide. Notably, this innovative strategy holds promise beyond Aβ-related pathology, as the fundamental principles could be applied to other amyloidogenic proteins implicated in various amyloid-related diseases, potentially broadening the scope of therapeutic intervention for multiple neurodegenerative conditions.",Chem Commun (Camb)
40164724,A cerebrospinal fluid synaptic protein biomarker for prediction of cognitive resilience versus decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous. Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20-40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case-control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in Aβ<sup>+</sup> and phosphorylated tau<sup>+</sup> (A+T<sub>1</sub>+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations. Regarding cognitive prognosis, CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 predicted conversion from A+T<sub>1</sub>+ cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 7.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and A+T<sub>1</sub>+ mild cognitive impairment to dementia (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 2.2, P = 8.2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>) over a 15-year follow-up, adjusting for CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>, CSF neurofilament, CSF neurogranin, CSF growth-associated protein 43, age, APOE4 and sex. We also developed a plasma proteomic signature of CI, which we evaluated in 13,401 samples, which partly recapitulated CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 as a robust prognostic biomarker for cognitive resilience versus AD onset and progression, highlight the potential of plasma proteomics in replacing CSF measurement and further implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.",Nat Med

40073745,Influence of Ibuprofen on glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in context of Alzheimer´s Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder associated with neuroinflammation, elevated oxidative stress, lipid alterations as well as amyloid-deposits and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Ibuprofen, a globally used analgesic, is discussed to influence disease progression due to its anti-inflammatory effect. However, changes in lipid-homeostasis induced by Ibuprofen have not yet been analyzed. Here we investigate the effect of Ibuprofen on lipid classes known to be associated with AD. Ibuprofen treatment leads to a significant increase in phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and triacylglyceride (TAG) species whereas plasmalogens, which are highly susceptible for oxidation, were significantly decreased. The observed alterations in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels in presence of Ibuprofen might counteract the reduced phosphatidylcholine- and sphingomyelin-levels found in AD brain tissue with potential positive aspects on synaptic plasticity and ceramide-induced apoptotic effects. On the other hand, Ibuprofen leads to elevated TAG-level resulting in the formation of lipid droplets which are associated with neuroinflammation. Reduction of plasmalogen-levels might accelerate decreased plasmalogen-levels found in AD brains. Treatment of Ibuprofen in terms of lipid-homeostasis reveals both potentially positive and negative changes relevant to AD. Therefore, understanding the influence of Ibuprofen on lipid-homeostasis may help to understand the heterogeneous results of studies treating AD with Ibuprofen.",Biomed Pharmacother
40084922,Regional Brain Metabolism across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum in Down Syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).
METHODS: We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.
RESULTS: In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.
INTERPRETATION: The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025.",Ann Neurol
40043855,Role of RhoA-ROCK signaling inhibitor fasudil in Alzheimer disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative brain disease linked with the development of dementia. AD neuropathology is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Different signaling pathways are involved in AD neuropathology through modulation of Aβ formation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. One of these signaling is Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). RhoA-ROCK signaling boosts the production of Aβ through activation of β-secretase and augments the formation of NFTs. RhoA-ROCK signaling is also intricate in the development of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Consequently, targeting RhoA-ROCK signaling by specific inhibitors, such as fasudil, may decrease AD neuropathology. Therefore, this perspective aims to discuss the role of RhoA-ROCK signaling in the pathogenesis of AD and how fasudil could be effective in its treatment.",Behav Brain Res
40164697,Metagenomic analysis characterizes stage-specific gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a decade-long preclinical pathological period that can be divided into several stages. Emerging evidence has revealed that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays an important role in AD pathology. However, the role of gut microbiota in different AD stages has not been well characterized. In this study, we performed fecal shotgun metagenomic analysis on a Chinese cohort with 476 participants across five stages of AD pathology to characterize stage-specific alterations in gut microbiota and evaluate their diagnostic potential. We discovered extensive gut dysbiosis that is associated with neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation, with over 10% of microbial species and gene families showing significant alterations during AD progression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that microbial gene families exhibited strong diagnostic capabilities, evidenced by an average AUC of 0.80 in cross-validation and 0.75 in independent external validation. In the optimal model, the most discriminant gene families are primarily involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, energy, glycan and vitamins. We found that stage-specific microbial gene families in AD pathology could be validated by an in vitro gut simulator and were associated with specific genera. We also observed that the gut microbiota could affect the progression of cognitive decline in 5xFAD mice through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could be used for early intervention of AD. Our multi-stage large cohort metagenomic analysis demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota occur from the very early stages of AD pathology, offering important etiological and diagnostic insights.",Mol Psychiatry
40114707,Therapeutic potential and microRNA regulating properties of phytochemicals in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by the aggregation of Aβ (peptide) and neurofibrillary tangles along with inflammatory processes. Aging is a significant driver of these alterations, and dementia is a major cause of disability and mortality. Despite extensive clinical trials over the past two decades, no effective drug has been developed to improve AD symptoms or slow its progression, indicating the inefficiency of current treatment targets. In AD development, the molecular microenvironment plays a significant role. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a key component of this microenvironment, regulate post-transcriptional gene expression, and are expressed more abundantly in the brain than in other tissues. Several dysregulated miRNAs in AD have been linked to neuropathological changes, such as plaque and tangle accrual, as well as altered expression of notorious molecules. Preclinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of phytochemicals/food bioactive compounds (PCs/FBCs) in regulating miRNA expression, which makes them immensely beneficial for targeting miRNA-altered expression patterns in neuronal diseases. This review highlights the potential of miRNAs in driving AD pathology and its development. Furthermore, it discusses the therapeutic efficacy of PCs/FBCs and their miRNA-regulatory properties, especially focusing on antiinflammatory and antioxidant capacities for their development as effective AD agents.",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids
40042514,Preclinical Alzheimer's disease shows alterations in circulating neuronal-derived extracellular vesicle microRNAs in a multiethnic cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, affecting around 50 million individuals worldwide. Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can cross the blood-brain barrier carrying neuron-specific molecules, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which have potential as biomarkers of neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We explored the association between neuronal-derived EV miRNAs from serum and AD clinical status by performing a transcriptome-wide association study involving 46 participants with clinical AD, 14 participants with preclinical AD, and 60 neurologically healthy controls.
RESULTS: We identified 14 miRNAs associated with AD risk, with more pronounced transcriptional alterations in preclinical individuals compared to clinical AD individuals. Functional analysis revealed enrichment of miRNA-target genes in neurodegenerative pathways, highlighting synuclein alpha (SNCA), cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS), and microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) as key targets.
DISCUSSION: Our results highlight the potential role of neuronal-derived EVs in neurodegeneration and suggest avenues for further research into brain-derived biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) carry potential brain biomarkers. We tested the association between NDEV microRNAs (miRNAs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fourteen NDEV miRNAs were associated with AD. Preclinical AD displayed more pronounced transcriptional changes than clinical AD. miRNA-target genes were enriched in pathways associated with neurodegeneration.",Alzheimers Dement
40145964,RBAD: the first database dedicated alterations of blood RNA in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their clinical relevance.,"Alzheimer's disease-associated transcriptomic landscapes have been defined in brain tissue. However, changes in blood RNA and their clinical relevance remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an RNA profile based on 1468 blood samples from both human and mouse studies, which include bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq data. We developed a comprehensive analysis pipeline that conducted over 11 million comparisons and correlations to identify more than 20,000 blood features. With these findings, we established a blood RNA database related to Alzheimer's disease, RNAs in Blood of AD (RBAD, http://www.bioinform.cn/RBAD/). Using RBAD, we initially validated well-established Alzheimer's disease-related pathways, including olfactory transduction. We then observed a decrease in both the proportion and functionality of erythroid cells, likely attributed to their elevated CD45 levels and interactions with GZMK+CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we identified 449 blood RNAs linked to patients' overall survival, along with two mRNAs (H4C3 and CTU1) associated with cognitive decline. In summary, RBAD is the first web-based analysis platform dedicated to investigating blood RNA changes in Alzheimer's disease, and provides valuable insights into potential peripheral biomarkers and pathogenic mechanisms related to Alzheimer's disease.",Neural Regen Res
40135505,MUTATE: a human genetic atlas of multiorgan artificial intelligence endophenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into imaging genetics to provide intermediate phenotypes (i.e. endophenotypes) that bridge the genetics and clinical manifestations of human disease. However, the genetic architecture of these AI endophenotypes remains largely unexplored in the context of human multiorgan system diseases. Using publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UK Biobank (UKBB), FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we comprehensively depicted the genetic architecture of 2024 multiorgan AI endophenotypes (MAEs). We comparatively assessed the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability, polygenicity, and natural selection signatures of 2024 MAEs using methods commonly used in the field. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses reveal both within-organ relationships and cross-organ interconnections. Bi-directional causal relationships were established between chronic human diseases and MAEs across multiple organ systems, including Alzheimer's disease for the brain, diabetes for the metabolic system, asthma for the pulmonary system, and hypertension for the cardiovascular system. Finally, we derived polygenic risk scores for the 2024 MAEs for individuals not used to calculate MAEs and returned these to the UKBB. Our findings underscore the promise of the MAEs as new instruments to ameliorate overall human health. All results are encapsulated into the MUlTiorgan AI endophenoTypE genetic atlas and are publicly available at https://labs-laboratory.com/mutate.",Brief Bioinform
40019008,The tau isoform 1N4R confers vulnerability of MAPT knockout human iPSC-derived neurons to amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau-induced neuronal dysfunction.,"INTRODUCTION: Human tau protein, composed of six brain-specific isoforms, is a major driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of its isoforms however remains unclear and human AD models are scarce.
METHODS: We generated human MAPT- (tau-) knockout (KO) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using CRISPR/Cas9, differentiated these into glutamatergic neurons, and assessed isoform-specific functions of tau in these neurons. We used omic- approaches, live-cell imaging, subcompartmental analysis, and lentivirus-based reintroduction of specific tau isoforms to investigate isoform-mediated neuronal dysfunction in an AD model.
RESULTS: Tau KO human iPSC-derived neurons showed decreased neurite outgrowth and axon initial segment length and, notably, resisted amyloid beta oligomer (AβO)-induced neuronal activity reduction. Introducing the 1N4R-tau isoform, but not other isoforms, confers AβO vulnerability and increases KxGS phosphorylation of tau, without altering neuronal activity or microtubule modifications.
DISCUSSION: While tau KO impacts neuronal development and activity, tau-KO also confers resistance against AβO insult. 1N4R-tau likely mediates AβO-induced and phosphorylated tau toxicity, representing a novel prime therapeutic target for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Tau knockout alters neurite growth and axon initial segment formation in human neurons. Tau isoforms show differential axonal localization in human neurons. Tau depletion protects against amyloid beta oligomer (AβO)-mediated neurotoxicity. 1N4R tau mediates AβO-induced toxicity in human neurons.",Alzheimers Dement
40016536,Single-Cell Analysis of Sex and Gender Differences in the Human Brain During Development and Disease.,"Sex and gender (SG) differences in the human brain are of interest to society and science as numerous processes are impacted by them, including brain development, behavior, and diseases. By collecting publicly available single-cell data from the in-utero to elderly age in healthy, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis samples, we identified and characterized SG-biased genes in ten brain cell types across 9 age and disease groups. Sex and gender differences in the transcriptome were present throughout the lifespan and across all cell types. Although there was limited overlap among SG-biased genes across different age and disease groups, we observed significant functional overlap. Female-biased genes are consistently enriched for brain-related processes, while male-biased genes are enriched for metabolic pathways. Additionally, mitochondrial genes showed a consistent female bias across cell types. We also found that androgen response elements (not estrogen) were significantly enriched in both male- and female-biased genes, and thymosin hormone targets being consistently enriched only in male-biased genes. We systematically characterised SG differences in brain development and brain-related disorders at a single-cell level, by analysing a total of publicly available 419,885 single nuclei from 161 human brain samples (72 females, 89 males). The significant enrichment of androgen (not estrogen) response elements in both male- and female-biased genes suggests that androgens are important regulators likely establishing these SG differences. Finally, we provide full characterization of SG-biased genes at different thresholds for the scientific community as a web resource.",Cell Mol Neurobiol
40034361,Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert in severe Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly prevalent, leading to severe cognitive decline and a diminished quality of life for patients. Nucleus basalis of Meynert deep brain stimulation (NBM-DBS) is a potential treatment approach.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of NBM-DBS for AD patients.
METHODS: We conducted a clinical study involving 6 patients with severe AD who received NBM-DBS. The treatment's safety and efficacy were evaluated using cognitive function tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale- cognitive subscale, Clinical Dementia Rating) and assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders (Functional Activity Questionnaire, Functional Independence Measure, Zarit Burden Interview, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index).
RESULTS: NBM-DBS was safe, with no severe adverse events. It improved cognitive functions and self-care abilities without altering the disease's progression. Notably, NBM-DBS significantly alleviated neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances.
CONCLUSIONS: NBM-DBS could be a promising therapeutic approach for severe AD, particularly for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep disorders. Further research is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40143552,Systematic Review of Differentially Abundant Proteins in People with Lewy Body Dementia.,"OBJECTIVES: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) are collectively called as Lewy body dementia (LBD). Despite the urgent clinical need, there is no reliable protein biomarker for LBD. Hence, we conducted the first comprehensive systematic review of all Differentially Abundant Proteins (DAP) in all tissues from people with LBD for advancing our understanding of LBD molecular pathology that is essential for facilitating discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LBD.
METHODS: We identified eligible studies by comprehensively searching five databases and grey literature (PROSPERO protocol:CRD42020218889). We completed quality assessment and extracted relevant data. We completed narrative synthesis and appropriate meta-analyses. We analysed functional implications of all reported DAP using DAVID tools.
RESULTS: We screened 11,006 articles and identified 193 eligible studies. 305 DAP were reported and 16 were replicated in DLB. 37 DAP were reported and three were replicated in PDD. Our meta-analyses confirmed six DAP (TAU, SYUA, NFL, CHI3L1, GFAP, CLAT) in DLB, and three DAP (TAU, SYUA, NFL) in PDD. There was no replicated blood-based DAP in DLB or PDD. The reported DAP may contribute to LBD pathology by impacting misfolded protein clearance, dopamine neurotransmission, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity and extracellular vesicles.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analyses confirmed significantly lower CSF TAU levels in DLB and CSF SYUA levels in PDD, when compared to Alzheimer's disease. Our findings indicate promising diagnostic biomarkers for LBD and may help prioritising molecular pathways for therapeutic target discovery. We highlight ten future research priorities based on our findings.",Acta Neuropsychiatr
40114255,Enriched knowledge representation in biological fields: a case study of literature-based discovery in Alzheimer's disease.,"BACKGROUND: In Literature-based Discovery (LBD), Swanson's original ABC model brought together isolated public knowledge statements and assembled them to infer putative hypotheses via logical connections. Modern LBD studies that scale up this approach through automation typically rely on a simple entity-based knowledge graph with co-occurrences and/or semantic triples as basic building blocks. However, our analysis of a knowledge graph constructed for a recent LBD system reveals limitations arising from such pairwise representations, which further negatively impact knowledge inference. Using LBD as the context and motivation in this work, we explore limitations of using pairwise relationships only as knowledge representation in knowledge graphs, and we identify impacts of these limitations on knowledge inference. We argue that enhanced knowledge representation is beneficial for biological knowledge representation in general, as well as for both the quality and the specificity of hypotheses proposed with LBD.
RESULTS: Based on a systematic analysis of one co-occurrence-based LBD system focusing on Alzheimer's Disease, we identify 7 types of limitations arising from the exclusive use of pairwise relationships in a standard knowledge graph-including the need to capture more than two entities interacting together in a single event-and 3 types of negative impacts on knowledge inferred with the graph-Experimentally infeasible hypotheses, Literature-inconsistent hypotheses, and Oversimplified hypotheses explanations. We also present an indicative distribution of different types of relationships. Pairwise relationships are an essential component in representation frameworks for knowledge discovery. However, only 20% of discoveries are perfectly represented with pairwise relationships alone. 73% require a combination of pairwise relationships and nested relationships. The remaining 7% are represented with pairwise relationships, nested relationships, and hypergraphs.
CONCLUSION: We argue that the standard entity pair-based knowledge graph, while essential for representing basic binary relations, results in important limitations for comprehensive biological knowledge representation and impacts downstream tasks such as proposing meaningful discoveries in LBD. These limitations can be mitigated by integrating more semantically complex knowledge representation strategies, including capturing collective interactions and allowing for nested entities. The use of more sophisticated knowledge representation will benefit biological fields with more expressive knowledge graphs. Downstream tasks, such as LBD, can benefit from richer representations as well, allowing for generation of implicit knowledge discoveries and explanations for disease diagnosis, treatment, and mechanism that are more biologically meaningful.",J Biomed Semantics
40110600,Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep deficiency is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We examined the association of sleep architecture with anatomical features observed in AD: (1) atrophy of hippocampus, entorhinal, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (""AD-vulnerable regions"") and (2) cerebral microbleeds.
METHODS: In 270 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study, we examined the association of baseline sleep architecture with anatomical features identified on brain MRI 13∼17 years later. Sleep architecture was quantified as the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS), proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and arousals index using polysomnography. Outcomes included (1) volumetric measurements of each AD-vulnerable region and (2) the presence of any cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and that of lobar CMBs, which are more specifically associated with AD. We analyzed the association of each sleep predictor with each MRI outcome, adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Median age was 61, 53% female, 100% were White, and 47% had 16+ years of education. Mmedian times in SWS and REM were 17.4% and 21.5%, respectively. Having less SWS was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-44.18 mm<sup>3</sup> per -1 percentage point [PP] of SWS, [95%CI=-76.62, -11.74]) and cuneus (β=-11.98 [=-20.92, -3.04] mm<sup>3</sup> per -1 PP of SWS). Having less REM was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-75.54 [-129.36, -21.72] mm<sup>3</sup> per 1 PP of REM) and precuneus (β=-31.92 [-63.78,-0.06] mm<sup>3</sup> per 1 PP of REM). After FDR adjustments, lower SWS and REM were associated with significantly smaller inferior parietal region volumes. Arousal index was not associated with the volumes of AD-vulnerable regions. None of the sleep architecture variables were associated with CMBs or lobar CMBs.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep deficiency is associated with the atrophy of the inferior parietal region, which is observed in early AD. Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for AD.",J Clin Sleep Med

With little available literature on empathy training for pharmacy students in caring for patients living with ADRD, this study outlined the implementation process of an immersive sensory experience, the Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT), into a Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum and evaluated the impact of the experience on pharmacy students' empathy for persons living with ADRD. After completing the VDT, quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the pharmacy students' ability to capably complete tasks and relax, and a positive change in their perceptions of the need for improved care for persons living with ADRD. Qualitative analytical approaches identified themes of ""Empathy,"" ""Patient Care and Advocacy,"" ""Education,"" as well as the cognitive, mental, and physical impact of the experience. Valuable lessons learned while providing ADRD empathy training to Doctor of Pharmacy students includes reallocation of faculty resources, curricular development of an innovative empathy-building experience for students, and improved experience delivery efficiency. Overall, a significant change in pharmacy students' empathy toward patients living with ADRD was observed.",Gerontol Geriatr Educ

Using the partial correlation analysis, the associations between TCD parameters and CBF values were explored among the defined subgroups.ResultsA higher VB pulsatility index (PI) was related to lower parietal CBF and lower VB end-diastolic velocity (EDV). Moreover, the significance of flow parameters in the basilar artery (BA) to parietal CBF was identified: peak-systolic velocity (PSV) unanimously showed positive correlations among all subgroups except SIVD, and both PSV and EDV showed positive correlations in AD. Of note, there were more noticeable ""BA flow-frontoparietal CBF"" associations among the high than low VB PI group, and AD than SIVD group.ConclusionsThe findings indicate that VB-resistance-related parietal vulnerability and topological CBF associations vary by dementia subtypes. Given VB hemodynamics-CBF relationships, the current research extends our understanding of the vasocognopathic effects among dementia patients.",J Alzheimers Dis
40051090,Safety and effectiveness of the anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug lecanemab for early Alzheimer's disease: The pharmacovigilance perspective.,"The development of humanized IgG1 anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, such as lecanemab, provides a promising novel treatment pathway with potential disease-modifying effects for patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lecanemab, which gained marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in July 2023, has since been approved in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom (UK). The decision by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve lecanemab in August 2024 followed similar regulatory decisions in the US and Japan. However, at the time of approval, the decision contrasted with that of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in July 2024. Subsequently, the EMA recommended the marketing approval of lecanemab in November 2024 following a re-examination of further data submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder. The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not recommended lecanemab for use in early AD amid concerns, including treatment cost and the translation of efficacy outcomes into clinically meaningful improvement. The risks of serious adverse events (SAEs), including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), have also emerged from clinical trial data with a concern for the potential for rare, life-threatening events. This narrative review discusses the requirement for a robust method of monitoring the safety and effectiveness of lecanemab in the real-world clinical setting considering recent regulatory decisions. Additionally, the need to evaluate proposed risk minimization measures (RMMs) is discussed considering the resource constraints of healthcare systems, such as those faced by the UK's National Health Service (NHS).",Br J Clin Pharmacol

40034528,Gut microbiota may affect Alzheimer's disease through synaptic function mediated by CAMs pathway: A study combining Mendelian randomization and bioinformatics.,"BACKGROUND: The association between gut microbes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been entirely elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to demonstrate the association between gut microbes and AD and to further investigate the pathogenesis of microbes with a causal relationship to AD.
METHODS: Mendelian randomization analyses were used to determine the significant causal relationship between gut microbes and AD. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was used to identify the hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis was used to reveal the pathogenesis theoretically between gut microbes and AD.
RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 32 microbes were identified that were significantly associated with AD. Subsequently, DLGAP2, NRXN3, NEGR1, NTNAP2, MYH9, and SCN3A were identified as hub genes. The genes NRXN3, NEGR1, and NTNAP2 were enriched in the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) signaling, and the taxons of gut microbes that corresponded to these were Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Actinomycetales, and Intestinimonas massiliensis.
CONCLUSIONS: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Actinomycetales, and Intestinimonas massiliensis may promote the progression of AD through the regulation of the CAMs signaling pathway-mediated synaptic function. Hence, the in-depth study of gut microbes may increase the efficiency of screening and diagnosis of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40050873,Cerium-doped Prussian blue biomimetic nanozyme as an amplified pyroptosis inhibitor mitigate Aβ oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.,"Antioxidant enzyme therapy shows promise for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), but significant challenges remain in achieving effective blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and sustained therapeutic effects. We developed a novel neutrophil membrane (NM)-coated cerium-doped Prussian blue biomimetic nanozyme (NM@PB-Ce) that demonstrates outstanding enzymatic properties and targeted therapeutic efficacy. Extensive physicochemical characterization using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering confirmed the successful synthesis of uniform nanoparticles (~ 142 nm) with preserved membrane protein functionality. In vitro studies utilizing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells revealed that NM@PB-Ce effectively scavenged reactive oxygen species through multiple enzyme-mimetic activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase). The nanozyme significantly suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis, reducing inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-18) while attenuating Aβ aggregation. Using a sophisticated co-culture BBB model and real-time in vivo fluorescence imaging, we demonstrated NM@PB-Ce's ability to traverse the BBB and accumulate specifically in AD-affected regions. In an Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced AD mouse model, systematic administration of NM@PB-Ce (320 μg/mL, 0.01 mL/g/day for 14 days) significantly improved cognitive performance across multiple behavioral paradigms, including the Morris water maze, Y-maze, and open field tests. Molecular and histological analyses revealed decreased neuroinflammation markers (GFAP, Iba-1) in the hippocampus, reduced levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and phosphorylated tau (demonstrated by Western blot and ELISA), and enhanced dendritic spine density (visualized through Golgi staining). This comprehensive study establishes NM@PB-Ce as a promising therapeutic platform for AD treatment, providing both mechanistic insights into its mode of action and robust evidence of its therapeutic efficacy in targeting neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.",J Nanobiotechnology

However, blood p-tau 181 is also elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without a clearly identified source. We measured serum p-tau 181 and p-tau 217 in a multicentre cohort of ALS (n = 152), AD (n = 111) cases and disease controls (n = 99) recruited from four different centres. Further, we investigated the existence of both p-tau species using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mass spectrometry (MS) in muscle biopsies of ALS cases (IHC: n = 13, MS: n = 5) and disease controls (IHC: n = 14, MS: n = 5) from one cohort. Serum p-tau 181 and p-tau 217 were higher in AD and ALS patients compared to disease controls. IHC and MS analyses revealed the presence of p-tau 181 and 217 in muscle biopsies from both ALS cases and disease controls, with ALS samples showing increased p-tau reactivity in atrophic muscle fibres. Blood p-tau species could potentially be used to diagnose both ALS and AD.",Nat Commun
39997004,Development of Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis and Monitoring from Traditional to Digital Biomarkers.,"Monitoring and assessing the progression of symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are critical for improving patient outcomes. Traditional biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis and brain imaging, are widely used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of disease and enable early diagnosis. In contrast, digital biomarkers derived from phenotypic changes-such as EEG, eye movement, gait, and speech analysis-offer a noninvasive and accessible alternative. Leveraging portable and widely available devices, such as smartphones and wearable sensors, digital biomarkers are emerging as a promising tool for ND diagnosis and monitoring. This review highlights the comprehensive developments in digital biomarkers, emphasizing their unique advantages and integration potential alongside traditional biomarkers.",Biosensors (Basel)

39986315,The impacts of air pollution on mortality and hospital readmission among Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias: a national retrospective cohort study in the USA.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, posing a critical worldwide public health challenge. Ambient air pollution has been identified as a potential risk factor for AD progression based on toxicological and epidemiological studies. We aimed to evaluate the impacts of air pollution-including fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2·5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), summer ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and oxidant-on readmission or death among Medicare enrollees previously hospitalised with an AD/ADRD diagnosis code.
METHODS: We constructed a population-based nationwide retrospective cohort including all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (aged ≥65 years) in the contiguous USA (2000-16) hospitalised with AD/ADRD, and followed them up from the year after their first hospitalisation until (1) year of death (mortality cohort) and (2) year of second hospitalisation for any cause (readmission cohort). We calculated annual average PM<sub>2·5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, summer O<sub>3</sub>, and oxidant concentrations for each individual at their residential ZIP code in each year after their first hospitalisation with AD/ADRD. We applied Cox proportional hazard models for the mortality and readmission cohorts stratifying on individual risk factors and adjusting for socioeconomic status, seasonal temperatures, and relative humidity.
FINDINGS: Our cohort consisted of 5 544 118 individuals, of whom 4 543 759 (82·0%) died and 3 880 894 (70·0%) were readmitted to the hospital during the study period. The average follow-up times were 3·34 years (SD 2·60) for the mortality cohort and 1·98 years (SD 1·65) for the readmission cohort. In both the mortality and readmission cohorts we found significant associations with each pollutant. For an IQR increase in NO<sub>2</sub>, we found a hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 1·012 (95% CI 1·009-1·015) and an HR for readmission of 1·110 (1·104-1·117). In the readmission cohort, we found an HR of 1·084 (1·079-1·089) for an IQR increase (3·87 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) in PM<sub>2·5</sub>. The results slightly decreased in multi-pollutant models. The results of effect modification for mortality and readmission varied by pollutant, but higher risks were found among Black males and among those eligible for Medicaid in general.
INTERPRETATION: We provide new evidence that among a susceptible population with previous AD/ADRD-related hospitalisations, annual air pollution exposure since first hospitalisation is associated with risk of readmission and death.

40097093,Understanding the semantic organization of animal fluency in mild Alzheimer's disease through time-course analysis and LDA topic modelling.,"Deterioration of semantic memory represents an important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been widely addressed in neuropsychological research. A way to understand semantic integrity in AD patients is through a detailed analysis of verbal fluency (VF) performance. In the present study, we used an innovative methodology that combines measures of between-words latencies together with automatized identification of semantic clusters via Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to acquire a more precise understanding of the dynamics and semantic organization of VF in patients at early stages of AD. Importantly, and diverging from customary procedures, we included VF errors (i.e., repetitions and intrusions) across analyses. For comparison, a group of healthy older adults and young individuals were also examined. Standard parameters including total correct answers, number of clusters, mean cluster size (MCS), cluster duration, and within and out-of-cluster intervals were calculated. These parameters were expressed as mean values in 1-min VF trials and by calculating mean values in four 15-s time windows. Results for the 1-min trial demonstrated significantly larger mean cluster sizes (MCS) and fewer generated answers in AD patients compared to the healthy groups. No additional group differences were found neither on time intervals (both within and out-of-clusters), nor on the 15-s time windows analyses. These data suggest that the clustering ability of mild AD patients might be affected by executive impairments promoting larger MCS. At the same time, we found similar semantic processes and timings in patients and healthy participants. The main difference resides in the structure of the patients' clusters, which encompassed erroneous answers. We advance the idea that production of errors might not only be a consequence of executive dysfunction or working memory deterioration, but also a sign that associative semantic mechanisms are still active early in the disease, despite an evident loss of information.",Neuropsychologia
40042515,Parkinsonism in Alzheimer's disease without Lewy bodies in association with nigral neuron loss: A data-driven clinicopathologic study.,"INTRODUCTION: Parkinsonism in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often attributed to Lewy-related pathology, given its high comorbidity. In the era of anti-amyloid therapy, recognizing parkinsonism caused by AD pathology is needed to optimize the treatment.
METHODS: This study aimed to quantitatively characterize parkinsonism and nigral neuropathology in AD without Lewy bodies (LB). Nigral neurons were counted automatically. Fine-tuned ChatGPT collected structured clinical data.
RESULTS: Among 635 AD patients without LB, 62 (9.7%) presented parkinsonism, which correlated with reduced nigral neuron density (p < 0.01). Tau burden did not explain the nigral neuronal loss. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology correlated with reduced nigral pigmented neuron density (p = 0.03).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that parkinsonism in AD without LB is related to nigral neuronal loss in association with TDP-43 pathology. Recognition of parkinsonism in AD without LB is crucial for appropriate therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: One in 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients without Lewy bodies had parkinsonism. Parkinsonism in AD was correlated with reduced nigral neuron density. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathology was associated with nigral degeneration in AD. AD should be included in the differential diagnosis of dementia with parkinsonism.",Alzheimers Dement
40064805,Insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease: signalling mechanisms and therapeutics strategies.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, is characterised by hallmark abnormalities such as amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Emerging evidence suggests that faulty insulin signalling contributes to these pathological features, impairing critical cellular and metabolic processes.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to elucidate the role of insulin signalling in the central nervous system (CNS) under normal and pathological conditions and to explore therapeutic approaches targeting insulin pathways in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: We reviewed studies highlighting the involvement of insulin-signalling pathways in neuronal health, with a particular focus on the key components-IRS, PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β-predominantly expressed in cortical and hippocampal regions.
RESULTS: Insulin, an essential growth factor, regulates numerous cellular functions, including glucose metabolism, mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress response, autophagy, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive processes. Altered phosphorylation of signalling molecules in insulin pathways contributes to oxidative stress, inflammation, and the formation of AD hallmarks. Indirect modulators such as NF-κB and caspases further exacerbate neuronal damage, linking impaired insulin signalling to neurodegeneration.
CONCLUSION: Insulin signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal health and mitigating neurodegenerative processes. Targeting insulin pathways and associated molecules offers promising therapeutic avenues for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",Inflammopharmacology
40110647,Exploratory analysis of the proteomic profile in plasma in adults with Down syndrome in the context of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) show increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the triplication of chromosome 21 encoding the amyloid precursor protein gene. Further, this triplication possibly contributes to dysregulation of the immune system, furthering AD pathophysiology.
METHODS: Using Olink Explore 3072, we measured ∼3000 proteins in plasma from 73 adults with DS and 15 euploid, healthy controls (HC). Analyses for differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were carried out, and pathway and protein network enrichment using Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and STRING database was investigated. Within DS, the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) feature selection was applied.
RESULTS: We identified 253 DEP between DS and HC and 142 DEP between symptomatic and asymptomatic DS. Several pathways regarding inflammatory and neurodevelopmental processes were dysregulated in both analyses. LASSO feature selection within DS returned 15 proteins as potential blood markers.
DISCUSSION: This exploratory proteomic analysis found potential new blood biomarkers for diagnosing DS-AD in need of further investigation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Inflammatory pathways are dysregulated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic DS. NFL and GFAP are confirmed as powerful biomarkers in DS with clinical and/or cognitive decline. Further circulating proteins were identified as potential blood biomarkers for symptomatic DS.",Alzheimers Dement
40145384,Amyloid PET predicts longitudinal functional and cognitive trajectories in a heterogeneous cohort.,"INTRODUCTION: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly available for diagnosis of Alzheimer`s disease (AD); however, its practical implications in heterogenous cohorts are debated.
METHODS: Amyloid PET from 890 National Alzheimer`s Coordinating Center participants with up to 10 years post-PET follow up was analyzed. Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed models were used to investigate amyloid burden prediction of etiology and prospective functional status and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Amyloid positivity was associated with progression from unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Amyloid burden in the unimpaired group was associated with lower initial memory levels and faster decline in memory, language, and global cognition. In the Impaired group, amyloid was associated with lower initial levels and faster decline for memory, language, executive function, and global cognition.
DISCUSSION: Amyloid burden is an important prognostic marker in a clinically heterogeneous cohort. Future work is needed to establish the proportion of decline driven by AD versus non-AD processes in the context of mixed pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our findings highlight the importance of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in heterogenous cohorts, including diverse demographics, clinical syndromes, and underlying etiologies. The results also provide evidence that higher amyloid levels were linked to functional progression from unimpaired cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, higher amyloid burden was associated with poorer memory at baseline and subsequent declines in memory, language, and global cognition. Among individuals with cognitive impairment, amyloid burden was associated with worse initial memory, language, executive function, and global cognition, and faster declines over time.",Alzheimers Dement
40110612,Multi-modality NDE fusion using encoder-decoder networks for identify multiple neurological disorders from EEG signals.,"BackgroundThe complexity and diversity of brain activity patterns make it difficult to accurately diagnose neurological disorders such epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Integrated and effective analysis of multiple data sources is often beyond the scope of traditional diagnostic procedures. With the use of multi-modal data, recent developments in neural network approaches present encouraging opportunities for raising diagnostic accuracy.ObjectivesA novel approach has been proposed toward the integration of different Nondestructive Evaluation data with EEG signals for improving the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, by leveraging advanced neural network techniques in order to improve the identification and correlation of shared latent features across heterogeneous NDE datasets.MethodsWe determined the 2D scalogram images using a specific encoder-decoder neural network after transforming the EEG signals using wavelet signal processing. Several NDE data types can be easily integrated for thorough analysis due to this network's ability to extract and correlate important aspects from each form of data. Aiming to uncover common patterns indicating of neurological disorders, the technique was evaluated on datasets containing EEG signals and corresponding NDE data.ResultsOur method demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The encoder-decoder network effectively identified shared latent features across the heterogeneous NDE datasets, leading to more precise and reliable diagnoses. The fusion of multi-modality NDE data with EEG signals provided a robust framework for the automatic identification of multiple neurological disorders.ConclusionsThis innovative approach represents a substantial advancement in the field of neurological disorder diagnosis. By integrating diverse NDE data with EEG signals through advanced neural network techniques, we have developed a method that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing multiple neurological conditions. This fusion of multi-modality data has the potential to revolutionize current diagnostic practices in neurology, paving the way for more precise and automated identification of neurological disorders.",Technol Health Care
40148430,Construction and evaluation of a diagnostic model for Alzheimer's disease based on mitophagy-related genes.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Mitophagy fulfills crucial functions in neurodegenerative disorders and neuronal survival but the relationship between mitophagy and AD is unclear. Mitophagy correlation scores between AD samples and control samples were calculated using single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) based on two datasets from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Mitophagy-related genes (MRGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD screened by WGCNA and ""limma"" package were intersected to take common genes. These overlapping genes were further compressed and used for diagnostic modeling by adopting the recursive feature elimination (RFE) and LASSO analysis. The reliability of the diagnostic model was verified based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Then, a transcription factor (TF)-mRNA regulatory network of these key genes was established. Lastly, ssGSEA was employed to examine the relationship between the identified genes and cellular pathways and immune cell infiltration. AD samples had notably lower mitophagy correlation scores than control samples. A total of 12 MRGs in the module with the greatest mitophagy connection with AD patients were identified. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in synaptic function-related pathways. Based on GSE122063, a diagnostic prediction model was created and validated using two mitophagy-related genes (YWHAZ and NDE1), showing an area under ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.7. This confirmed that the diagnostic model had a high predictive value. The TF-mRNA network showed that four TFs, namely, FOXC1, FOXL1, HOXA5 and GATA2, were regulated by both YWHAZ and NDE1 genes. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that NDE1 promoted the infiltration of most immune cells, while YWHAZ mainly inhibited the infiltration of most immune cells. The current findings improved our understanding of mitophagy in AD, contributing to future research and treatment development in AD.",Sci Rep
39994996,Regulation of glial ApoE secretion by the mevalonate pathway is independent of ApoE isoform.,"BackgroundLipids synthesized in astrocytes are distributed to other brain cells in high-density lipoprotein-like ApoE particles. ApoE, which is a powerful genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease, is secreted differently depending on genotype. Secretion of ApoE from mouse astrocytes is regulated by the mevalonate pathway.ObjectiveWe aimed to understand if the regulation of ApoE secretion from astrocytes by the mevalonate pathway was the same between mouse ApoE and ApoE from humanized mice, and if this is impacted by ApoE isoform.MethodsAstrocyte-enriched glial cultures from wild-type and humanized ApoE targeted-replacement mice were treated with pharmacological inhibitors of various steps along the mevalonate pathway and ApoE in the conditioned media was measured.ResultsWe show that statins and prenylation inhibitors, but not specific cholesterol inhibitors, reduce extracellular ApoE lipoparticle levels in astrocyte-enriched glial cultures, and that this occurs in cells harboring either the mouse ApoE or any of the three human ApoE genotypes to a similar extent. We find that geranylgeranylation modulates ApoE release from astrocytes, and it does so independent of ApoE genotype.ConclusionsOur results suggest that prenylation broadly regulates ApoE secretion from astrocytes regardless of ApoE genotype, and that this is mediated specifically by geranylgeranylation. Therefore, our data implicates geranylgeranylation as a general mechanism modulating ApoE release from astrocytes, but likely is not responsible for the reported baseline differences in ApoE secretion seen in vivo and in vitro across genotypes.",J Alzheimers Dis

40110699,Association of neighborhood disadvantage with cognitive function and cortical disorganization in an unimpaired cohort: An exploratory study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood disadvantage has been shown to impact health and cognitive outcomes, while morphological similarity network (MSN) can elucidate structural morphological patterns underlying cognitive functions. We hypothesized MSNs could provide cortical patterns linked with neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive function, explaining the potential risk of cognitive impairment in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
METHODS: For cognitively unimpaired participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (n = 524), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (n = 100), neighborhood disadvantage was obtained using Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and its association with cognitive performance and MSN features was analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis.
RESULTS: Neighborhood disadvantage was associated with worse cognitive performance on memory, executive function, processing speed, and preclinical Alzheimer's tests on both datasets. Local morphological organization of predominantly the frontal and temporal regions showed association trends with ADI.
DISCUSSION: Morphological patterns associated with ADI, in-part, may explain the risk for poor cognitive functioning in a neighborhood disadvantaged population.
HIGHLIGHTS: Social determinants of health such as neighborhood context can be studied using ADI. High neighborhood disadvantage was related to worse performance on category fluency, implicit learning speed, story recall memory and pre-clinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite. In this exploratory study, using morphological brain networks that indicate similarity in distribution of cortical thickness between regions, we observed that centrality of predominantly frontal and temporal regions was marginally linked with neighborhood disadvantage status and also partially mediated its association with preclinical Alzheimer's composite test. There is a potential role for considering neighborhood status in early screening of cognitive impairment and dementia.",Alzheimers Dement
40021611,Diabetes and Hypertension at Midlife Predict Increases in Biomarkers of Dementia Among Black Americans.,"BACKGROUND: Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, Black Americans show accelerated brain aging beginning in midlife and exhibit higher rates and earlier onset of dementia. While these patterns are often viewed as evidence that Black Americans are more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease, another possibility is that their high risk for chronic vascular pathologies such as high blood pressure and diabetes compromises their brain health. This hypothesis was tested in the present study.
METHODS: Participants included 252 middle-aged Black Americans enrolled in the Family and Community Health Study and living in Iowa or Georgia who had ascertainment of diabetes and hypertension in 2008 and blood drawn in 2008 and 2019. Linear regression models assessed whether hypertension and diabetes were associated with change in neurofilament light chain (NfL), a non-specific biomarker of brain pathology including vascular dementia, and phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau181), a biomarker of underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.
RESULTS: Having a diagnosis of either hypertension or diabetes during middle age was not associated with levels of either p-Tau181 or NfL. However, having a diagnosis of both hypertension and diabetes was robustly associated with higher levels of NfL and increases in NfL over an 11-year period.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Black Americans, comorbid hypertension and diabetes contribute to higher levels of serum NfL, our indicator of neurodegeneration, during late middle age but not with p-Tau181, our indicator of Alzheimer's disease. Rather than being instances of AD, elevated rates of dementia among Black Americans may be largely vascular pathology caused by high rates of diabetes and high blood pressure.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities
40022853,Beyond the eye: A relational model for early dementia detection using retinal OCTA images.,"Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module to explore the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns. The proposed model is trained, tested, and validated on four retinal OCTA datasets, including 1,671 participants with AD, MCI, and healthy controls. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our model in detecting AD and MCI with an AUC of 88.69% and 88.02%, respectively. Our results provide evidence that retinal OCTA imaging, coupled with artificial intelligence, may serve as a rapid and non-invasive approach for large-scale screening of AD and MCI.

40106969,Discovery of new dual butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonists as compounds used to treat Alzheimer's disease symptoms.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition with no effective cure, and current therapies, like donepezil, only alleviate symptoms. Research has explored cholinesterase inhibitors and strategies targeting tau protein, often combining inhibitors with 5-HT receptor antagonists, particularly 5-HT<sub>6</sub>. However, dual-action BuChE inhibitors and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> antagonists have not been studied until now. This study evaluated such compounds in an animal model, focusing on two candidates: compound 18 (BuChE IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.75 μM; 5-HT<sub>7</sub>K<sub>i</sub> = 7 nM) and compound 50 (BuChE IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.53 μM; 5-HT<sub>7</sub>K<sub>i</sub> = 1 nM). Compound 50 showed robust cognitive improvements, enhancing memory consolidation and acquisition, particularly in reversing scopolamine-induced deficits. In contrast, compound 18 exhibited limited or dose-dependent efficacy, potentially limiting its applicability. These findings highlight the strong potential of compound 50 for cognitive enhancement therapies and suggest it warrants further investigation.",Biomed Pharmacother
40052227,Therapeutic Treatment With OLX-07010 Inhibited Tau Aggregation and Ameliorated Motor Deficits in an Aged Mouse Model of Tauopathy.,"Targeting tau protein is a strategy for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and numerous rare tauopathies. A small molecule approach targeting tau aggregation was used to select and optimize compounds inhibiting tau self-association in vitro that have translated in vivo in preventive studies in htau and P301L tau JNPL3 mouse models of tauopathy. In this therapeutic treatment study, aged JNPL3 mice with pre-existing tau aggregates were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of OLX-07010. The study had a Baseline group of mice aged 7 months, a vehicle, and two dose groups treated until 12 months by administration in feed. The primary endpoint of the study was the reduction of insoluble tau aggregates with statistical significance. The secondary endpoints were dose-dependent reduction of insoluble tau aggregates, reduction of soluble tau, and improvement of motor behavior. ELISAs and immunoblots were used to determine the levels of tau and its aggregated forms including self-associated tau and Sarkosyl insoluble tau. Effect on motor behavior, as measured by Rotarod assay, was also assessed between the treatment groups. At the end of treatment, reduced levels of self-associated tau, Sarkosyl insoluble tau aggregates, and overall levels of tau in the heat-stable fraction with statistical significance in the cortex were observed. Treatment prevented the accumulation of tau aggregates above baseline, and in parallel, treatment groups had improved motor behavior in a Rotarod assay compared to baseline and vehicle control groups, suggesting that treatment was rescuing motor impairment in aged mice. The functional and biochemical readouts suggest that this small molecule has potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases characterized by tau aggregation such as AD and progressive supranuclear palsy.",J Neurochem
39999928,Towards a better diagnosis and treatment of dementia: Identifying common and distinct neuropathological mechanisms in Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) together contribute to almost 90 % of all dementia cases leading to major health challenges of our time with a substantial global socioeconomic burden. While in AD, the improved understanding of Amyloid beta (Aß) mismetabolism and tau hyperphosphorylation as pathophysiological hallmarks has led to significant clinical breakthroughs, similar advances in VaD are lacking. After comparing the clinical presentation, including risk factors, disease patterns, course of diseases and further diagnostic parameters for both forms of dementia, we highlight the importance of shared pathomechanisms found in AD and VaD: Endothelial damage, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and hypoperfusion inducing oxidative stress and inflammation and thus trophic uncoupling in the neurovascular unit. A dysfunctional endothelium and BBB lead to the accumulation of neurotoxic molecules and Aß through impaired clearance, which in turn leads to neurodegeneration. In this context we discuss possible neuropathological parameters, which might serve as biomarkers and thus improve diagnostic accuracy or reveal targets for novel therapeutic strategies for both forms of dementia.",Neurobiol Dis
40151396,Biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases in regulatory decision-making by the European Medicines Agency.,"INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers (BMs) are valuable tools to facilitate early diagnosis of (subtypes of) diseases, improve patient selection and stratification, and detect therapeutic effects or safety concerns. This study explores the extent to which BMs are utilized in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), as well as topics of discussion regarding BMs in regulatory advice- and decision-making processes and sharing of BM-related data.
METHODS: The European Medicines Agency's marketing authorization application (MAA), qualification (QA/QO), and scientific advice (SA) procedures regarding NDDs were screened, and those that mention BMs were analyzed. Data were extracted on the intended disease, BM type, and context of use proposed by applicants. BMs were categorized based on both nature and function.
RESULTS: In total, 105 procedures that discussed BMs were analyzed, 57 SAs (January 2020 to December 2022), 19 QAs/QOs (January 2008 to December 2023), and 29 MAAs (January 1995 to December 2023). The majority involved Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 30), Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 9), and multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 33). Imaging BMs were the most common type of BMs discussed, and most BMs were used as pharmacodynamic/response measures. The acceptance and role of BMs differed between AD, PD, MS, and other NDDs. In regulatory procedures for AD, for example, diagnostic BMs guiding patient selection were commonly discussed, whereas in MAAs for MS, imaging BMs (particularly lesions) were generally accepted as supportive/secondary endpoints.
DISCUSSION: Despite the established role of certain BMs, mainly imaging BMs for MS, there remains a major need for more precise and reliable BMs to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment monitoring for NDDs. To implement novel BMs and facilitate development of new treatments and to eventually improve clinical practice, robust evidence bases showcasing biological plausibility or clear clinical benefits are essential. Collaboration and data-sharing among stakeholders is vital in generating this evidence and enhancing the understanding and management of NDDs.
HIGHLIGHTS: The European Medicines Agency's marketing authorization applications and qualification and scientific advice procedures.One hundred five procedures were analyzed regarding neurodegenerative diseases that discuss biomarkers.We found that acceptance and role of biomarkers differ per disease.Biological plausibility/clinical benefits are essential for biomarker implementation.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)

Understanding the pathophysiological cascade related to Aβ and tau process is crucial.ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau on tau pathology and cognitive decline in AD.MethodsWe analyzed 319 older individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who underwent Aβ (<sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir or <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET scans, along with CSF and cognitive assessments. Aβ positivity (A+) was determined by global standardized uptake value ratio thresholds of ≥1.11 for <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir or ≥1.08 for <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben, while p-tau positivity (T+) was defined as CSF p-tau181 levels ≥23 pg/ml. Linear mixed regression models were used to assess the effects of PET Aβ and CSF p-tau181 levels on tau accumulation in predefined Braak regions and cognitive function over time.ResultsOur results revealed significant differences in PET tau pathology and cognitive decline between A + and A- individuals. We observed that interactions between Aβ and p-tau proteins were associated with tau accumulation and cognitive decline. Additionally, A-/T + individuals exhibited higher levels of tau accumulation in all Braak regions compared to A-/T- counterparts, suggesting a potential independent role of p-tau in tau pathology in the absence of Aβ.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that Aβ positivity and elevated CSF p-tau181 levels were associated with tau accumulation and cognitive decline, highlighting the relevance of soluble p-tau as a potential biomarker for further investigation.",J Alzheimers Dis
40024726,[Modulation of Cognitive and Psychiatric Functions by Psychostimulant-responsive Molecules].,"Methamphetamine, a psychostimulant drug, acts on dopaminergic neuron terminals projecting from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, which constitutes the reward system in the brain. In addition to dependence triggered by excessive excitation of the reward system, methamphetamine induces various effects, including hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive dysfunction. This means that molecules responsive to methamphetamine are importantly involved in the brain function. This report reviews the functions of Shati/Nat8l and Piccolo, identified as methamphetamine-responsive molecules in the murine nucleus accumbens, in cognitive and psychiatric functions clarified by rodent studies. Shati/Nat8l is related to drug addiction and depression and participates in the synaptic function of the hippocampus to maintain cognitive function. Its upregulation suppresses cognitive disturbance in Alzheimer's disease pathology. In the nucleus accumbens, Piccolo contributes to the behavioral alteration caused by methamphetamine. Piccolo downregulation in the prefrontal cortex induced schizophrenia-like behavioral and neuronal changes in mice. These findings indicate that Shati/Nat8l and Piccolo exert important functions on the brain and are potential targets for brain disorder studies. It is anticipated that understanding of brain function will be achieved through the analysis of methamphetamine-responsive molecules.",Yakugaku Zasshi
40096973,The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease among diabetic patients in Saudi Arabia.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among 228 Saudi adults with diabetes, aiming to assess cognitive awareness through a questionnaire. It explores risk factors, symptoms, prevention strategies, and attitudes towards dementia, while integrating demographic data to illuminate cognitive landscapes and correlations between diabetes and cognitive health.
METHODS: Trained dietitians administered questionnaires to 228 adult Saudi diabetic participants, focusing on their understanding of AD across various domains. The study employed validated tools for data collection and amalgamated responses with demographic and medical details.
RESULTS: Of the 228 participants, 56.6% were female. Findings revealed a high acknowledgment of 3 subdomains of the Alzheimer's disease knowledge scale (ADKS) - risk factors, course, and diagnosis - with 75% agreement. However, lower acknowledgment rates with agreements were observed in the domains of life impact (71%), symptoms (71%), caregiving (72%), and treatment management (69%). Statistical analysis indicated significant differences in knowledge based on education levels (p≤0.05), with university-educated individuals demonstrating greater agreement across all ADKS subdomains.
CONCLUSION: The research highlights the need for enhanced awareness of AD among Saudi diabetic individuals. By integrating healthcare, education, and culturally sensitive interventions, the study advocates for targeted education to improve understanding of cognitive health and effective management strategies in this demographic, emphasizing the role of educational background in shaping perceptions.",Saudi Med J
40156243,Unraveling temporal patterns of diagnostic markers and comorbidities in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from large-scale data.,"INTRODUCTION: Comorbid conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood regarding timing and potential impact on disease onset and progression.
METHODS: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV electronic health records from 2008 to 2019 were examined. The study identified 2527 AD patients (34.9% male, mean age 80.27 years) among 299,712 patients. We examined the timing of 12 cardiovascular and metabolic diseases relative to AD diagnosis. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center validated the findings.
RESULTS: Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, diagnosed 1.09 years before AD. Depression was the only comorbidity diagnosed after AD start, 0.16 years on average. AD patients had greater rates of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and depression compared to the general population.
DISCUSSION: The findings emphasize early detection and therapy of AD-related comorbidities, notably cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The temporal link between these diseases and AD suggests opportunities for preventive strategies and improved care pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Temporal analysis of comorbidities: The study reveals hypertension and hyperlipidemia as leading precursors to AD, typically diagnosed 1 to 1.3 years prior to AD onset, while depression emerges predominantly after diagnosis. Unique data integration: Large-scale datasets from MIMIC-IV (n = 299,712) and NACC (n = 51,836) were leveraged to identify chronological patterns in 12 key comorbid conditions relative to AD diagnosis. Sex- and age-specific insights: AD prevalence peaks at 80 to 86 years, with females exhibiting higher rates of LOAD compared to males. Depression as a post-diagnostic marker: Unlike other comorbidities, depression's post-diagnostic mean onset (0.16 years after AD diagnosis) highlights the need for targeted mental health interventions in AD patients. Implications for early detection: Findings suggest that managing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other modifiable conditions in midlife may delay or reduce the risk of AD development. Comorbidity variability across cohorts: Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia showed significantly higher prevalence in the NACC cohort compared to MIMIC-IV, reflecting potential dataset-specific biases or regional healthcare differences. Future research directions: Advocates for longitudinal, multiethnic, and global studies to refine early diagnostic criteria and explore preventive strategies tailored to comorbid conditions.",Alzheimers Dement
39989007,Tau-related reduction of glucose metabolism in mild cognitive impairment occurs independently of APOE ε4 genotype and is influenced by Aβ.,"INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have shown that amyloid beta (Aβ) is significantly correlated with glucose metabolism in mild cognitive impairment independently of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype.
METHODS: We used a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach to pairwise cross-correlation among tau, Aβ, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET images. The resulting SVD-based tau and Aβ scores as well as the APOE ε4 genotype, were entered as predictors in a voxelwise general linear model for statistical assessment of their effect on FDG.
RESULTS: We found cortical regions where a reduced glucose metabolism was maximally correlated with distributed patterns of tau, accounting for the effect of Aβ and APOE ε4 genotype.
DISCUSSION: By highlighting the more significant role of tau, rather than Aβ, in the reduction of glucose metabolism, our results provide a better understanding of their combined effect in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study uses a data-driven singular value decomposition approach to the cross-correlation matrix between tau and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images, as well as between FDG and amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) images. From a population of mild cognitive impairment subjects, we found that spatially distributed scores of tau PET are associated with an even stronger reduction of glucose metabolism, independent of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype and confounded by Aβ. By highlighting the more significant role of tau, rather than Aβ, on the reduction of glucose metabolism, our results provide a better understanding of their combined effects in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimers Dement
40116690,Social functioning in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and the situation of caregivers.,"BackgroundChanges in social functioning may be a significant parameter for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, research on social functioning in AD across the entire spectrum of the disease is lacking.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to describe the social functioning of persons with AD at each stage of the disease and to investigate how impaired social functioning affects caregiver burden.MethodsCross-sectional data was derived from memory clinics across Germany as part of the pilot study ""Social functioning in individuals with AD and the situation of caregivers"". A total of N = 87 relatives providing care for individuals with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 40), and severe (n = 23) AD were included. Social functioning of individuals with AD was measured via the caregiver-rated German version of the Social Functioning in Dementia Scale (SF-DEM); caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-12). Differences between mild, moderate, and severe AD in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and the level of social functioning were examined. A robust linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between social functioning and caregiver burden.ResultsSocial functioning was lower in moderate and severe AD than in mild AD. Higher levels of social functioning were associated with less caregiver burden.ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of integrating social functioning assessments into clinical practice for improving the early detection, diagnosis and interventions for AD. Early interventions to enhance social functioning may diminish caregiver burden.",J Alzheimers Dis
40120616,"Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease: an open-label extension of the phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform DIAN-TU trial.","BACKGROUND: Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab.
METHODS: The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR [PiB-PET SUVR]) at 3 years, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat group (mITT; defined as participants who received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET SUVR assessment before gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE (NCT06424236) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.
FINDINGS: Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

40064964,Exploring a patient-specific in vitro pipeline for stratification and drug response prediction of microglia-based therapeutics.,"The scarcity of effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for predicting disease onset and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge. Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.",Sci Rep
40029926,Advanced strategies for enhancing the neuroprotective potential of curcumin: delivery systems and mechanistic insights in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Background: Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa, exhibits significant neuroprotective potential due to its diverse pharmacological properties.Objective: This review explores curcumin's role in modulating key pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington's Disease and Prion Disease.Methods: A comprehensive analysis of curcumin's molecular interactions, including its effects on amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and metal-induced neurotoxicity, was conducted. Additionally, strategies to overcome its low bioavailability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated.Results: Curcumin inhibits Aβ aggregation and promotes disaggregation, reducing amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. It modulates glial cell activity, attenuating neuroinflammation and fostering a neuroprotective environment. By interacting with tau proteins, curcumin prevents hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation. As a potent antioxidant, it scavenges reactive oxygen species, mitigating oxidative stress-related neuronal damage. Its metal-chelating properties further diminish neurotoxicity by sequestering iron and copper ions. Despite its limited bioavailability and BBB permeability, curcumin's therapeutic efficacy can be enhanced using nanocarriers such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, which improve solubility, stability, and brain penetration.Conclusion: Curcumin's multifaceted neuroprotective mechanisms make it a promising candidate for preventing or slowing neurodegenerative disease progression. Advanced drug delivery systems hold potential for overcoming its pharmacokinetic limitations, paving the way for future clinical applications.",Nutr Neurosci
40097862,The Effects and Mechanisms of n-3 and n-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Central Nervous System.,"The brain is rich in fatty acids (FAs), with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6, ARA), and the former predominantly stored in the form of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE, diacyl and plasma phospholipid proform), and phosphatidylserine (PS), while the latter is mainly found in ethanolamine phosphoglycerides (EPG) and contributes to constitute most of phosphoglycerides. When required by the body, PUFAs are liberated from membrane phospholipids (either directly or via their metabolites, which are generated by a series of enzymatic reactions) to participate in various cerebral physiological processes. PUFAs and their derivatives play crucial roles in modulating numerous bodily functions, including neuronal signal transmission, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and glucose uptake in the brain, thereby sustaining fundamental brain function. Although PUFAs have been implicated in a spectrum of neurological disorders, including acute brain injury (TBI), multiple sclerosis (MS), and neurodegenerative diseases, their role in conditions such as depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) is particularly noteworthy. These disorders are closely linked to critical brain functions, including cognition, memory, and inflammatory processes. Given the substantial body of research elucidating the involvement of PUFAs in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, this review will specifically concentrate on their impact within these contexts.",Cell Mol Neurobiol
40040121,Copula linked parallel ICA jointly estimates linked structural and functional MRI brain networks.,"Different brain imaging methods provide valuable insights, and their combination enhances understanding of the brain. Existing fusion approaches typically use precomputed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) features, such as amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, or functional network connectivity while linking fMRI and structural MRI (sMRI). The fusion step typically ignores the detailed temporal information available in the complete 4D fMRI. Motivated by prior work showing covarying sMRI networks resemble resting fMRI networks, we introduce a new technique called copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This innovative method simultaneously estimates independent sources and an unmixing matrix for each modality while also linking spatial sources through a copula model. We tested the effectiveness of CLiP-ICA in both a simulation and a real-data using fMRI and sMRI data from an Alzheimer study. Results showed significant linkage in several domains including cerebellum, sensorimotor and default mode. In sum, we provide an approach to simultaneously estimate and link independent components of fMRI and sMRI while preserving temporal information.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40006544,Advanced Nanopharmaceutical Intervention for the Reduction of Inflammatory Responses and the Enhancement of Behavioral Outcomes in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mouse Models.,"Background: The excessive accumulation of Aβ plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. However, the therapeutic potential of drugs like curcumin is often limited by low biocompatibility and BBB permeability. In this study, we developed a nanomaterial, BP-PEG-Tar@Cur, which was designed to enhance the biocompatibility of (curcumin) Cur, target Aβ, and augment BBB permeability through near-infrared (NIR) photothermal effects. Methods: Soluble Aβ, ThT fluorescence, and Aβ depolymerization fluorescence experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur to inhibit Aβ aggregation and dissociate Aβ fibrils. Cell uptake assays were performed to confirm the targeting ability of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur towards Aβ. In vitro mitochondrial ROS clearance and in vivo detection of inflammatory factors were used to assess the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of the nanodrug. Water maze behavioral experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of BP-PEG-Tar@Cur on spatial memory, learning ability, and behavioral disorders in AD mice. Results: The nanodrug effectively inhibited Aβ aggregation and dissociated Aβ fibrils in vitro. BP-PEG-Tar@Cur demonstrated efficiency in curbing ROS overproduction in mitochondria and dampening the activation of microglia and astrocytes triggered by Aβ aggregation. Water maze behavioral experiments revealed that BP-PEG-Tar@Cur enhanced spatial memory, learning ability, and alleviated behavioral disorders in AD mice. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings demonstrate that BP-PEG-Tar@Cur has the potential to be an effective targeted drug for inhibiting Aβ aggregation and improving cognitive impairment in AD mice.",Pharmaceutics

We examined variables to include in normative models for Mayo Test Drive (MTD, a multi-device remote cognitive assessment platform) measures, developed normative data, and validated the norms. Method: 1240 Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) adults ages 32-100 years (96% White) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center with Clinical Dementia Rating<sup>®</sup> of 0 were included. We converted raw scores to normalized scaled scores and derived regression-based normative data adjusting for age, age<sup>2</sup>, sex, and education (base model); alternative norms are also provided (age + age<sup>2</sup> + sex; age + age<sup>2</sup>). We assessed additional terms using an a priori cut-off of 1% variance improvement above the base model. We examined low test performance rates (&lt; -1 SD) in independent validation samples (n = 167 CU, n = 64 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 14 dementia). Rates were significantly different when 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not include the expected 14.7% base rate. Results: No model terms met the a priori cut-off beyond the base model, including device type, response input source (e.g. mouse, etc.), or session interference. Norms showed expected low performance rates in CU and greater rates of low performance in MCI and dementia in independent validation samples. Conclusion: Typical normative models appear appropriate for remote self-administered MTD measures and are sensitive to cognitive impairment. Device type and response input source did not explain enough variance for inclusion in normative models but are important for individual-level interpretation. Future work will increase the inclusion of individuals from under-represented groups.",Clin Neuropsychol

40142358,Targeting Neural Oscillations for Cognitive Enhancement in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is marked by progressive cognitive decline, affecting memory, language, orientation, and behavior. Pathological hallmarks include extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, which disrupt synaptic function and connectivity. Neural oscillations, the rhythmic synchronization of neuronal activity across frequency bands, are integral to cognitive processes but become dysregulated in AD, contributing to network dysfunction and memory impairments. Targeting these oscillations has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that specific frequency modulations can restore oscillatory balance, improve synaptic plasticity, and reduce amyloid and tau pathology. In animal models, interventions, such as gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), have shown efficacy in enhancing memory function and modulating neuroinflammatory responses. Clinical trials have reported promising cognitive improvements with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), particularly when targeting key hubs in memory-related networks, such as the default mode network (DMN) and frontal-parietal network. Moreover, gamma-tACS has been linked to increased cholinergic activity and enhanced network connectivity, which are correlated with improved cognitive outcomes in AD patients. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in optimizing stimulation parameters, individualizing treatment protocols, and understanding long-term effects. Emerging approaches, including transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) and closed-loop adaptive neuromodulation, hold promise for refining therapeutic strategies. Integrating neuromodulation with pharmacological and lifestyle interventions may maximize cognitive benefits. Continued interdisciplinary efforts are essential to refine these approaches and translate them into clinical practice, advancing the potential for neural oscillation-based therapies in AD.",Medicina (Kaunas)
40129019,Multianalyte Nanopore Detection of Alzheimer's Biomarkers: A Label-Free Platform with Improved Sensitivity and Range.,"Due to matrix interference, detection methods for protein biomarkers in body fluids are limited. Commonly used methods often require antibody modification or fluorescent labeling. Furthermore, subtle differences in protein sequences make it more challenging to detect and differentiate multiple biomarkers. This study introduces a novel nanopore-based method for simultaneous, label-free detection of key Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in biological samples. The technique enables distinguishable and ultrasensitive detection of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ<sub>42</sub>,Aβ<sub>40</sub>) amyloid precursor protein (APP<sub>669-711</sub>), and tubulin associated unit (Tau) proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. The method successfully identifies AD biomarkers by directly detecting Aβ<sub>42</sub> in cerebrospinal fluid and can detect age-dependent changes in Aβ levels in AD mice models, demonstrating reliability comparable to established enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays and brain plaque-staining confocal imaging. Notably, this method achieves significant advancements in detecting 2.1 pm Aβ<sub>42</sub> and 1.5 pm APP<sub>(669-711)</sub>, as well as 627 fm Aβ<sub>40</sub> in serum. This improvement in nanopore technology addresses the challenges of detecting Aβ and Tau alterations in complex biological samples and differentiating between similar protein sequences.

40153992,Targeting amyloidogenic proteins through cyclic peptides - A medicinal chemistry perspective.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the extracellular region, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the intracellular region accompanied with neuroinflammation and decreased neurotransmitters in various regions of brain leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Of the various bioactive molecules, Cyclic Peptides (CPs) are small circular chains of amino acids that can alter the structure and function of the proteins they interact with. They can be synthesized using chemical or genetic approach leading to the generation of diverse libraries of CPs that are screened for binding with desired target proteins. In AD, CPs can interfere at various levels, by either imitating the structure or altering the conformation of amyloidogenic proteins. They can also interfere with signal transduction by competing with amyloid proteins for various receptors which are involved in AD pathology. This review highlights the application of CPs as scaffolds for the identification of novel small molecules that can interfere with amyloid aggregation or for the formulation of vaccination against AD. Other proteins involved in the pathophysiological pathways of AD that can potentially be targeted for CP design have also been discussed.",Bioorg Med Chem
40149580,"Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: Clinical Presentation, Sequelae and Neuroimaging Features-An Update.","The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been shown to increase with age, with rates reported to be around 50-60% in individuals over 80 years old who have cognitive impairment. The disease often presents as spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which carries a high risk of recurrence, along with transient focal neurologic episodes (TFNE) and progressive cognitive decline, potentially leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to ICH, neuroradiologic findings of CAA include cortical and subcortical microbleeds (MB), cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS). Non-hemorrhagic pathologies include dilated perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale and multiple hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A definitive diagnosis of CAA still requires histological confirmation. The Boston criteria allow for the diagnosis of a probable or possible CAA by considering specific neurological and MRI findings. The recent version, 2.0, which includes additional non-hemorrhagic MRI findings, increases sensitivity while maintaining the same specificity. The characteristic MRI findings of autoantibody-related CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri) are similar to the so-called ""amyloid related imaging abnormalities"" (ARIA) observed with amyloid antibody therapies, presenting in two variants: (a) vasogenic edema and leptomeningeal effusions (ARIA-E) and (b) hemorrhagic lesions (ARIA-H). Clinical and MRI findings enable the diagnosis of a probable or possible CAA-ri, with biopsy remaining the gold standard for confirmation. In contrast to spontaneous CAA-ri, only about 20% of patients treated with monoclonal antibodies who show proven ARIA on MRI also experience clinical symptoms, including headache, confusion, other psychopathological abnormalities, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting. Recent findings indicate that treatment should be continued in cases of mild ARIA, with ongoing MRI and clinical monitoring. This review offers a concise update on CAA and its associated consequences.",Biomedicines
39989768,Newer Therapeutic Approaches in Treating Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related irreversible neurodegenerative disease affecting mostly the elderly population. The main pathological features of AD are the extracellular Aβ plaques generated by APP cleavage through the amyloidogenic pathway, the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) resulting from the hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and cholinergic neurodegeneration. However, the actual causes of AD are unknown, but several studies suggest hereditary mutations in PSEN1 and -2, APOE4, APP, and the TAU genes are the major perpetrators. In order to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of AD, various hypotheses are proposed. These include the following hypotheses: amyloid accumulation, tauopathy, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate/excitotoxicity, cholinergic deficiency, and gut dysbiosis. Currently approved therapeutic interventions are donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, which are cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), and memantine, which is an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. These treatment strategies focus on only symptomatic management of AD by attenuating symptoms but not regeneration of neurons or clearance of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau. This review focuses on the pathophysiology, novel therapeutic targets, and disease-altering treatments such as α-secretase modulators, active immunotherapy, passive immunotherapy, natural antioxidant products, nanomaterials, antiamyloid therapy, tau aggregation inhibitors, transplantation of fecal microbiota or stem cells, and microtubule stabilizers that are in clinical trials or still under investigation.",ACS Omega

39978449,Ditan Decoction ameliorates vascular dementia-induced cognitive dysfunction through anti-ferroptosis via the HIF1α pathway: Integrating network pharmacology and experimental validation.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vascular dementia (VaD) represents a frequently seen cognitive dysfunction syndrome and has ranks second among dementia subtypes following Alzheimer's disease. At present, Ditan Decoction (DTD), the traditional Chinese herbal prescription, is clinically applied in treating VaD. However, the material basis of its efficacy and therapeutic mechanism still remain unknown.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This experiment investigated the protection induced by DTD against VaD and the associated mechanism through network pharmacology, mass spectrometry analysis, and in vivo validation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We induced VaD in a rat model using bilateral common carotid artery ligation method (2-VO) and administered DTD at doses of 2.14, 4.28 and 8.55 g/kg, with Memantine (0.9 mg/kg) being the positive control. Following oral administration with DTD or Memantine for 4 weeks, behavioral tests were used for assessing cognitive function. H&E and Nissl staining was used for evaluating hippocampal pathology. TEM was used to visualize the ultrastructure of the hippocampal tissue. ELISA was carried out for measuring inflammatory factor levels in rat serum, and biochemical assays were employed to assess oxidative stress levels. Ferroptosis in the hippocampus was examined through analyzing corresponding biomarkers and protein expression. Additionally, HPLC-Q-Exactive-MS technology was employed for identifying DTD components, whereas network pharmacology was conducted for predicting DTD's targets for treating VaD. HIF1α expression levels were assessed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. We also further validated whether the protective effects of DTD on VaD were mediated through the HIF1α-regulated ferroptosis signaling pathway by using an HIF1α inhibitor in rats.
RESULTS: DTD demonstrated protective effects against 2VO-induced hippocampal injury through alleviating oxidative stress, lowering systemic inflammation, while preventing ferroptosis of hippocampal tissue. As revealed by network pharmacology, DTD probably executes its function in VaD by activating HIF1α pathway. According to immunofluorescence and Western blotting, DTD activated HIF1α within hippocampal tissue. Furthermore, DTD's protection against VaD and ferroptosis was reversed when an HIF1α inhibitor was applied.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that DTD rescued cognitive dysfunction in VaD by inhibiting ferroptosis via activating HIF1α pathway.",J Ethnopharmacol
40014269,Decoding the Role of Neurotrophins in Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3-Beta Regulation in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent contributor to dementia in elderly individuals. Numerous signalling pathways influencing AD pathophysiology, involving glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Gsk-3β), have been investigated extensively as potential therapeutic targets. Gsk-3β is a critical factor in AD pathogenesis that affects several key hallmarks of the disease notably tau phosphorylation, amyloid-β generation, cognition, neurogenesis, and synaptic integrity. Neurotrophins are small proteins that are critical for maintaining neuronal health and function and may be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the dysregulation of certain neurotrophins and their receptors is also linked with AD which is a major contributor to neurodegeneration. Studies indicated that neurotrophins and their modulators are capable of protecting neurons by blocking the Gsk-3β activity suggesting a potential link for neuroprotection. Neurotrophins support the survival of neurons by regulating Gsk-3β activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling pathways activate Trk receptors that trigger downstream signalling cascades that subsequently inhibit Gsk-3β activity and reduce AD-related neuropathology. We also explore the role of modulators including phosphatases, kinase cascades, and other regulatory proteins that cross paths with neurotrophin-Gsk-3β signalling. In conclusion, this manuscript summarizes both direct and indirect regulatory roles of neurotrophins and modulators on Gsk-3β to understand the intricate mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in AD.",Mol Neurobiol
40000185,[Classification of Alzheimer's disease based on multi-example learning and multi-scale feature fusion].,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification models usually segment the entire brain image into voxel blocks and assign them labels consistent with the entire image, but not every voxel block is closely related to the disease. To this end, an AD auxiliary diagnosis framework based on weakly supervised multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-scale feature fusion is proposed, and the framework is designed from three aspects: within the voxel block, between voxel blocks, and high-confidence voxel blocks. First, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network was used to extract deep features within the voxel block; then the spatial correlation information between voxel blocks was captured through position encoding and attention mechanism; finally, high-confidence voxel blocks were selected and combined with multi-scale information fusion strategy to integrate key features for classification decision. The performance of the model was evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework improved ACC and AUC by 3% and 4% on average compared with other mainstream frameworks in the two tasks of AD classification and mild cognitive impairment conversion classification, and could find the key voxel blocks that trigger the disease, providing an effective basis for AD auxiliary diagnosis.",Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi
40039646,Multi-class Prediction of Cognitively Normal / Mild Cognitive Impairment / Alzheimer's Disease Status in Dementia Based on Convolutional Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with insidious onset and progressive development. AD is a health issue that is attracting attention as the world's populations get older. Although there is currently no effective treatment for this disease, early diagnosis is necessary to help people prevent it. Here, we developed an MRI-based deep learning and multi-class AD classification and prediction framework. Based on the traditional Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19) architecture, we embedded the Convolutional Block Attention Module Attention layer to build an Alzheimer's directional prediction 3D convolution model referred to as AD_Net in this paper. We used MRI images from the ADNI open data resource to train, classify, and predict three different conditions: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN). Experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy and system robustness of AD_Net are superior to those of basic VGG19. To improve the accuracy of the prediction, we developed a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model to incorporate additional factors into the model, such as age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. We presented the model performance for groups with and without directional influence factors. Accuracy for the two groups was 51.2% and 89%, respectively. The latter group had a standard deviation as low as 1.8%, reflecting predictive performance that is both good and stable. Our model can be applied to the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other similar conditions that can be diagnosed by MRI and the patient's underlying factors.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
39985130,"Kinetic Steering of Amyloid Formation and Polymorphism by Canagliflozin, a Type-2 Diabetes Drug.","Amyloid formation is involved in widespread health conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type-2 diabetes. Amyloid fibrils have a similar cross-β architecture, but fibrils formed by a single protein sequence can have diverse structures, varying with time, self-assembly conditions, and sequence modifications. Fibril structure has been proposed to be diagnostic of disease, but why different structures result under different conditions, especially in vitro, remains elusive. We previously identified a small molecule, YX-I-1, which inhibits in vitro amyloid formation by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a peptide hormone whose amyloid formation is involved in type-2 diabetes. Here, using YX-I-1 as a lead, we identified regulator-approved drugs with similar structures by chemical similarity analysis and substructure searches and monitored the effect of 24 of these potential ligands on IAPP amyloid assembly in vitro. We show that one such compound, canagliflozin (Invokana), a type-2 diabetes drug already in clinical use, can strongly delay the kinetics of IAPP amyloid formation, an activity independent of its intended mode of action [sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor] that may have important therapeutic implications. Combining analysis of amyloid self-assembly kinetics, biophysical characterization of monomer and fibril binding, and cryo-EM of the assembly products, we show that YX-I-1 and canagliflozin target IAPP early in aggregation, remodeling the energy landscape of primary nucleation and profoundly altering the resulting fibril structures. Early binding events thus imprint long-lasting effects on the amyloid structures that form.",J Am Chem Soc
40101029,Traditional Chinese medicine as a viable option for managing vascular cognitive impairment: A ray of hope.,"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a prevalent cognitive disorder resulting from cerebrovascular disease and encompasses a spectrum of cognitive deficits, ranging from mild impairment to vascular dementia (VD). VCI is responsible for a minimum of 20% to 40% of all cases of dementia, with its prevalence ranking second only to Alzheimer's disease on a global scale. The pathogenesis of VCI is complex and includes a lack of cholinergic nerve cells, inflammation, oxidative stress, alterations in the blood-brain barrier, and cell apoptosis. Current guideline-recommended drugs have unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. However, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been associated with treating dementia, and numerous studies regarding treating dementia with TCM have been conducted. The etiology and pathogenesis of VaD are linked to deficiencies in the spleen and kidney, as well as phlegm turbidity. Treatment involves benefiting the spleen and kidney, improving blood circulation, removing blood stasis, and dispelling phlegm. Moreover, TCM presents benefits such as few adverse effects, low cost, long-term use suitability, and preventive effects. This review outlines the pathogenesis of VCI in both modern medicine and TCM, examines traditional prescriptions and single-agent ingredients with their pharmacological effects, emphasizes TCM's unique features, and explores its multi-targeted approach to treating VCI.",Medicine (Baltimore)
39995734,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using transfer learning with multi-modal 3D Inception-v4.,"BACKGROUND: Deep learning (DL) technologies are playing increasingly important roles in computer-aided diagnosis in medicine. In this study, we sought to address issues related to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on multi-modal features, and introduced a multi-modal three-dimensional Inception-v4 model that employs transfer learning for AD diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical score data.
METHODS: The multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) Inception-v4 model was first pre-trained using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Subsequently, independent validation data were used to fine-tune the model with pre-trained weight parameters. The model was quantitatively evaluated using the mean values obtained from five-fold cross-validation. Further, control experiments were conducted to verify the performance of the model patients with AD, and in the study of disease progression.
RESULTS: In the AD diagnosis task, when a single image marker was used, the average accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC) were 62.21% and 71.87%, respectively. When transfer learning was not employed, the average ACC and AUC were 75.74% and 83.13%, respectively. Conversely, the combined approach proposed in this study achieved an average ACC of 87.84%, and an average AUC of 90.80% [with an average precision (PRE) of 87.21%, an average recall (REC) of 82.52%, and an average F1 of 83.58%].
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with existing methods, the performance of the proposed method was superior in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, the method showed an enhanced ability to accurately distinguish among various stages of AD. Our findings show that multi-modal feature fusion and transfer learning can be valuable resources in the treatment of patients with AD, and in the study of disease progression.",Quant Imaging Med Surg

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction are potential factors of cognitive deficits in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes, traumatic brain injury (TBI), vascular dementia (VAD), and schizophrenia. NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors have received increased interest due to their unique molecular structure targets antioxidant and inflammatory pathways and mitochondrial function. The PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched through May 30, 2024. Studies investigating the effect of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors on cognitive impairments in rodent models were included. Two reviewers independently extracted and evaluated the data. The PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews were followed. Thirty preclinical studies were included in the review. Studies have revealed that treatment with NAD<sup>+</sup> rescues cognitive deficits by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis and improving mitochondrial function. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that treatment with NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors may be more effective in learning and memory recovery in AD, TBI, diabetes, aging, VAD, and schizophrenia. The outcomes of this investigation may lead to additional studies on the use of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors for treating human cognitive decline.",BMC Neurosci
40010433,Investigation of Domain Interaction in the Apolipoprotein E Isoforms by HDX-MS.,"Involvement of apoE4 in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to arise from its unique structural properties, most importantly the interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains. However, structural understanding of the domain interaction is still lacking. Here, we use Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) to study domain interactions by measuring the effect of the C-terminal domain (CTD) on the solvent accessibility of the N-terminal domain (NTD) in both apoE3 and apoE4. Our results indicate that the presence of CTD enhances the solvent accessibility of all the four helices in the NTD in apoE4, but only two helices, specifically Helix-1 and 4 in apoE3. Therefore, the allosteric changes in the conformational ensemble of the NTD induced by the CTD is more extensive in apoE4 than in apoE3. Moreover, strong pH dependence suggests role of the salt bridges in the interdomain interactions. Since the NTD harbors the receptor binding region, the destabilizing effect of CTD on it provides a structural basis for the role of interdomain interactions on the pathological functions of apoE4. Furthermore, we propose HDX-MS as a methodology for screening and assessing the efficacy of 'structure corrector' molecules targeting apoE4 to mitigate its pathological effects in AD.",J Mol Biol

Associations between CSF LMO4 and AD biomarkers (Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Ptau181, amyloid PET) and postmortem neuropathology were evaluated. We also explored cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between CSF LMO4 and neurodegeneration and cognitive function. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CSF LMO4 in distinguishing Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative participants and amyloid PET-confirmed AD cases. Mediation analysis explored the potential mediating role of CSF LMO4 between Aβ pathology and tau pathology.ResultsLMO4 levels were decreased in participants with abnormal Aβ levels and cognitive impairment. Lower CSF LMO4 levels were associated with increased Aβ and tau pathology, brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and postmortem neuropathology. CSF LMO4 partially mediated the relationship between Aβ and tau pathology and demonstrated acceptable discriminative ability in distinguishing Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative participants and amyloid PET-confirmed AD from non-AD cases.ConclusionsCSF LMO4 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD and may represent a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",J Alzheimers Dis
40010329,Locus Coeruleus sexual dimorphism and its impact on cognitive impairment and cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Experimental data suggest sexual dimorphism in the Locus Coeruleus (LC), with females exhibiting higher neuronal count and noradrenergic activity. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), progressive LC dysfunction may contribute early to pathogenesis, and female sex is a key risk factor for AD. This study aimed to investigate if such sex differences exist in humans and whether they influence the relationship between LC degeneration and AD features, such as cortical atrophy and cognitive decline.
METHODS: Fifty-three healthy controls (HC), 70 Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI) subjects, and 29 Alzheimer's Disease Demented (ADD) patients underwent high-field brain MRI with LC-sensitive sequences following detailed neuropsychological and neurological assessments. LC integrity was measured using the LC Contrast Ratio (LCCR) parameter based on a previously published template approach.
RESULTS: Within the HC and MCI groups, females showed higher LCCR values than males. A significant sex effect was observed in the relationship between LC integrity and cortical volume in the frontotemporal cortices, with males showing a stronger association.
CONCLUSION: LC structure and function may differ between sexes, influencing AD pathophysiology through distinct mechanisms. While this sexual dimorphism may have a minor role, it should be considered in clinical investigations and drug development research.",Neurodegener Dis
40165839,Cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels affect electroencephalographic activity in Alzheimer's disease.,"To investigate the role of neuroinflammation as mediator of amyloid-β-induced cortical activity changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examined the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-α, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, G-CSF, MIP-1α, MCP-1) and electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in a cohort of biologically defined AD patients (n = 55, M:F = 19:36, median age 73, Mini-Mental State Examination ≥ 22). We retrieved a positive association between IL-4 CSF levels and EEG background activity frequency; IL-7, IL-8, and IL-12 CSF levels were positively associated with the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges. Neuroinflammation accompanying AD pathology may enhance the amyloid's epileptogenic potential while also counteracting neurodegenerative damage.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40025717,Association of mid-age Life's Essential 8 score with digital cognitive performance and incident Alzheimer's disease: The Framingham Heart Study.,"BackgroundCardiovascular health (CVH) is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies examining the association between mid-age CVH, as indicated by Life's Essential 8 (LE8) health metrics, and digital cognitive performance or AD risk are limited.ObjectiveTo examine the associations between mid-age CVH, assessed by LE8 scores during ages 45 to 65, and digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) performance as well as the incidence of AD.MethodsWe included 1198 participants (51.6% women) from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. Linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the associations between mid-age CVH and dCDT performance, as well as the incidence of AD.ResultsOver a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 45 participants developed AD. Each standard deviation (SD) higher mid-age LE8 total score was associated with a 0.16 SD higher level of the dCDT total score (p < 0.001) and a 0.35-fold lower risk of incident AD (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p = 0.003). The dCDT measures showed stronger associations with mid-age LE8 and AD risk compared to the conventional CDT (cCDT). For example, the drawing score on copy tasks was more strongly associated with LE8 (beta = 0.10, p = 0.007 versus beta = 0.08, p = 0.27) and had higher discrimination for incident AD (C-statistic = 0.89 versus 0.83) compared to the cCDT.ConclusionsOur results highlight the potential of digital cognitive assessments for evaluating AD risk and emphasize the importance of mid-age CVH in shaping cognitive outcomes and the development of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40072737,"Brain Health Attitudes, Awareness and Actions in Middle-Aged Latinos.","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately impact Latinos in the US. Interventions that promote engagement in established protective behaviors throughout the life course may offer an opportunity to address disparities. To inform brain health promotion efforts, this study aimed to examine current brain health-related attitudes, awareness, and actions of middle-aged Latinos. A cross-sectional, online survey was completed by 200 Latinos 35-64 years old. Survey items assessed concern about ADRD, beliefs related to ways to support brain health, knowledge of protective behaviors, and actual engagement in protective behaviors. Multivariable analyses examined differences in knowledge, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes by sociodemographic and psychosocial factors including health literacy and health activation. A third (36.0%) of participants were ""very concerned"" about ADRD. Nearly two thirds (61.0%) ""strongly agreed"" steps can be taken to reduce risk of ADRD. Less than a third (29.5%) were able to name three steps to support brain health, and 45.5% reported currently engaging in behaviors to support brain health. In multivariable analyses, participants with lower acculturation were more likely to be ""very concerned"" about ADRD and to ""strongly agree"" that steps can be taken to support brain health. Participants with low health activation were less likely to agree that steps can be taken. Those who were older and had a family member with ADRD were more likely to be able to name three steps that can be taken. Most middle-aged Latinos believed brain health is actionable, while concern for ADRD, awareness of ways to protect the brain, and engagement in science-based protective behaviors was variable. Opportunities exist for increasing education about well-established modifiable risk factors for ADRD, yet more research is needed to understand these factors in historically minoritized communities.",J Immigr Minor Health
40155985,Multivariate longitudinal clustering reveals neuropsychological factors as dementia predictors in an Alzheimer's disease progression study.,"Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various cognitive and behavioral decline factors. In this work, we propose an extension of the traditional k-means clustering for multivariate time series data to cluster joint trajectories of different features describing progression over time. The algorithm we propose here enables the joint analysis of various longitudinal features to explore co-occurring trajectory factors among markers indicative of cognitive decline in individuals participating in an AD progression study. By examining how multiple variables co-vary and evolve together, we identify distinct subgroups within the cohort based on their longitudinal trajectories. Our clustering method enhances the understanding of individual development across multiple dimensions and provides deeper medical insights into the trajectories of cognitive decline. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also able to make a selection of the most significant features in separating clusters by considering trajectories over time. This process, together with a preliminary pre-processing on the OASIS-3 dataset, reveals an important role of some neuropsychological factors. In particular, the proposed method has identified a significant profile compatible with a syndrome known as Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI), displaying behavioral manifestations of individuals that may precede the cognitive symptoms typically observed in AD patients. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple longitudinal features in clinical modeling, ultimately supporting more effective and individualized patient management strategies.",BioData Min
40059298,The Use of Natural Volatile Compounds on the Fibrillation Domain of Amyloid Beta (GSNKGAIIGLM)─Towards Promising Agents to Combat Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is caused by the accumulation of amyloid-beta, is a major medical concern today. Controlling these aggregates is critical to drug development, but delivering them effectively into the bloodstream poses significant challenges. In this context, aromatherapy has been proposed as an innovative and promising approach for AD disease. The volatile compounds cinnamaldehyde, phenylethyl alcohol, α-asarone, and β-caryophyllene have neuroprotective effects that can be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like AD. The amyloid-beta (Aβ) fragment (25-35), which retains the properties of the full-length Aβ is used as a suitable model to evaluate the potential toxicity associated with AD. This study investigated the effects of the four mentioned volatile compounds at four different concentrations on the fibrillation process of the Aβ (25-35) peptide. Structural changes in the peptide have been analyzed using various techniques such as fluorescence probing, far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fluorescence probing results showed that these compounds can effectively prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils by forming chemical bonds with the intermediate species. CD spectroscopy results indicated a decrease in β-sheet content of fibrils and confirmed the effect of pH on structural changes. AFM analysis revealed that volatile compounds effectively prevented the formation of amyloid fibrils at different concentrations and changed the average size of intermediates and oligomeric species. These findings show a promising future for AD patients and emphasize the importance of natural compounds in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.",ACS Chem Neurosci
40091588,Characterization of subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults with subjective cognitive decline progressing to objective cognitive impairment: A prospective 4-year follow-up study.,"BackgroundSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) is linked to a more rapid progression to the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). SCD has been correlated with affective symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Recent research aimed to shed light on the relationship between these affective symptoms and how they might correlate to a more rapid progression to objective cognitive impairment. No studies have assessed the presence, type, and intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms between SCD individuals who progressed versus those who did not.ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish whether there are differences between subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms in terms of presence, type, and intensity of symptoms presented by individuals with SCD who progressed to an objective cognitive decline.MethodsThe recruited participants originated from the Consortium for the Early Identification of Alzheimer's Disease - Québec (CIMA-Q) cohort. They were assessed twice, with an interval of 4 years separating the evaluations. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and depression symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30).ResultsThe presence, type and intensity of anxiety symptoms did not significantly distinguish the two groups. Only one type of hopelessness-related depressive symptom was significantly higher in SCD participants who had progressed to objective cognitive decline compared with those who had not.ConclusionsOur results suggest that it may be beneficial to target hopelessness in non-pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing the progression of people with SCD to MCI or AD.",J Alzheimers Dis

However, little is known regarding the clinical, healthcare system-level, and patient-specific barriers that hinder timely diagnosis and treatment.ObjectiveTo explore real-world practices surrounding the diagnostic journey and management of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD dementia patients.MethodsData were drawn from Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease Specific Programme™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians treating MCI/AD dementia patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan between 2022 and 2024.ResultsOverall, 779 physicians reported data on 5551 patients. Physicians indicated current disease severity for 5421 patients; 37.2% had MCI (87.3% with suspected prodromal AD and 12.7% undetermined etiology), 17.2% AD with mild dementia, 31.1% AD with moderate dementia, and 14.5% AD with severe dementia. When not immediately diagnosed, the median time from first consultation to initial diagnosis was 8.9 and 12.6 weeks when patients first consulted and were diagnosed by either a primary care practitioner (PCP) or a specialist, respectively, compared with 21.6 weeks when a PCP referred to a specialist for diagnosis. Diagnostic delays were predominantly due to specialist wait times. Few patients had diagnostic AD biomarker tests (cerebrospinal fluid testing 9.5%, amyloid positron emission tomography 3.7%, AD-blood tests 5.3%).ConclusionsTimely MCI and AD diagnosis is impeded by referral delays and limited use of biomarker testing.

40133235,Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prevent presymptomatic capillary flow disturbances in a model of cerebral amyloidosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Disturbances in microvascular flow dynamics are hypothesized to precede the symptomatic phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, evidence in presymptomatic AD remains elusive, underscoring the need for therapies targeting these early vascular changes.
METHODS: We employed a multimodal approach, combining in vivo optical imaging, molecular techniques, and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, to investigate early capillary dysfunction in C57BL/6-Tg(Thy1-APPSwDutIowa)BWevn/Mmjax (Tg-SwDI) mice without memory impairment. We also assessed the efficacy of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in preventing capillary flow disturbances.
RESULTS: Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and amyloid beta (Aβ) load in 9- to 10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice without memory impairment. CAI treatment ameliorated these capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen availability, and reduced Aβ load.
DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow disturbances as early biomarkers in presymptomatic AD and highlight the potential of CAIs for preserving vascular integrity in the early stages of AD.

Recent evidence indicates that inflammation plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, with elevated inflammatory markers and risk genes linked to innate immune functions. Glial cell dysfunction, particularly in astrocytes and microglia, is crucial to the neuroinflammatory process, contributing to oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and impaired neurogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of benfotiamine (BFT), a vitamin B1 analogue, on microglial morphology, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters in a sporadic Alzheimer-like disease model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Supplementation with 150 mg/kg of BFT for 7 days significantly reduced inflammation in the hippocampus and provided protection against oxidative damage in the entorhinal cortex by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD1 and CAT.

40034363,Retinal vascular changes are associated with PET-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Retina is a non-invasive channel for assessing changes in brain microvasculature, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies revealed significant relationship between clinically diagnosed AD and retinal vasculature. However, clinical diagnosis has limited sensitivity and specificity, and those investigations were conducted from traditional retinal fundus photographs which only captured a narrow section of the fundus.
OBJECTIVE: Determining changes in retinal vasculature from larger area of retina between subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker-confirmed AD compared to controls.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community and cognitive disorder clinics. Diagnosis of AD was confirmed by significant amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau uptake on PET scan. Retinal vasculature was imaged with ultra-widefield (UWF) scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and a series of vessel parameters were quantified using the semi-automated Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender and systolic blood pressure. In addition, arteriole parameters were adjusted against the same measurements in venules, and vice versa.
RESULTS: Out of the 39 patients, 18 had radiologically confirmed AD. These individuals with AD showed significantly smaller arteriolar fractal dimension (p = 0.032) in UWF images and greater venular tortuosity (p = 0.011) in standard fundus images compared with controls. Presence of significant Aβ and tau burden was associated with lower arteriolar caliber (OR 3.857; 95% CI 1.014-14.67; p = 0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of fractal dimension in retinal arterioles observed in UWF imaging is associated with cerebral Aβ and tau burden in people with biomarker-confirmed AD. Wide field retinal imaging provides an alternative perspective in demonstrating microvascular alterations related to AD in this pilot study.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40096746,"Investigating the therapeutic potential of 1,2,3,4,6 penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose in Alzheimer's disease: a scoping review.","The gallotannin 1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-Galloyl-β-D-Glucose (β-PGG) has recently garnered scientific interest due to its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction, accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ), tau and metal ions, may benefit from β-PGG interventions. This review synthesises existing literature to explore the therapeutic potential of β-PGG in AD. Experimental evidence suggests that β-PGG can suppress pro-inflammatory mediator release and inhibit NF-κB and MAPK signalling pathways, both critical in AD progression. In vitro studies highlight β-PGG's ability to scavenge free radicals, enhance antioxidant enzyme function, and prevent lipid peroxidation, well-known phenomena in AD. Additionally, neuroprotection may be conferred by β-PGG's capacity to reduce metal ion accumulation, inhibit Aβ and tau aggregation, and modulate cholinergic neurotransmission in vitro. In summary, while β-PGG shows promise in targeting AD hallmarks in vitro, further in vivo studies are crucial to validate its therapeutic potential.",Nat Prod Res
40079311,Cerebral Hemodynamic Impairment and Cognitive Dysfunction in APOE4 Carriers With Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis/Occlusion.,"BACKGROUND: Our previous preclinical study demonstrated that APOE4-targeted replacement mice exhibit more severe cerebral hypoperfusion and cognitive impairment than APOE3-targeted replacement mice with carotid artery stenosis due to neurovascular dysfunction. Therefore, we clinically investigate whether APOE4 contributes to cerebral hemodynamic and cognitive impairment in subjects with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis or occlusion.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2022. In a primary analysis, 91 subjects (114 affected cerebral hemispheres) with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis or occlusion who underwent neuropsychological examinations and <sup>15</sup>O-gas positron emission tomography were included to examine associations of APOE4 with cognitive impairment and cerebral hemodynamic impairment. A sensitivity analysis was performed with 161 subjects (201 affected cerebral hemispheres) who underwent <sup>15</sup>O-gas positron emission tomography scan. In the primary analysis, 20 (22.0%) subjects were APOE4 carriers. APOE4 was an independent risk factor of lower cerebral blood flow in the anterior circulation territory (β=-0.058 [95% CI, -0.098 to -0.018], P=0.005) and short-term memory impairment in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (β=1.16 [95% CI, 0.009-2.30], P=0.048) in a multivariable linear regression analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, 31 (19.3%) subjects carried APOE4, which was an independent risk factor of lower cerebral blood flow (β=-0.048 [95% CI, -0.079 to -0.012], P=0.003) in the anterior circulation territory.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE4 may confer an increased risk of decreased cerebral blood flow accompanied by memory impairment in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis or occlusion consistent with our experimental study. APOE genotyping in such subjects may be useful for early detection of disease severity.",J Am Heart Assoc
40138617,The Social Vulnerability Index and Incidence of Alzheimer Disease in a Population-Based Sample of Older Adults.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The primary study objective was to examine the association between Social Vulnerability index (SVI) and risk of incident Alzheimer disease (AD) and rate of cognitive decline.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a population-based cohort study. Participants were recruited through door visits, were at least 65 years of age at enrollment, and lived in one of 4 Chicago communities representing 24 US census tracts. The association of SVI with clinically diagnosed incident AD was examined using a logistic regression model and global cognitive decline using a linear mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 6,781 participants were in this study, with a mean age of 72 years, representing over 60% Black participants and over 60% female participants, and with a mean of 12 years of education. Over 90% of Black participants were in tracts above 50% or higher SVI, and approximately 87% of White participants were in tracts with SVI 50% or less. Participants in tracts with SVI above 50th to 75th percentiles had OR = 2.23 (95% CI 1.23-4.05) for clinical AD, and participants in tracts greater than the 75th percentile had OR = 2.04 (95% CI 1.03-4.04). Participants in more vulnerable tracts had greater incident AD risk than participants in less vulnerable tracts. The annual rate of global cognitive decline was 0.055 SD units (SDU) for participants below the 25th SVI percentile. The annual rate of global cognitive decline was faster by 0.010 SDU (approximately 18% faster, p = 0.025) in those above the 50th-75th percentile and by 0.014 SDU (approximately 25% faster, p = 0.005) in participants above the 75th percentile than in participants below the 25th SVI percentile.
DISCUSSION: Most Black participants who lived in areas with higher SVI that had over twice the risk of incident AD than most White participants who lived in areas with lower SVI, showing a higher social burden in Black older adults. There was no statistically significant race difference in incident AD after adjusting for SVI. SVI should be accounted for when examining race differences in AD.",Neurology
40117459,Design and Development of a Novel BET Protein-Targeted PET Imaging Probe for In Vivo Characterization of Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology.,"BET proteins are essential epigenetic regulators involved in gene transcription and have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vivo imaging of BET proteins may provide insights into disease pathophysiology and help identify potential therapeutic targets. We developed a carbon-<sup>11</sup>-labeled radiotracer, [<sup>11</sup>C]YL9, which exhibits high binding affinity for BET proteins. It was synthesized via standard methylation and evaluated for brain uptake, binding specificity, and pharmacokinetics in wild-type and AD mouse models using PET imaging and autoradiography. [<sup>11</sup>C]YL9 demonstrated excellent blood-brain barrier penetration, prolonged retention, and strong BET protein binding. In AD mice, [<sup>11</sup>C]YL9 uptake was significantly higher than in wild-type mice, suggesting increased BET protein availability. These findings suggest that [<sup>11</sup>C]YL9 is a promising PET radioligand for noninvasive BET protein imaging. Its high specificity and favorable pharmacokinetics make it a valuable tool for studying BET protein involvement in neurodegeneration.",J Med Chem

Neuropathological findings suggest a mixed etiology in many AD patients, and vascular pathology is common.ObjectiveThis study tested the interactive effect of APOE status and multiple vascular comorbidities on white matter (WM) microstructure in aging and early AD.Methods195 participants from the VPH-DARE@IT dataset were stratified in low/high vascular burden based on the Framingham Risk Score (BMI version). Tract-based spatial statistics was used for WM analyses.ResultsThere was a main effect of APOE, with APOE ɛ4 carriers having higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower axial diffusivity (AxD), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) than non-carriers. There was a main effect of vascular burden with lower FA and higher AxD, MD, and RD in the high-burden than the low-burden group. A significant interaction between APOE genotype and vascular burden was also found for all diffusion indices. Post-hoc comparisons revealed lower left hemisphere WM integrity when comparing the low risk group (i.e., non-carriers low burden) to intermediate risk groups (i.e., non-carriers high burden or ɛ4 carriers low burden). The contrasts between the two intermediate risk groups showed altered WM integrity bilaterally. Only the non-carriers high burden showed greater alterations in WM integrity when compared with the high risk group (i.e., ɛ4 carriers high burden) mainly in right hemisphere tracts.ConclusionsThese findings indicate an interactive effect of a risk gene and vascular comorbidities on WM integrity in aging and early AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40052563,Visual-somatosensory integration as a novel behavioral marker of amyloid pathology.,"INTRODUCTION: The ability to integrate information across sensory modalities is a vital aspect of everyday functioning and is linked to cognition. Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology manifests in sensory association areas before appearing in higher-order cognitive areas. We examined the role of visual-somatosensory integration (VSI) as a novel behavioral marker of AD-associated amyloid pathology.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 243 adults (77 ± 6.5 years; 52% female) who completed the VSI test and AD biomarker assays. The magnitude of VSI was the independent variable and amyloid-beta probability scores (APS; PrecivityAD<sup>TM</sup>) were the dependent variable. Cognitive status (normal, mild cognitive impairment, or AD) was assigned during case conferences.
RESULTS: Linear regression revealed an inverse association between the magnitude of VSI and APS (β = -0.16; p ≤ 0.01). As cognitive impairment increased from normal to dementia, the magnitude of VSI decreased (p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Findings provide support for VSI impairment as a new behavioral marker of AD-associated amyloid pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Here we provide support for the magnitude of VSI as a novel behavioral marker of AD-associated amyloid pathology given its significant association with an established, accurate, and reliable biomarker of AD pathology. Adults with normal cognition maintained the highest magnitude of VSI and brain amyloid negative scores. As cognitive impairment increased, the mean magnitude of VSI significantly decreased while amyloid probability scores (APS) increased. In fact, individuals with dementia revealed the lowest magnitude of VSI and the highest APS. Our research continues to emphasize the importance of successful multisensory integration in aging, where the establishment of future novel multisensory-based interventions aimed at preventing disability and optimizing independence could prove valuable.",Alzheimers Dement
39997032,CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cell Counts in Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"PURPOSE: To assess the presence and quantity of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a meta-analysis.
METHODS: A systematic search of the databases identified the observational and interventional studies reporting baseline CD34+ cell counts in AD patients. The data on mean counts and the measures of variation were extracted. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated using common and random effects models to compare the CD34+ cell counts between the AD patients and controls. Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated using tau<sup>2</sup>, tau, and I<sup>2</sup> statistics. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the ROBINS-I tool.
PATIENTS: Five studies were included, comprising four observational studies and one open-label trial, with a total of 271 participants (139 AD patients and 132 controls).
RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated an increase in CD34+ cell counts of the AD patients when compared to the controls. The common effects model showed a moderate SMD of 0.2964 (95% CI:0.0490-0.5437). However, the random effects model yielded a non-significant SMD of 0.2326 (95% CI: -0.4832-0.9484). Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 87.1%, p &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: AD patients may exhibit higher circulating CD34+ cell counts than the controls, but substantial heterogeneity and potential biases limit definitive conclusions.",Diseases
40140960,Blood-brain barrier disruption: a pervasive driver and mechanistic link between traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has emerged as a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex and devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Both conditions share a common feature: blood‒brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, which is believed to play a pivotal role in linking TBI to the development of AD. This review delves into the intricate relationship between TBI and AD, with a focus on BBB dysfunction and its critical role in disease mechanisms and therapeutic development. We first present recent evidence from epidemiological studies highlighting the increased incidence of AD among individuals with a history of TBI, as well as pathological and animal model studies that demonstrate how TBI can accelerate AD-like pathology. Next, we explore the mechanisms by which BBB dysfunction may mediate TBI-induced AD pathology. Finally, we investigate the shared molecular pathways associated with BBB dysfunction in both TBI and AD conditions and discuss the latest findings on how targeting these pathways and employing regenerative approaches, such as stem cell therapy and pharmacological interventions, can enhance BBB function and mitigate neurodegeneration.",Transl Neurodegener
40150131,A Novel Diagnostic Framework with an Optimized Ensemble of Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Alzheimer's Disease Detection in Medical Imaging.,"Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, which causes memory loss and loss of cognitive functioning, along with behavioral changes. Early detection is important to delay disease progression, timely intervention and to increase patients' and caregivers' quality of life (QoL). One of the major and primary challenges for preventing any disease is to identify the disease at the initial stage through a quick and reliable detection process. Different researchers across the world are still working relentlessly, coming up with significant solutions. Artificial intelligence-based solutions are putting great importance on identifying the disease efficiently, where deep learning with medical imaging is highly being utilized to develop disease detection frameworks. In this work, a novel and optimized detection framework has been proposed that comes with remarkable performance that can classify the level of Alzheimer's accurately and efficiently. Methods: A powerful vision transformer model (ViT-B16) with three efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (VGG19, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetV2B3) has been trained with a benchmark dataset, 'OASIS', that comes with a high volume of brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI).

40073763,Ginsenoside Rg1 improves autophagy dysfunction to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease via targeting FGR proto-oncogene.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegeneration driven by beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in the brain involving autophagy dysfunction. Ginsenoside Rg1, a pharmacologically active compound found in ginseng, has possible therapeutic effects for AD. This study discovered that FGR proto-oncogene (FGR) was a therapeutic target of Rg1 in AD and it was possibly involved in autophagy. C57BL/6 J mice were injected with 5 μL (1 μg/mL) Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in the right lateral ventricle to establish an AD model. AD mouse hippocampus had high FGR expression. Intragastrically administered Rg1 (40 mg/kg) decreased FGR protein levels in AD mice's hippocampus and improved memory function in AD mice. Both sides of the mice hippocampal fissure were administered with 2 μL lentiviral particles (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> TU) containing FGR overexpression plasmids. FGR overexpression rendered Rg1 ineffectual in restoring memory function and reducing hippocampal neuron damage. We injected 2 μL lentiviral particles (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> TU) containing short hairpin RNA plasmids targeting FGR to the mice hippocampal fissures. FGR knockdown improved spatial memory function of AD mice, reduced hippocampal neuron apoptosis, and prevented Aβ accumulation. HT22 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting FGR. FGR knockdown increased the viability of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treated HT22 cells. BACE1 and LC3II/I protein levels were decreased and p62 and SIRT1 were increased in AD mice and cells with FGR knockdown. LC3 was down-regulated after inhibiting FGR expression in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treated hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, Rg1 exerts anti-AD functions by targeting FGR and downregulating its expression.",Neuropeptides
40033338,How the gut microbiota impacts neurodegenerative diseases by modulating CNS immune cells.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles are two key histological features resulting in progressive and irreversible neuronal loss and cognitive decline. The macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) belong to the innate immune system and comprise parenchymal microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) at the CNS interfaces (leptomeninges, perivascular space and choroid plexus). Microglia and CAMs have received attention as they may play a key role in disease onset and progression e. g., by clearing amyloid beta (Aβ) through phagocytosis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that human microglia and CAMs express numerous risk genes for AD, further highlighting their potentially critical role in AD pathogenesis. Microglia and CAMs are tightly controlled by environmental factors, such as the host microbiota. Notably, it was further reported that the composition of the gut microbiota differed between AD patients and healthy individuals. Hence, emerging studies have analyzed the impact of gut bacteria in different preclinical mouse models for AD as well as in clinical studies, potentially enabling promising new therapeutic options.",J Neuroinflammation

This study reports an Aβ 1-42 induced 3D Alzheimer's disease modeling utilizing differentiated SH-SY5Y spheroids, which is carried out by Magnetic levitation approach, and the neuroprotective effect of Curcumin is further investigated on this model. For this purpose, SH-SY5Y spheroids are differentiated using Retinoic acid-Brain-derived neurotrophic factor sequentially during 3D cell culture. Differentiated spheroids maintained high viability and exhibited significant neuronal characteristics, as evidenced by increasing β-III tubulin and NeuN expressions. 3D Alzheimer's disease model formation and neurotoxicity of Aβ 1-42 aggregates are investigated on un-/differentiated spheroids, resulting in 65% and 51% cell viability, respectively. Characterization of the 3D Alzheimer's disease model is done by immunostaining of Choline acetyltransferase to investigate cholinergic neuron activity loss, showing a 2.2 decrease in fluorescence intensity. Further, Curcumin treatment on the 3D Alzheimer's disease model resulted in augmenting cell viability, confirming neuroprotective effect of Curcumin on Aβ 1-42 induced Alzheimer's disease model.

40099247,Modulated theta band frequency with binaural beat stimulation correlates with improved cognitive scores in Alzheimer's patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 50 million individuals worldwide, a number projected to triple by 2050. Due to discomfort through electrical and magnetic neuromodulation technologies, this is the first study to propose the potential of auditory binaural beat (BB) stimulation at an alpha frequency (10 Hz) for enhancing cognitive and neurological outcomes in AD patients.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients were divided into the experimental-Group (n = 15) and control-Group (n = 10). Psychometric and neurological assessments were conducted Pre-Treatment (Day 1) and Post-Treatment (Day 14) following consecutive days of binaural beats (BB) or auditory tone stimulation administered from Day 2 to Day 13.
RESULTS: A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of group (F = 6.087, p = 0.016) and session (F = 3.859, p = 0.024) on MMSE scores, with the experimental group showing significant improvement in MMSE scores (t = 7.33, p = 0.00000012) compared to the control group (p = 0.2306). Paired t-tests revealed a significant reduction in depression scores (DASS-21, t = 1.701, p = 0.0253) in the experimental group, while no significant improvements were noted in the control group. EEG recordings revealed significant changes in α-band, β-band, and γ-band power (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, The correlation between EEG bands and MMSE subparts showed that increased θ-band power in the experimental group was positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with the frontal region during language tasks and in the frontal and central regions during registration and orientation tasks, indicating potential neurocognitive benefits.
DISCUSSION: The results of this research imply that BB stimulation has untapped potential as a non-invasive therapy for patients with AD, hence there is the need for further studies to manage the dementia epidemic.",Front Aging Neurosci

Our objective was to use longitudinal Medicaid and Medicare data to describe the epidemiology of ADRD in publicly insured autistic adults. We used all claims and encounters from 2011 to 2019 to identify autism and ADRD. We calculated prevalence, incidence, age at onset, and created survival curves. There were 90,229 autistic adults ≥ 30 years of age and enrolled for at least 1 year in Medicaid and/or Medicare and 267 ADRD cases. Prevalence of ADRD was 2.09% (95% CI: 1.99%, 2.20%) in 2011 and 8.11% (95% CI: 7.92%, 8.30%) in 2019. Mean age at ADRD onset was 59.3 years (SD: 14.2). Mean age among men was 58.3 years (SD: 13.8) and 61.0 years among females. Incidence of ADRD was higher in autistic adults with intellectual disability with no difference by sex.

40128515,GALM Alleviates Aβ Pathology and Cognitive Deficit Through Increasing ADAM10 Maturation in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, causing dementia and affecting millions of individuals. One prominent characteristic in the brains of AD patients is glucose hypometabolism. In the context of galactose metabolism, intracellular glucose levels are heightened. Galactose mutarotase (GALM) plays a crucial role in maintaining normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of β-D-galactose into α-D-galactose (α-D-G). The latter is then converted into glucose-6-phosphate, improving glucose metabolism levels. However, the involvement of GALM in AD progression is still unclear. In the present study, we found that the expression of GALM was significantly increased in AD patients and model mice. Genetic knockdown of GALM using adeno-associated virus did not change the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP-cleaving enzymes including a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1). Interestingly, genetic overexpression of GALM reduced APP and Aβ deposition by increasing the maturation of ADAM10, although it did not alter the expression of BACE1 and PS1. Further electrophysiological and behavioral experiments showed that GALM overexpression significantly ameliorated the deficits in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice. Importantly, direct α-D-G (20 mg/kg, i.p.) also inhibited Aβ deposition by increasing the maturation of ADAM10, thereby improving hippocampal CA1 LTP and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice. Taken together, our results indicate that GALM shifts APP processing towards α-cleavage, preventing Aβ generation by increasing the level of mature ADAM10. These findings indicate that GALM may be a potential therapeutic target for AD, and α-D-G has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of AD.",Neurosci Bull
40152071,A review on benzoselenazoles: synthetic methodologies and potential biological applications.,"Among the various heterocyclic organoselenium compounds, a new class of benzoselenazoles has received great attention due to their chemical properties and biological applications. The ever-growing interest in the five-membered benzoselenazole heterocycles amongst chemists has made commendable impact. These heterocycles are a prominent class of organic molecules that have emerged as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the complex chemical properties of these heterocycles. Moreover, they have garnered significant importance in a wide range of biological applications. However, despite their biological activities, research on benzoselenazoles remains relatively limited, emphasising the need for further exploration in this area. Hence, considering the importance of benzoselenazoles, this comprehensive review compiles various synthetic procedures, highlighting the recent advances in their synthesis that have been disclosed in the literature. This review would offer chemists an array of information that will assist them in the development of more affordable and effective synthesis processes for benzoselenazoles. Therefore, it is believed that this review would provide relevant context on these achievements and will inspire synthetic organic chemists to use these effective technologies of such heterocycles for the future treatment of diseases caused by oxidative stress. The biological and pharmacological properties of these organoselenium heterocycles, which include their antioxidant, antitumor, and antibacterial activities and their application in Alzheimer's disease treatment and as pancreatic lipase inhibitors, are thoroughly summarized.

40082066,Effects of Dexamethasone and Tacrolimus on Mesenchymal Stem Cell Characteristics and Gene Expression.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are frequently used for therapeutic applications in both pre-clinical and clinical settings owing to their capacity for immune modulation and neuroprotective effects. However, transient fever is commonly observed as an adverse event following MSC injection in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the potential impact of immunosuppressants such as dexamethasone and tacrolimus on altering the characteristics of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Additionally, we examined whether these immunosuppressants affect the persistence of hMSCs or the immune response upon their administration into the brain parenchyma of AD mice. The exposure of hMSCs to high concentrations of dexamethasone and tacrolimus in vitro did not significantly alter the characteristics of hMSCs. The expression of genes related to innate immune responses, such as Irak1, Irf3, Nod1, and Ifnar1, was significantly downregulated by the additional administration of dexamethasone and tacrolimus to the brain parenchyma of AD mice. However, hMSC persistence in the AD mouse brain was not affected. The results of this study support the use of immunosuppressants to mitigate fever during stem cell therapy in patients with AD.",Int J Stem Cells
40095493,Pharmacological Evaluation of Aescin for Neuroprotection in Intracerebroventricular Streptozotocin Model of Alzheimer's Disease in Experimental Rats.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that results in the loss of memory and cognitive functions linked to redox disbalance, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters changes, and the accumulation of amyloid-beta (1-42) plaques in AD. In this study, rats were administered with intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) to produce AD-like symptoms in rats. ICV-STZ bilaterally, 3 mg/kg, was infused on days 1 and 3 with the help of Hamilton syringe by fixing cannula at the target position of rat brain using coordinates -2 mm (anteriposterior), 1.6 mm Mediolateral (ML), and 1.5 mm (dorsoventral). Learning and spatial memory were checked using Morris water maze and elevated plus maze apparatus. In ICV-STZ, rats lost their spatial and learning memory, increased level of prooxidant like Lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitrite and reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) level. The increased level acetylcholinesterase (AChE) catalyzed acetylcholine (ACh) concentration indicates cholinergic neuron degeneration. Furthermore, we found raised inflammatory markers and altered neurotransmitters level after ICV-STZ. Administration of aescin (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently ameliorated the behavioral alteration and inhibited inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β. Furthermore, aescin restored antioxidants like GSH, SOD, and catalase and reduced the nitrite and lipid peroxidation level. AChE enzyme causes degradation of ACh, and its level was declined after treatment with aescin. Aescin also restored GABA, norepinephrine, and serotonin level in the brain with prevention of raised glutamate level. Moreover, the histopathological study confirmed neuronal pathogenesis, and aescin significantly achieved neuroprotective effect via preventing neuroinflammation, balancing redox potential, and inhibiting AChE enzyme.",Assay Drug Dev Technol

40044956,Unlocking the Therapeutic Potential of the Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A Inhibitors in Alzheimer's Diseases.,"With 60-70% of all occurrences of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), an advancing neurological illness, is one of the most frequent causes of dementia. Even though the exact etiology of AD is still unidentified, persons who have the disease have been found to have a number of abnormalities in their brains. Apart from the buildup of amyloid-β plaques inside the brain tissue, it has been demonstrated that abnormal tau protein phosphorylation increases the risk of neuronal death. The discovery of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is becoming increasingly significant in the fight to create efficacious Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies. The pathophysiology of AD, which includes the creation of amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation, is intimately connected with the dysregulation of DYRK1A, which is essential for neurodevelopment and cognitive function. In addition to amyloid plaques, DYRK1A phosphorylates tau on 11 distinct Ser/Thr residues, forming aggregates known as ""neurofibrillary tangles"" that may be the cause of dementia, neuronal degeneration, and cell death. Therefore, targeting DYRK1A with small molecules may be a promising therapy strategy for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative illnesses. This study examines the therapeutic potential of DYRK1A inhibitors in AD and offers a thorough explanation of the molecular pathways through which DYRK1A promotes the development of the illness.",Mol Neurobiol
40155156,Design of Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions functionalized magnetic black phosphorus nanosheets for highly efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides.,"BACKGROUND: The abnormal variation of phosphorylation can lead to many human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Because of its high throughput and rapidity, mass spectrometry (MS)-based method has been widely used to characterize phosphopeptides/phosphoproteins in complex biological samples. However, the direct MS analysis for phosphopeptides is still a challenging task due to the complexity of biological samples and the signal suppression of abundant non-phosphopeptides. Therefore, an efficient enrichment platform for low-abundance phosphopeptide capture and detection is in great demand.
RESULTS: In this study, Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions functionalized magnetic black phosphorus nanosheets were successfully synthesized and characterized. The prepared magnetic material had high surface area (185.80 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), good hydrophilicity (12.15°), and magnetic property (33.38 emu g<sup>-1</sup>). The magnetic material provided abundant affinity sites for phosphopeptide enrichment through immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). By combining MS analysis, the method exhibited satisfactory performance, including high sensitivity (0.1 fmol), good selectivity (α-casein: β-casein: BSA = 1: 1: 5000), and high recovery (87.2 %). The method was applied to enrich and detect phosphopeptides in skimmed milk, human saliva, serum, and A549 cell lysate, proving its feasibility for phosphopeptide analysis. Additionally, the method provided the sequence motifs of the captured phosphopeptides and the biological functions of the phosphoproteins in A549 cell lysate.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work presented a facile analysis platform for phosphopeptides, including sample preparation, enrichment process, and MS detection. The analysis strategy was successfully adopted for capturing and analyzing phosphopeptides from stranded proteins and complex bio-samples. This work presents a novel approach for the design and construction of black phosphorus-based adsorbents in phosphoproteomics research.",Anal Chim Acta
40077790,Exploring the Efficacy and Safety of Nutritional Supplements in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the major challenges of modern medicine, with a growing impact on public health and healthcare systems. In recent years, dietary supplements use has been the subject of increasing interest as a complementary strategy for the prevention and treatment of the disease. Materials and Methods: A Review of reviews was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and REAPPRAISED checklist to evaluate the efficacy and safety of supplement use in AD. The search, performed across major scientific databases, identified 54 relevant articles, including 53 reviews and one mini-review, after applying specific inclusion criteria and removing duplicates. Results: The growing body of evidence suggests that some supplements may help reduce cognitive decline, inflammation, and target mechanisms behind AD. However, many of these supplements are still under investigation, with mixed results highlighting the need for high-quality research. A key challenge is the lack of data on optimal dosages, administration duration, and long-term safety, which limits clinical guidelines. Some studies have reported positive effects from specific regimens, such as curcumin (800 mg/day), omega-3 fatty acids (2 g/day), and resveratrol (600 mg/day). Other supplements, like phosphatidylserine (300 mg/day), multinutrient formulations, probiotics, vitamin E (2000 IU/day), and melatonin (3-10 mg/day), also show benefits, though study variability makes conclusions uncertain. Conclusions: While certain supplements show potential in mitigating cognitive decline in AD, inconsistent findings and gaps in dosage and safety data highlight the need for rigorous, large-scale trials. Future research should focus on personalized, multimodal strategies integrating targeted supplementation, dietary patterns, and microbiota-gut-brain interactions for enhanced neuroprotection.",Nutrients
40034518,Machine learning uncovers novel sex-specific dementia biomarkers linked to autism and eye diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted significant interest as predictive biomarkers for various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Machine learning (ML) methods enable the integration of miRNAs into highly accurate predictive models of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential expression of miRNAs across dementia subtypes compared to normal controls (NC) and analyze their enriched biological and disease pathways. Additionally, to evaluate the use of these miRNAs in binary and multiclass ML models for dementia prediction in both overall and sex-specific datasets.
METHODS: Using data comprising 1685 Japanese individuals (GSE120584 and GSE167559), we performed differential expression analysis to identify miRNAs associated with five dementia groups in both overall and sex-specific datasets. Pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to further analyze these miRNAs. ML classifiers were used to create predictive models of dementia.
RESULTS: We identified novel differentially expressed miRNA biomarkers distinguishing NC from five dementia subtypes. Incorporating these miRNAs into ML classifiers resulted in up to a 27% improvement in dementia risk prediction. Pathway analysis highlighted neuronal and eye disease pathways associated with dementia risk. Sex-specific analyses revealed unique biomarkers for males and females, with miR-128-1-5 as a protective factor for males in AD, VaD, and DLB, and miR-4488 as a risk factor for female AD, highlighting distinct pathways and potential therapeutic targets for each sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support existing dementia etiology research and introduce new potential and sex-specific miRNA biomarkers.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40009021,Astrocyte-Specific Phenotyping of FAD<sup>4T</sup> as an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory decline and behavioral changes. Its pathological features include senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive gliosis, comprising abnormal accumulations of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein surrounded by reactive astrocytes and microglia. Recently, it has emerged that severe reactive astrocytes and MAOB-dependent production of GABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are the real causes of learning and memory impairment and neurodegeneration. Diverse mouse models for AD have been developed to clarify pathological mechanisms and discover therapeutic strategies and drugs. However, there are many shortfalls and discrepancies among them. A new AD mouse model named FAD<sup>4T</sup> has been developed to overcome various shortcomings. Here, we employed astrocyte-focused screening procedures to examine the pathological features of FAD<sup>4T</sup> as an AD model. Our results revealed that the FAD<sup>4T</sup> mice showed abnormal accumulation of Aβ plaques in overall brain regions at 6 and 12 months. We found astrocytic hypertrophy with a significant elevation of GFAP and LCN2. However, the expressions of MAOB and iNOS, a severe reactive astrocyte marker, were unchanged. Electrophysiological and behavioral analysis indicated aberrant tonic GABA release, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired CA1-specific memory. These findings demonstrate that FAD<sup>4T</sup> mice mimic pathological and functional features of AD, different from other AD mouse models. These findings demonstrate that FAD<sup>4T</sup> mimics some features of AD patients but lacks other important features, such as severe reactive astrocytes and neurodegeneration. This astrocyte-focused screening method offers valuable tools for advancing AD research and developing new therapeutic strategies.",Glia
40160744,"Synthesis, Formation Mechanisms, and Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Novel Benzothiazole and Benzo[1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one as Potential Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors.","A novel series of benzothiazole derivatives was synthesized using straightforward and easily implementable procedures, achieving a high yield. Among these synthesized compounds, amino acids containing the benzothiazole moiety were successfully produced through an 8-step process, with yields reaching as high as 95%. Notably, a serendipitous compound containing both benzothiazole and benzo[1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one moieties was also synthesized using the same protocol, bypassing purification at step 7 and proceeding directly to hydrolysis. This highlights the unique role of the coupling reagent HATU (hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyluronium) in the reaction, as it facilitated high yields, reaching up to 90%. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed through spectral analysis. Density functional theory calculations suggested that energy barriers can be overcome by utilizing the energy from an exothermic reaction, enabling the thermodynamically favorable formation of this novel structure. Compounds 6d and 6f demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 32.00 and 25.33 μg/mL, respectively. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics analyses indicate that compounds 6d and 6f hold potential for combating Alzheimer's disease, due to their interactions with critical amino acid residues and structural stability.",ACS Omega
40057942,Temporal Changes in Alzheimer's Disease-Related Biomarkers in the CSF of Cognitively Normal Subjects at Different Ages: The Chongqing Ageing and Dementia Study.,"Revealing the temporal evolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers during aging is critical to understanding disease pathogenesis and developing early diagnoses and interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD). CSF was obtained from 549 cognitively normal subjects between 18 and 93 years of age. 12 AD-related biomarkers were evaluated, including amyloid β (Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau), neuronal injury/degeneration (T-tau, NFL, NSE, H-FABP, VILIP-1), neuroinflammation biomarkers (YKL-40, TREM2), and α-synuclein (α-synuclein). Associations between these biomarkers and age as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status were evaluated, and the associations among biomarkers were assessed. CSF Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau levels exhibited nonlinear associations with age, among which Aβ42 was significantly modulated by APOE ε4 status. Specifically, an accelerated decline in Aβ42 levels occurred at 45.69 years of age in the APOE ε4+ group, which was almost 23 years earlier than that in the APOE ε4- group (68.02 years). The age-related change pattern of CSF P-tau is similar to that of T-tau, with both increasing slightly with age but showing an accelerated change at ≈60 years of age in the APOE ε4+ group. All the other biomarkers except for α-synuclein were linearly associated with age, and APOE ε4 status had no effect on these associations. Most biomarkers were positively correlated with each other except for Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The evolution of AD-related biomarkers in CSF varies throughout the adult lifespan, with the APOE ε4 allele modifying the temporal changes in CSF Aβ42 levels, as well as potentially influencing P-tau and T-tau levels.",Aging Cell
40149790,Brain Ischemia in Alzheimer's Disease May Partly Counteract the Disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"BACKGROUND: In normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) there is blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which should increase the CSF formation rate (CSF<sub>fr)</sub> and, therefore, also increase the intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the ICP is normal in NPH. A lumped parameter study was performed to look at the interrelation between the ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the degree of BBB disruption in NPH. The model suggested that the CSF<sub>fr</sub> could be reduced in this condition if the BBB disruption was moderated by a reduction in the capillary transmural pressure (TMP) secondary to arteriolar constriction and a reduced CBF. In early Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is BBB disruption, reduced ICP, and global ischemia. This raises the possibility that the same physiology may occur in AD as occurs in NPH.
METHODS: A lumped parameter model previously used to describe the hydrodynamics of NPH was modified to investigate the effects of changes in CSF pressure and blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
RESULTS: The model indicates that the average capillary TMP is normal in MCI, but decreases as AD progresses. Removing CSF in AD patients during a tap test initially increases the capillary TMP. The brain in AD responds to a tap test by increasing its level of ischemia, and this reduces the capillary TMP.
CONCLUSIONS: A hypothesis is put forward that the BBB disruption in AD is partially mitigated by the brain making itself ischemic. Modelling gives support to this hypothesis. The model can suggest a cause for the development of ischemic neuronal loss and amyloid accumulation secondary to glymphatic flow disruption as AD progresses.",Brain Sci
40103703,Cordycepin mediates neuroprotection against apoptosis via ERK/CREB signaling activation in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neuronal cell models.,"The aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides has been associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by causing neurotoxicity due to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Cordycepin is a natural derivative of the nucleoside adenosine that displays potent antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. However, the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of cordycepin toward Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, as well as underlying mechanisms, is still unclear. In this study, we found that cordycepin conferred neuroprotection to catecholaminergic PC12 neuronal cell cultures exposed to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-insult by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species, restoring the mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibiting apoptosis. Cordycepin stimulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of the ERK pathway reduced the neuroprotective effect of cordycepin. Similar results were obtained with hippocampal HT22 neuronal cell cultures. Cumulatively, these findings suggest that cordycepin-induced neuroprotection toward Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxic insult may involve activation of the ERK/CREB pathway. This study expands our knowledge of the neuroprotective function of cordycepin and suggests that it holds promise as a natural lead compound for drug development in AD.",Ibrain
40144496,Inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway via an endogenous copper ion-responsive covalent organic framework nanozyme for Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Inhibition of cGAS-STING overactivation has recently emerged as a promising strategy to counteract Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current cGAS-STING inhibitors as immunosuppressants suffer from instability, non-specific targeting, and innate immune disruption. Here, an endogenous AD brain copper ion-responsive covalent organic framework (COF)-based nanozyme (denoted as TP@PB-COF@NADH) has been designed for targeted inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway for AD treatment. The effective trapping of excess brain endogenous copper ions by TP@PB-COF@NADH not only inhibits the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which is one of the mediators of cGAS-STING activation, but also activates the nanozyme activity of TP@PB-COF@NADH. Furthermore, the well-prepared nanozyme catalytically generates NAD<sup>+</sup> and consumes hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) through second near-infrared (NIR-II) enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) peroxidase (NPX)-like activity, realizing the efficient inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway and associated neuroinflammation. Moreover, replenishing NAD<sup>+</sup> levels efficiently restores mitochondrial function and ATP supply. In vivo studies demonstrate that TP@PB-COF@NADH with NIR-II irradiation significantly improves cognitive function in 3× Tg-AD mice, with a reduction in amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Collectively, this work presents a promising approach for AD treatment by using an AD brain harmful excess endogenous copper ion-responsive and efficient nanozyme.",Chem Sci
40018516,Investigation of protective effects of olanzapine on impaired learning and memory using behavioral tests in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, antioxidants may mitigate neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Aβ) and potentially reduce cell death. Previous research has demonstrated that olanzapine (OLZ) possesses antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated the protective and therapeutic effects of OLZ on an animal model of AD induced by Aβ using behavioral assessments.
METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups (n = 10 rats per group): a control group, a sham group that received an intracerebrovascular (ICV) injection of phosphate-buffered saline (the solvent for Aβ), an AD group that received an ICV injection of Aβ, an OLZ group that received OLZ via gavage for two months, and an AD + OLZ group that received OLZ for one month before and one month after AD induction.
RESULTS: We used the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT), Barnes Maze (BM), Passive Avoidance Test (PAT), and Morris Water Maze (MWM) to assess behavioral performance in the experimental rats. Aβ administration impaired cognition and increased anxiety-like behavior. Treatment with OLZ improved cognitive decline and reduced anxiety-like behavior in Aβ-infused rats.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that OLZ can restore cognitive performance and alleviate anxiety-like behavior following Aβ injection. Thus, OLZ may have both preventive and therapeutic potential for AD and could be considered a viable pharmacological option.",Front Aging Neurosci
40070544,"Advancing personalized digital therapeutics: integrating music therapy, brainwave entrainment methods, and AI-driven biofeedback.","Mental health disorders and cognitive decline are pressing global concerns, increasing the demand for non-pharmacological interventions targeting emotional dysregulation, memory deficits, and neural dysfunction. This review systematically examines three promising methodologies-music therapy, brainwave entrainment (binaural beats, isochronic tones, multisensory stimulation), and their integration into a unified therapeutic paradigm. Emerging evidence indicates that music therapy modulates affect, reduces stress, and enhances cognition by engaging limbic, prefrontal, and reward circuits. Brainwave entrainment, particularly within the gamma frequency range (30-100 Hz), facilitates neural oscillatory patterns linked to relaxation, concentration, and memory, with 40 Hz showing promise for cognitive enhancement, albeit with individual variability. Synchronized multisensory stimulation, combining auditory and visual inputs at gamma frequencies, has demonstrated potential in enhancing memory and supporting neural integrity, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. However, challenges such as patient response variability, lack of standardization, and scalability hinder widespread implementation. Recent research suggests that a synergistic application of these modalities may optimize therapeutic outcomes by leveraging complementary mechanisms. To actualize this, AI-driven biofeedback, enabling real-time physiological assessment and individualized adjustments-such as tailoring musical complexity, entrainment frequencies, and multisensory components-emerges as a promising solution. This adaptive model enhances treatment accessibility and consistency while maximizing long-term efficacy. Although in early stages, preliminary evidence highlights its transformative potential in reshaping non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Advancing this field requires interdisciplinary research, rigorous evaluation, and ethical data stewardship to develop innovative, patient-centered solutions for mental health and cognitive rehabilitation.",Front Digit Health
40129402,Validating a brief performance-based measure of cognition and daily functioning in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundThe Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale is widely used as a cognitive and functional measure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. Given its time and personnel burden, there is a need to more efficiently identify patients who warrant further evaluation or clinical trial qualification. To potentially address this need, a novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning has been developed for use in AD research and clinical care.ObjectiveTo test whether this novel performance-based test is associated with levels of daily functioning in both impaired and unimpaired individuals.MethodsOne-hundred-seventy-one participants (72 cognitively unimpaired; 53 amnestic mild cognitive impairment; 46 mild AD) completed the novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning, as well as the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) for estimating global CDR.ResultsThe novel test was significantly associated with the QDRS Total, as well as the Behavioral and Cognitive subdomains, and differentiated between estimated global CDR scores of 0 versus ≥0.5. No significant effect of age, sex, or education on the performance-based test was observed.ConclusionsThe performance-based test used in this study can be considered a measure of cognition and daily functioning. As such, it may be a quick, objective method for identifying impaired individuals who may qualify for clinical trial enrollment or may warrant further evaluation without the need for informant input.",J Alzheimers Dis
40159070,[Expression and clinical significance of CXCR3 on effector T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease].,"Objective: This study investigated the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) on CD45RO⁺ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its association with clinical features. Methods: A total of 41 AD patients and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from the Department of Neurology at the Medical Division of PLA General Hospital between September 2022 and March 2024. Flow cytometry was used to quantify CXCR3 expression on CD45RO⁺ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Dementia severity in AD patients was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Spearman correlation analysis examined the relationship between CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cell levels and cognitive function in the AD group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the predictive utility of CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cells for AD, quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). Results: Compared to healthy controls, AD patients exhibited significantly elevated levels of CD8⁺CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cells [17.8% (7.2%, 40.3%) vs. 8.2% (5.1%, 12.3%), Z=-2.59, P&lt;0.05]. However, no significant differences were observed for CD4⁺CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cells, CD4⁺CD45RO⁻CXCR3⁺ T cells, or CD8⁺CD45RO⁻CXCR3⁺ T cells (P&gt;0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between CD8⁺CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cell levels and cognitive scores (MMSE: r=-0.72, P&lt;0.05; MoCA: r=-0.70, P&lt;0.05). ROC analysis demonstrated an AUC of 0.81 for CD8⁺CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cells in predicting AD, with a sensitivity of 59.0% and specificity of 93.3%. Conclusions: CXCR3 expression is significantly upregulated on CD8⁺CD45RO⁺ T cells in AD patients, and its levels correlate with cognitive impairment severity. These findings suggest that CD8⁺CD45RO⁺CXCR3⁺ T cells may serve as a potential biomarker for AD diagnosis and progression monitoring.",Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi
40067298,Sex Differences in Apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer Disease Pathology Across Ancestries.,"IMPORTANCE: Age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are the strongest risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The role of APOE in AD varies with sex and ancestry. While the association of APOE with AD biomarkers also varies across sex and ancestry, no study has systematically investigated both sex-specific and ancestry differences of APOE on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together, resulting in limited insights and generalizability.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate the association of sex and APOE-ε4 with 3 core CSF biomarkers across ancestries.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examined 3 CSF biomarkers (amyloid β1-42 [Aβ42], phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau], and total tau, in participants from 20 cohorts from July 1, 1985, to March 31, 2020. These individuals were grouped into African, Asian, and European ancestries based on genetic data. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2023, to November 10, 2024.
EXPOSURE: Sex (male or female) and APOE-ε4.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The associations of sex and APOE-ε4 with biomarker levels were assessed within each ancestry group, adjusting for age. Meta-analyses were performed to identify these associations across ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to exclude the potential influence of the APOE-ε2 allele.
RESULTS: This cohort study included 4592 individuals (mean [SD] age, 70.8 [10.2] years; 2425 [52.8%] female; 119 [2.6%] African, 52 [1.1%] Asian, and 4421 [96.3%] European). Higher APOE-ε4 dosage scores were associated with lower Aβ42 values (β [SE], -0.58 [0.02], P < .001), indicating more severe pathology; these associations were seen in men and women separately and jointly. The association with APOE-ε4 was statistically greater in men (β [SE], -0.63 [0.03]; P < .001) vs women (β [SE], -0.52 [0.03]; P < .001) of European ancestry (P = .01 for interaction). Women had higher levels of p-tau, indicating more severe neurofibrillary pathology. The association between APOE-ε4 dosage and p-tau was in the expected direction (higher APOE-ε4 dosage for higher p-tau values) in both sexes, but the difference between sexes was significant only in those of African ancestry (β [SE], 0.10 [0.18]; P = .57 for men; β [SE], 0.66 [0.17]; P < .001 for women; P = .03 for interaction). Women also had higher levels of total tau, indicating more neuronal damage. The association between APOE-ε4 dosage and total tau was stronger in women than in men in the African cohort (β [SE], 0.20 [0.22]; P = .36 for men and β [SE], 0.65 [0.22], P = .004 for women [P = .16 for interaction]) and European cohort (β [SE], 0.36 [0.03]; P < .001 in women and β [SE], 0.27 [0.03], P < .001 in men [P = .053 for interaction]); no significant associations were found in the Asian cohort. Sensitivity analysis excluding APOE-ε2 carriers yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the association of the APOE-ε4 risk allele with tau accumulation was higher in women than in men. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex differences in APOE-ε4's association with AD biomarkers and tau pathology mechanisms in AD. Although this study provides robust evidence of complex interplay between sex and APOE-ε4 for European ancestry, further research is needed to fully understand other ancestry differences.",JAMA Netw Open
40136848,Critical Review of the Methodological Shortcoming of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cognitive Function Studies.,"Growing evidence suggests that abnormal diurnal blood pressure rhythms may be associated with many adverse health outcomes, including increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. This study evaluates methodological aspects of research on bidirectional associations between ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) patterns and cognitive function. By examining the 28 recent studies included in a recent systematic review on the association between ABPM patterns with cognitive function and risk of dementia, our review revealed several significant limitations in study design, sample characteristics, ABPM protocol, cognitive assessment, and data analysis. The major concerns include a lack of diversity in study populations with underrepresentation of Blacks and Latinos, a predominant focus on Alzheimer's disease or all-cause dementia without distinguishing other dementia subtypes, different and not standardized measures of cognition or dementia, prevalent use of 24 h monitoring without considering the adaption effect, inconsistent definitions of dipping status, and ignorance of individual differences in timings of daily activities such as bed and awakening times. In addition, confounding variables such as class, dose, and timing of antihypertensive medication are inadequately controlled or considered. Further, longitudinal studies were scarce examining the bidirectional relationship between ABPM patterns and cognitive decline over time. Collectively, these deficiencies undermine the reliability and generalizability of current findings. Addressing these methodological challenges is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of diurnal blood pressure rhythms in diverse populations and for developing an evidence-based guideline for ambulatory monitoring and control of blood pressure across the sleep-wake cycle to prevent cognitive decline and dementia.",Clocks Sleep

We observed slight hyperintensity of the left PC&amp;A in older adults and probable AD (pAD) patients on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2W-FLAIR) images.PurposeTo quantitatively assess the validity of the left PC&amp;A hyperintensity in older adults and pAD patients.Material and MethodsT2W-FLAIR images from three groups were retrospectively evaluated: (i) younger control (YC; n = 77): individuals aged 37.9 ± 8.4 years; (ii) older control (OC; n = 98): individuals aged 76.9 ± 5.3 years without cognitive impairment; and (iii) pAD (n = 35): individuals aged 80.5 ± 6.9 years with pAD. Signal intensity (SI) ratios of the left to right PC&amp;A (L-PC&amp;A/R-PC&amp;A) were calculated for all groups. In the OC and pAD groups, SI ratios of the left PC&amp;A to pons (L-PC&amp;A/P) and the right PC&amp;A to pons (R-PC&amp;A/P) were calculated. The regions of interest were defined as large as possible on transaxial images in which the PC&amp;As were most broadly depicted.ResultsThe mean L-PC&amp;A/R-PC&amp;A in the YC, OC, and pAD groups showed an increasing trend in that sequence (P &lt; 0.001). The mean L-PC&amp;A/P was higher in the pAD group than in the OC group (P &lt; 0.001). However, the mean R-PC&amp;A/P was not significantly different between the OC and pAD groups (P = 0.245).ConclusionThe SI of the left PC&amp;A on T2W-FLAIR images significantly increased with age and in individuals with pAD, likely reflecting the deterioration of the left PC&amp;A.",Acta Radiol
39975469,The Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA): A novel measure of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders health literacy in diverse populations.,"INTRODUCTION: Low health literacy about Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may limit help-seeking, early detection, and enrollment in clinical trials, particularly in minoritized communities. We created the Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA) to improve ADRD health literacy.
METHODS: The DeLA, a storytelling method that included culturally adaptable vignettes embedded with important factoids about ADRD, was administered to 213 participants from urban and rural regions of Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida and 193 participants in American Samoa.
RESULTS: The DeLA increased dementia health literacy and performed well across different participant characteristics (age, sex, education, geographic locale, race, ethnicity, and cognitive performance). Gains in ADRD health literacy were associated with older age, more education, better socioeconomic status, greater resilience, and better cognitive performance.
DISCUSSION: Increasing ADRD health literacy could increase health-seeking behaviors in diverse populations for treatment, enrich recruitment into clinical trials, and may help reduce disparities in health outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Low health literacy about Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) may limit help-seeking, early detection, and enrollment in clinical trials, particularly in minoritized communities.The Dementia Literacy Assessment (DeLA), a storytelling method that included culturally adaptable vignettes embedded with important factoids about ADRD, was administered to 406 participants from urban and rural regions of Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida and American Samoa (11.8% White, 39.8% Black or African American, and 48.4% Pacific Islander [predominantly Samoan] individuals).The DeLA increased dementia health literacy and performed well across different participant characteristics (age, sex, education, geographic locale, race, and cognitive performance).Gains in ADRD health literacy were associated with older age, more education, better socioeconomic status, greater resilience, and better cognitive performance.Increasing ADRD health literacy could increase health-seeking behaviors in diverse populations for treatment, enrich recruitment into clinical trials, and help reduce disparities in health outcomes.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y)
40122810,Enhancing TREM2 expression activates microglia and modestly mitigates tau pathology and neurodegeneration.,"TREM2, a microglia-specific receptor, is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, mediating microglial responses to amyloid pathology critical to AD development. However, its role in tau pathology and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Using the PS19 tauopathy mouse model with inducible overexpression of human wild-type TREM2 (TREM2-WT) or the R47H variant (TREM2-R47H), we show that increasing TREM2-WT expression modestly reduces soluble phosphorylated tau levels and mildly preserves neuronal integrity. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that TREM2-WT robustly enhances microglial activation, characterized by a disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature. In contrast, TREM2-R47H overexpression exhibits a loss-of-function phenotype, with no significant impact on tau levels, neurodegeneration, or microglial activation. These findings highlight the role of TREM2 in modulating microglial activity and its influence on tau pathology and neurodegeneration, providing important insights for the future development of therapies targeting TREM2 or microglial pathways in AD or other tauopathies.",J Neuroinflammation
40108007,Modulation of the cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease by valproic acid: possible drug repurposing.,"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system. Its main two hallmarks are extracellular deposition of aggregated amyloid beta resulting in senile plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins forming neuro-fibrillary tangles. As those processes are promoted by the glycogen synthase kinase-3 enzyme, GSK3 inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in SAD. GSK3 is also inhibited by the action of insulin on insulin signaling. Insulin receptor desensitization in the brain is hypothesized to cause inhibition of insulin signaling pathway that ultimately causes cognitive deficits seen in SAD. In extant research, induction of cognitive impairment is achieved by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin-a diabetogenic compound that causes desensitization to insulin receptors in the brain leading to the appearance of most of the SAD signs and symptoms. Valproic acid -a histone deacetylase inhibitor and anti-epileptic drug-has been recently studied in the management of SAD as a possible GSK3 inhibitor. Accordingly, the aim of the present study is to explore the role of multiple VPA doses on the downstream effects of the insulin signaling pathway in ICV STZ-injected mice and suggest a possible mechanism of VPA action.

40112745,Factors affecting the physical stability of peptide self-assembly in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Biological systems comprise of diverse biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. Peptides, which are short chains of amino acids, exhibit unique properties when assembled to nano-level architectures. Self-assembling peptides possess a remarkable ability to organize into structured aggregates such as nanofibers, nanotubes, nanoribbons, and nanovesicles. These intricate structures are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Prion disease, Huntington's disease, and type II diabetes. Peptide nano assembly can be guided by external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, ultrasound, electric and magnetic fields. In this review, the discussion will be centred around the various factors that influence the self-assembly of peptides alongside therapeutic interventions that align with the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and kinetics to modulate the aggregation characteristics of peptide self-assembly.",Neuropeptides
40099706,"Pharmacokinetics, Tissue Distribution, and Excretion of 9-Methylfascaplysin, a Potential Anti-Alzheimer's Disease Agent.","9-Methylfascaplysin, a derivative of the marine natural product fascaplysin, has shown promising anti- Alzheimer's disease (AD) potential through its anti-β-amyloid (Aβ) neuroprotective effects. However, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 9-methylfascaplysin, crucial for its preclinical evaluation, have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we developed and validated a sensitive and accurate ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of 9-methylfascaplysin in rat plasma. The method demonstrated a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 1 ng/mL and a linear quantification range of 5-2000 ng/mL. The PK study in rat plasma was conducted. After intragastric administration, the plasma concentration of 9-methylfascaplysin peaked at a maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of 193.4 ng/m and an enterohepatic circulation (EHC) phenomenon was observed. By comparing the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values obtained from intragastric and intravenous administrations, the absolute oral bioavailability (F) of 9-methylfascaplysin was determined as 18.3%. The tissue distribution study revealed that following a single intragastric administration, 9-methylfascaplysin was most concentrated in the stomach, followed by the small intestine, large intestine, liver, kidney, brain, lung, spleen, and heart in descending order. Furthermore, the excretion profiles of 9-methylfascaplysin in rat urine and feces were studied. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the PK behavior of 9-methylfascaplysin and serve as a foundation for its further preclinical evaluation and potential clinical application as an anti-AD agent.",Electrophoresis
40055834,A novel c.1468 G > A GRN mutation causes frontotemporal dementia in a Chinese Han family.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: GRN mutations act as causative factors in patients with FTD clinical phenotype or FTD pathology and exhibit high clinical heterogeneity. The discovery of these mutations and the analysis of their associations with resembling Alzheimer's disease should be critical to understand the pathogenesis of FTD.
METHODS: Clinical analysis, neuroimaging, target region capture and high-throughput sequencing were performed in a family of 3 generations. The underlying Alzheimer's pathology was evaluated by using biomarker evidence obtained from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid testing, 18F-florbetapir (AV-45) PET imaging and FDG18-positron emission tomography imaging.
RESULTS: Through target region capture and high-throughput sequencing, a three-generation family was able to identify a heterozygous G to A point mutation at position 490 (c.1468)G > A, which led to a valine to methionine substitution (V490M) at exon 12. This unique missense mutation was found at codon 1468. Eight members of the proband's family-two sisters and the proband himself-had the mutation found by Sanger sequencing. Interestingly, biomarker tests for amyloid in the proband's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicated pathology consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mutation was expected to have a high likelihood of being pathogenic.
CONCLUSIONS: We firstly reported a novel mutation in the GRN gene at codon 490 (V490M) in exon 12 in a China FTD family. The CSF biomarker alterations of the proband revealed a reduction in Aβ42 and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The analysis of mutation might support the role of GRN in patients with FTD and contribute to the discovery of a new pathological mechanism underlying the disease.",Eur J Med Res
40116691,"A statistical method for predicting amyloid-β deposits from severity, extend, and ratio indices of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT.","BackgroundAmyloid-β (Aβ) deposit prediction accuracy is necessary for clinicians treating patients desiring Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying drugs. Aβ-PET imaging is useful for diagnosis, but high in cost compared to brain perfusion SPECT. However, SPECT displays regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and does not detect Aβ deposits, therefore requiring additional clinical information.ObjectiveThis article describes a novel statistical method to predict amyloid deposits via PET images (Aβ+ or Aβ-) using the three indices of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT - severity, extend, and ratio - for the three ROIs.MethodsCandidate patients (N = 114 patients [55% male], 81 Aβ+ 33 Aβ-, mean age 74.2 ± 6.6 years, mean MMSE score 23.7 ± 2.8) underwent MRI and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT scanning. After examining SPECT index, demographic, and age data, age and sex were treated as confounders in one, two, and three-index logistic additive models with severity, extend, and ratio as explanatory variables. Area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were used as statistical indices for model fitness and accuracies. Three-hold cross validation analyses were conducted to evaluate error rates.ResultsAccording to ROC analysis, best scores for fitness and accuracy were obtained from the three-index model with patients' age and sex for the configured ROIs including precuneus, posterior cingulate and temporal-parietal region of SPECT (AUC: 0.818, Sensitivity: 0.803, Specificity: 0.727).ConclusionsThis technique using <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT data can predict amyloid deposits with acceptable accuracy.

40147612,Association between a healthy lifestyle and dementia in older adults with obesity: A prospective study in the UK biobank.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of adherence to low-risk lifestyle factors on dementia risk in individuals with obesity remains unclear. We aimed to explore the association between healthy lifestyles with dementia in obese participants.
METHODS: Dementia-free participants from the UK Biobank, aged 50 years or older with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at baseline were included. A weighted healthy lifestyle score was calculated incorporating both traditional and emerging lifestyle factors. The primary outcome was all-cause dementia and its subtypes (Alzheimer's disease and Vascular dementia). Cox regression models analyzed the association between healthy lifestyle scores and dementia risk. Restricted cubic splines tested the dose-response. We also examined the effect of lifestyle scores on dementia risk in individuals with normal weight and overweight.
RESULTS: A total of 54,365 participants were included at baseline. During a median follow-up of 14.4 years, 1271 participants developed all-cause dementia, including 537 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 343 cases of vascular dementia. A 20 % increase in the lifestyle score was associated with a 7 % reduction in dementia risk (HR: 0.93; 95 % CI: 0.91,0.96) and a 4 % reduction in Alzheimer's disease risk (HR: 0.96; 95 % CI: 0.92,1.00). The association was stronger in overweight and obese participants. No significant link was found for vascular dementia.
LIMITATIONS: Information on lifestyle behaviors was self-reported and might be prone to measurement error.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle may reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in older obese individuals, with a stronger effect observed in those with higher lifestyle scores.",J Affect Disord
40030298,Advancing Metaverse-Based Healthcare With Multimodal Neuroimaging Fusion Via Multi-Task Adversarial Variational Autoencoder for Brain Age Estimation.,"The metaverse, which integrates physical and virtual realities through technologies such as high-speed internet, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence (AI), offers transformative prospects across various fields, particularly healthcare. This integration introduces a new paradigm in AI-driven medical imaging, particularly in assessing brain age'a crucial marker for detecting age-related neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI (sMRI), incorporating functional MRI (fMRI) data presents significant challenges due to its complex data structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address these challenges, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (M-AVAE), a bespoke deep learning framework designed to enhance brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. The M-AVAE uniquely separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, effectively isolating shared and modality-specific features. Additionally, integrating multitask learning with sex classification as a supplementary task enables the model to account for sex-specific aging nuances. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset'a comprehensive multisite brain MRI aggregation-the M-AVAE demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, surpassing conventional methodologies. This success positions M-AVAE as a powerful tool for metaverse-based healthcare applications in brain age estimation.

40053161,A dose-response meta-analysis of physical activity and the risk of alzheimer's disease in prospective studies.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become an increasing global health challenge, particularly with the accelerated aging of the population. Therefore, preventive research targeting AD has become especially important. In recent years, physical activity (PA), as a potential non-pharmacological intervention, has garnered increasing attention from researchers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PA on AD risk through systematic review and meta-analysis and to further explore its potential preventive benefits.
METHODS: The literature search for this study encompassed PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering publications from their inception until November 1, 2024. Only English-language publications were included. Stratified analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between PA and AD risk by combining multivariate-adjusted effect estimates using random-effects models, along with subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, multifactorial meta-regression, and dose-response analyses to comprehensively assess the association between PA and the risk of AD.
RESULTS: Ultimately, 29 studies were included in the primary analysis, along with 3 additional studies for supplemental analyses, involving 1,453,561 participants, of whom 68,497 were diagnosed with AD. The results indicated that high-intensity PA significantly reduced the risk of AD by 26% (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.83). Additionally, dose-response analyses revealed both linear and nonlinear associations, with linear dose-response results indicating a 15% reduction in AD risk for every 10 MET-h/wk increase in PA. Subgroup analyses indicated that the protective effect of PA was more pronounced in the non-obese population (BMI < 25) (HR = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.52-0.82), in individuals aged 75 years or older (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.48-0.67), and in non-APOE ε4 gene carriers (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.93), who exhibited greater protection. To explore the sources of heterogeneity among the included studies, a multifactorial meta-regression analysis was performed, which did not significantly explain the heterogeneity of the primary outcomes. Moreover, the robustness of the pooled results was confirmed through supplemental meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the potential of PA in reducing the risk of AD, particularly in non-obese populations, older age groups, and non-APOE ε4 gene carriers. PA holds significant potential in public health as a feasible and low-cost non-pharmacological intervention strategy.",J Neurol
40034523,"Repurposing peripheral immunocytes of Bacillus Calmette Guerin-vaccinated melanoma patients to reveal preventive Alzheimer's disease mechanisms, possibly via the unfolded protein response.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dysfunctional unfolded protein response (UPR) is revealed by amyloid-β aggregates. Normally, UPR reacts to endoplasmic reticulum stress by resolving misfolded/aggregated proteins, and UPR failure induces brain-cell apoptosis consistent with AD pathology. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and immunocyte brain infiltrates are involved in AD pathogenesis, whose risk is lowered by the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Hypothetically, BCG prevents AD caused by UPR-driven apoptosis in PBMC brain infiltrates, corrected by BCG-vaccinated PBMC brain infiltrates.
OBJECTIVE: To reveal whether BCG shifts the UPR towards cell survival. Method: PBMC proteins from 6 individuals were compared by immuno-electrophoresis before and after BCG hypervaccination. Cryopreserved PBMC provided an opportunity to analyze the BCG impact on the UPR, although their donor destiny to develop AD was unknown. UPR signaling responsive to BCG was recorded to examine if BCG can influence UPR signaling and thereby explain the previously demonstrated AD prevention by BCG.
RESULTS: UPR signal levels were scored according to positive versus negative cell survival odds by the BCG impact on a dozen UPR signals. The balance between positive and negative scores of individuals emphasizes the impact of the BCG vaccine on the UPR. The antiapoptotic UPR signals under BCG show opposite trends to UPR signals in AD brains, reported by the literature. In conclusion, 3/6 individuals had superior PBMC survival chances under BCG.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the UPR is part of the mechanism responsible for reducing the risk of AD, as previously shown among BCG-treated bladder cancer patients.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40042504,Dynamic lifetime risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease with longitudinal cognitive assessment measurements.,"INTRODUCTION: The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the importance of predicting lifetime risk and updating assessments as new data emerge. This study aimed to develop a dynamic model using longitudinal cognitive assessments for updated risk predictions.
METHODS: This study used data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) to develop a dynamic risk prediction model based on five cognitive domains, updated annually over 10 years.
RESULTS: The lifetime prediction models based on 2384 participants showed improved area under the curve (AUC) over time, rising from 0.578 at baseline to 0.765 with 10 years of data. The models predicting AD onset before ages 85 and 90 showed superior performance, with AUCs increasing from 0.761 to 0.932 and 0.658 to 0.876, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Incorporating longitudinal cognitive assessments improves AD risk prediction as more data become available. Future research should integrate diverse data types to further boost predictive accuracy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Developed a dynamic lifetime risk prediction model. The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.578 at baseline to 0.765 with 10 years of data. The models predicting pre-85 and pre-90 risks demonstrated superior performance.",Alzheimers Dement
40043915,A nasally administrated reactive oxygen species-responsive carrier-free gene delivery nanosystem for Alzheimer's disease combination therapy.,"Combination therapies targeting multiple pathways are needed in order to improve treatment outcomes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its complex pathogenesis. Amyloid-β and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation significantly contribute to AD pathogenesis. Amyloid-β-related nucleic acid drugs have demonstrated considerable potential in AD treatment; however, their clinical translation is limited by complex synthesis processes and carrier toxicity. Herein, an intranasally administrated, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive, carrier-free gene delivery nanosystem (FTBR-NAC) was constructed for re-polarizing microglia and decreasing amyloid-β expression. In this nanosystem, fingolimod was conjugated with biguanide via an ROS-responsive linker to form the carrier for β-secretase 1 siRNA (siBACE1) to form FTBR nanoparticles. The electropositivity of FTBR and mucolytic activity of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) together enhanced the brain entry of FTBR. Upon reaching the brain, FTBR responded to the elevated ROS at the pathological site, releasing siBACE1 and fingolimod. Administration of FTBR-NAC improved cognitive function in AD mice, demonstrating the high therapeutic efficacy of this relatively simple nanosystem.",J Control Release
40134691,Efficacy of Ginkgo biloba as an adjunct to donepezil in amyloid PET-positive Alzheimer's patients.,"BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba is widely used in some regions as an adjunct therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its potential mechanisms include antioxidative and anti-amyloid properties, yet clinical evidence remains mixed.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether combining Ginkgo with donepezil confers additional benefits in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. We also explored changes in the plasma biomarker MDS-Oaβ (Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Aβ), which reflects the propensity of Aβ monomers to form oligomers.
METHODS: This retrospective study included newly diagnosed, drug-naïve AD patients who were amyloid PET-positive and had at least 12 months of follow-up. Participants received either donepezil alone (Donepezil-only) or donepezil plus Ginkgo (Donepezil-Ginkgo). Clinical measures included the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and the Sum of Boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB). Plasma MDS-Oaβ was assessed at baseline and at 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed (60 Donepezil-only, 41 Donepezil-Ginkgo). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar. After 12 months, the Donepezil-only group showed minimal change in K-MMSE and a slight decrease in MDS-Oaβ. The Donepezil-Ginkgo group demonstrated a significant improvement in K-MMSE (+2.4) and a larger reduction in MDS-Oaβ (-0.15). No significant between-group difference was observed for CDR-SB. Adverse events were mostly mild and did not lead to discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: The addition of Ginkgo to donepezil may yield superior cognitive outcomes and a greater decrease in plasma MDS-Oaβ compared with donepezil alone in amyloid PET-positive AD patients. Further large-scale, prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate Ginkgo's mechanistic role in AD.",Front Neurol
40103521,Monitoring Acidification Preceding Aβ Deposition in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Amyloid beta (Aβ) is the primary early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and since an acidic environment promotes Aβ aggregation, acidification plays a crucial role in AD progression. In this study, a novel acid-responsive near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe alongside multiple molecular biology techniques to investigate the temporal relationship between acidification and Aβ deposition, as well as the underlying mechanisms of acidification is employed. By monitoring 2- to 11-month-old APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) mice, it is detected significant fluorescence signal in APP/PS1 mice beginning at 3 months preceding Aβ deposition at 5 months, and peaking at 5 months, followed by cognitive deficits at 8 months. Additionally, elevated monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) protein expression in 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice indicated disruption of astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) homeostasis. Overall, this findings first demonstrate that acidification precedes Aβ deposition, peaks at the onset of Aβ deposition, and diminishes thereafter, with early acidification likely driven by the disruption of ANLS.",Adv Healthc Mater
40154898,Revealing the effective components and mechanism of Zhimu-Huangbai herb-pair in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Zhimu-Huangbai herb-pair (ZB) is one of the most widely accepted prescriptions for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the effective components and mechanism of ZB for treating AD have not been fully understood.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to reveal the active components of ZB in the treatment of AD through serum pharmacochemistry, identify the potential targets and pathways of ZB in treating AD through metabolomics, and subsequently verify its mechanism through in vivo experiments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The components of ZB in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid were determined by using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The efficacy of ZB was assessed in a mouse model of AD induced by D-galactose. Metabolomics methods were used for screening and identification of differential metabolites and enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the activities of enzyme complexes I-IV, as well as the levels of ATP and ROS in hippocampal mitochondria of mice. Additionally, the expression of key genes and proteins in the signaling pathway was examined by utilizing immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot.
RESULTS: A total of 27 prototype components were identified from the serum of rats given ZB, of which 8 components were simultaneously detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 20 different metabolites were identified from mouse plasma using a metabolomics technique. The enrichment analysis results revealed that the pathway of ZB treatment for AD mainly involves glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. In vivo experiments have shown that ZB can improve the energy metabolism of the brain and increase the production of ATP by improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, ZB could promote the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increase the density of postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), and enhance the expression of synaptophysin (SYN).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that ZB can improve mitochondrial and synaptic function in AD mice induced by D-gal, providing experimental support for the clinical application and drug development for the prevention and treatment of AD.",J Ethnopharmacol
40009384,Ultrasound Neuromodulation With Transcranial Pulse Stimulation in Alzheimer Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Given the increasing prevalence of dementia and the limited treatment options available, ultrasound neuromodulation could serve as a novel add-on therapy to standard treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD). As ultrasound neuromodulation is still in its early stages, further research is essential to fully explore its potential in treating brain disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and functional imaging effects of transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) in patients with AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted at the Medical University of Vienna between January 1, 2017, and July 27, 2022. Sixty patients with clinically diagnosed AD receiving state-of-the-art treatment were randomly allocated to treatment sequence groups verum-sham (first cycle verum, second cycle sham, n = 30) and sham-verum (n = 30). Data analysis was performed from July 28, 2022, to September 5, 2024.
INTERVENTION: Each participant received 6 verum and 6 sham TPS sessions (6000 pulses, 0.20 mJ/mm2, 5 Hz) to frontoparietal brain areas.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Neuropsychological tests, including the primary outcome Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) corrected total score (CTS), were performed at baseline and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following the stimulations in each cycle. Primary and secondary outcomes, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and Beck Depression Inventory-II, were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis and, for sensitivity, by per protocol analysis.
RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat analysis, 60 patients between ages 51 and 82 years (mean [SD], 70.65 [8.16] years; 30 females; 30 males) were included. The CERAD CTS increased by a mean (SD) of 2.22 (6.87) points in the verum condition from 70.93 (14.27) points at baseline to 73.15 (14.90) 3 months after stimulation, while the mean (SD) score in the sham condition increased by 1.00 (6.82) point vs baseline from 71.68 (13.62] at baseline to 72.68 (14.48) 3 months after stimulation. Primary data analysis of the condition × session interaction was not significant (P = .68; partial η2 [ηp2] = 0.01), but its interaction with age was P = .003; ηp2 = 0.08, followed by post hoc analyses of age subsamples. Although several patients older than 70 years benefited from verum TPS, only the younger subgroup (≤70 years) showed significantly higher CTS increases for verum in all poststimulation sessions (condition × session: P = .005; ηp2 = 0.16). At 3 months after stimulation, for example, a mean (SD) 3.91 (7.86)-point increase was found for verum TPS in the younger patients, but a mean (SD) CTS decrease of 1.83 (5.80) was observed for sham. Memory-associated brain activation was significantly higher after verum TPS in the precuneus, visual, and frontal areas, while resting state functional connectivity was significantly upregulated in the dorsal attention network. In the per protocol sample, a significant reduction of the Beck Depression Inventory-II scores 3 months following verum TPS was found (verum baseline: 7.27 [5.87]; verum 3 months after stimulation: 5.27 [5.27]; sham baseline: 6.70 [5.65]; sham 3 months after stimulation: 6.22 [4.40]; P = .008; ηp2 = 0.23). During both verum and sham conditions, the most common observed adverse symptom was depression; no major neuropathologic change was detected in the patients by detailed neuroradiologic assessments.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of TPS in patients with AD, a 2-week verum treatment improved cognitive scores in the younger subgroup, ameliorated depressive symptoms, and induced upregulation of functional brain activation and connectivity. These findings suggest TPS may be a safe and promising add-on therapy for patients with AD receiving state-of-the-art treatment.

There is an emerging consensus from epidemiological studies suggesting a potential inverse relationship between the two conditions; that is, the presence of one disease might offer some level of protection against the other. The etiology of both cancer and AD is intricately linked to dysregulation and perturbations in critical signaling pathways. These pathways, along with the diverse factors they encompass, exert distinct influences on the pathogenesis of two diseases.

40126287,Aging Gut-Brain Interactions: Pro-Inflammatory Gut Bacteria Are Elevated in Fecal Samples from Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Dementia.,"Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by an irreversible decline in cognitive function. The pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders has been linked to changes in the gut microbiota, transmitted through the gut-brain axis. Methods: We set out to establish by case-control study methodology whether there were any differences in the composition and/or function of the gut microbiota between older resident adults in care homes with or without an AD diagnosis via analysis of the microbial composition from fecal samples. Results: The microbial composition, determined by 16S rRNA gene profiling, indicated that AD sufferers had significantly increased proportions of Escherichia/Shigella and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and significantly decreased proportions of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Roseburia species. The increase in potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria was consistent with slightly higher concentrations of calprotectin, a biomarker of gut inflammation. Fecal concentrations of most microbial metabolites measured were similar across groups, although participants with AD had significantly increased proportions of the branched-chain fatty acid, iso-butyrate, and lower overall concentrations of total short chain fatty acids. Conclusions: Participants with Alzheimer's disease have several key differences within their gut microbiota profile, in contrast to care home residents without Alzheimer's disease. The altered microbiome included both compositional and functional changes linked to poorer health and gut inflammation.",Geriatrics (Basel)

METHODS: This review examines and summarizes relevant studies regarding the neuroimaging of the AD continuum, and comprehensively summarizes and outlines the SCD clinical features characterizing along with the corresponding neuroimaging changes involving structural, functional, and metabolic networks.
RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of SCD include a subjective decline in self-perceived cognitive function, and there are significant imaging changes, such as reductions in gray matter volume in certain brain regions, abnormalities in the integrity of white matter tracts and diffusion metrics, alterations in functional connectivity between different sub-networks or within networks, as well as abnormalities in brain metabolic networks and cerebral blood flow perfusion.
CONCLUSION: The 147 referenced studies in this paper indicate that exploring the structural, functional, and metabolic network changes in the brain related to SCD through neuroimaging aims to enhance the goals and mission of brain science development programs: ""Understanding the Brain,"" ""Protecting the Brain,"" and ""Creating the Brain,"" thereby strengthening researchers' investigation into the mechanisms of brain function.

However, no medications specifically targeting neuroinflammation are clinically available, and conventional anti-inflammatory drugs exhibit limited efficacy. Here, we identified cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) as a novel therapeutic target in neuroinflammation. Elevated CYP2E1 levels were observed in hippocampal tissues of mouse and rat neuroinflammation models, as well as in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. Genetic ablation of Cyp2e1 improved spatial learning and memory in neuroinflammatory rats and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in Cyp2e1-deficient microglia. Furthermore, Q11 (1-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl) ethenone), a novel CYP2E1 inhibitor developed and synthesized in our laboratory, effectively ameliorated Alzheimer's disease-related spatial learning and memory functions and depression-related anxiety-like behaviors in mice/rats. Mechanistically, Q11 attenuated microglial activation, neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation by suppressing the PI3K/Akt, STAT1/3, and NF-κB signaling pathways. These findings establish CYP2E1 as a druggable target for neuroinflammation and propose Q11 as a promising candidate for treating neuroinflammation-related diseases.",Free Radic Biol Med

40110639,Distinct medical and substance use histories associate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Phenotype clustering reduces patient heterogeneity and could be useful when designing precision clinical trials. We hypothesized that the onset of early cognitive decline in patients would exhibit variance predicated on the clinical history documented prior to an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.
METHODS: Self-reported medical and substance use history (i.e., problem history) was used to cluster participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) into distinct subtypes. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to determine the effect of problem history subtype on cognitive decline over 2 years.
RESULTS: Two thousand seven hundred fifty-four individuals were partitioned into three subtypes: minimal (n = 1380), substance use (n = 1038), and cardiovascular (n = 336). The cardiovascular problem history subtype had significantly worse cognitive decline over a 2 year follow-up period (p = 0.013).
DISCUSSION: Our study highlights the need to account for problem history to reduce heterogeneity of outcomes in AD clinical trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Clinical data were used to identify subtypes of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. Three problem history subtypes were found: minimal, substance use, and cardiovascular. The mean change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was assessed over a 2 year follow-up. The cardiovascular subtype was associated with the worst cognitive decline. The magnitude of change in CDR-SB was similar to recent AD clinical trials.",Alzheimers Dement
40084669,Salivary biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies.,"BackgroundDespite dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) being the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, more than 80% of DLB cases are initially misdiagnosed. Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and tau species have been detected in peripheral tissues and biological fluids of DLB patients and among different biological fluids, saliva represent an easely accessible and non-invasive source for biomarker detection.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate salivary a-syn and tau species as molecular disease biomarkers, assessing their potential in the diagnosis of DLB and in the differential diagnosis on respect to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).MethodsWe measured total and oligomeric a-syn, total-tau, and S199-phosphorylated-tau (pS199-tau) in the saliva of 21 DLB, 20 AD, 20 PD patients, and 20 healthy subjects (HS) using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses.ResultsSalivary total a-syn was not significantly changed between the different groups, whereas all pathological groups had a higher oligomeric a-syn concentration than HS. Salivary total-tau concentration was higher in all the pathological groups than HS, whereas the concentrations did not differ among patients' groups. Conversely, salivary levels of pS199-tau was higher in DLB and AD patients than in HS and PD patients. Both correlation matrix and principal component analysis showed that core clinical DLB features were related to a-syn pathology, while cognitive decline was associated with salivary levels of pS199-tau in both DLB and AD patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis reported high diagnostic accuracy for both a-syn oligomers and pS199-tau, between DLB and HS, and an adequate accuracy between DLB and PD. Conversely, the diagnostic accuracy was not optimal between DLB patients and AD patients.ConclusionsThese findings provide preliminary evidence that salivary a-syn and tau species might be promising in identifying DLB patients on respect to PD patients and HS, while the diagnostic potential is limited on respect to AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40117152,MSAFF: Multi-Way Soft Attention Fusion Framework With the Large Foundation Models for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Complementary information in multi-omics data are crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, existing studies face challenges in addressing the high-level noise and heterogeneity in multi-omics data. This article presents a novel approach that combines large foundation models (LFMs) with soft attention mechanisms to enhance, select, and fuse multi-omics features, thereby improving the performance of disease classification. Specifically, we first propose a mathematical model based on soft attention mechanisms. This model employs multi-head attention (MHA) and self-attention (SA) for feature selection, and uses cross-attention (CA) for feature fusion. Then, a multi-way soft attention fusion framework (MSAFF) with LFMs is proposed. In this approach, biomedical LFMs are used to construct low-noise biomedical features. The multi-way soft attention algorithm implements effective feature selection and fusion described in the mathematical model. Experimental results on the public imaging genetics datasets demonstrate the advanced performances of MSAFF in both disease classification and AD-related pathogeny discrimination. This article provides intelligent support for the diagnosis and pathogenesis research of AD. Our code can be accessed at github.com/fmri123456/MSAFF.",IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst
40054570,Snapshot of disease continuum centered on Alzheimer's disease: Exploring modifiable risk factors.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment, with a complex etiology involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Traditionally, AD has been studied in isolation, but emerging evidence highlights its interconnectedness with various comorbidities across multiple organ systems. This study introduces a Disease-Wide Association Study (DWAS) approach to explore the disease continuum centered around AD. Using the FinnGen cohort, which includes over 392,000 participants, this study systematically analyzed the comorbidities associated with AD, spanning cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, digestive, and oncological conditions. These findings reveal that AD is part of a much broader, systemic disease continuum, with shared pathophysiological mechanisms, including chronic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and vascular health, which may influence AD onset and progression. Temporal analysis of pre- and post-AD comorbidities identifies modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes that may not only precede AD but also exacerbate its progression. The study emphasizes the importance of an integrated care approach for AD patients, addressing both neurological and systemic health to improve outcomes. Furthermore, by identifying modifiable risk factors, this research opens new avenues for early interventions aimed at delaying or preventing AD. These findings challenge the traditional view of AD as an isolated disease and provide insights into the shared etiology of AD and its comorbidities, offering potential targets for personalized therapeutic strategies and public health policies.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry
40165586,Alpha-Synuclein Demonstrates Varying Binding Affinities With Different Tau Isoforms.,"The hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation and aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in synucleinopathies. Many neurodegenerative diseases express mixed pathology. For instance, Lewy bodies are reported in tauopathies and neurofibrillary tau-tangles are detected in synucleinopathies, suggesting a potential co-existence or crosstalk of misfolded aSyn and tau. In the present study, we investigated the binding characteristics of monomeric aSyn with different tau isoforms by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy allowing monitoring direct protein-protein interactions and their potential co-localization using SH-SY5Y cells. The calculation of the binding parameters (association and dissociation rate constants) indicated the strongest binding affinity between aSyn and tau isoform 1N3R followed by tau 2N3R and tau 2N4R. Co-localization studies in SH-SY5Y cells, treated with aSyn and all six tau isoforms revealed an intracellular co-localization of aSyn with different isoforms of tau. Subcellular fractionation confirmed the cellular uptake and colocalization of tau and aSyn in the same compartment, showing their expression in membrane, nuclear, and cytoskeletal fractions. Understanding the intricate interplay between aSyn and tau is crucial for unraveling the pathophysiology of PD, AD, and related neurodegenerative disorders, ultimately paving the way for the development of effective treatments targeting this interaction. In conclusion, our data indicate that aSyn and tau are direct interaction partners with varying binding affinities depending on the tau isoform. This interaction may be significant for understanding the pathophysiology of dementia with mixed pathologies.",J Neurochem
40145365,Exploring the structure and stability of pentameric amyloid β peptide aggregates in aqueous ammonium-based ionic liquid solutions.,"The self-assembly of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins into fibrils is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble pentamers, particularly those formed in the early stages of Aβ aggregation, are considered highly neurotoxic. This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to explore how trimethylammonium chloride (TMAC), cholinium chloride (ChoC), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) ionic liquids (ILs) affect the conformational stability and the association mechanism of Aβ pentameters. These ILs, characterized by varying hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, exert differential effects on the conformatioanl flexibility of Aβ pentameters. Computational analyses reveal that TBAC induces greater conformational flexibility and multiple energetically favorable states for the Aβ pentamer, potentially driving the pentamerization process along various pathways to form different polymorphic Aβ fibrillar structures. Moreover, analysis of solvent distributions demonstrates that exchange of water by IL ion pairs at the pentamer's exterior surface primarily occurs beyond the first layer of surface-bound water molecules. Particularly, hydrophobic TBA cations show an enhanced propensity to replace weakly interacting water molecules on the surface. Mechanistic insights derived from umbrella sampling simulations further elucidate how ILs modulate the association/dissociation of Aβ monomers within pentameric aggregates. Our findings indicate that the binding of the Aβ peptide becomes less favorable and the binding free energy decreases when transitioning from TMAC to TBAC solutions, as compared to a pure aqueous solution. Finally, energy landscape analysis of Aβ peptide docking to Aβ pentameters reveals multiple low-energy conformations, which are more dispersed in the presence of ChoC and TBAC solutions, potentially hindering Aβ prefibril growth.",Phys Chem Chem Phys
40092057,Redefining disease in the age of blood-based biomarkers.,"This article explores the sociological and ethical implications of redefining disease in the era of advanced diagnostic technologies, with a focus on blood-based biomarkers. Drawing from Foucault's concept of medicalization and Illich's critique of disease mongering, it highlights how diagnostic expansions, driven by corporate and institutional influences, are reshaping the boundaries of health and disease. Advances such as blood assays for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, liquid biopsies in oncology, and biomarkers for depression and diabetes, while promising, raise concerns about premature diagnoses and overtreatment. The influence of pharmaceutical and insurance industries on diagnostic criteria, as seen in the ICD updates, underscores the need to address conflicts of interest and regulatory gaps. Case studies on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's reveal how these changes could benefit stakeholders at the expense of patient welfare. The article calls for ethical oversight, stricter regulation, and research into the population-level efficacy of diagnostic and treatment protocols.",Front Sociol
40082316,A novel method for harmonization of PET image spatial resolution without phantoms.,"BACKGROUND: Estimation of the spatial resolution in real images is extremely important in several fields, including crystallography, optics, microscopy, and tomography. In human PET imaging, estimating spatial resolution typically involves the acquisition of images from a physical phantom, typically a Hoffman phantom, which poses a logistical burden, especially in large multi-center studies. Indeed, phantom images may not always be readily available, and this method requires constant monitoring of scanner updates or replacements, scanning protocol changes, and image reconstruction guidelines to establish a equivalence with scans acquired from human subjects.
METHODS: We propose a new computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from human subject PET images. The proposed technique is based on the generalization of the logarithmic intensity plots in the 2D Fourier domain to the 3D case. The spatial resolution of the image is obtained through the estimated coefficients of a multiple linear regression problem having the logarithm of the squared norm of the Fourier transform as dependent variable and the squared 3D frequencies as multiple predictors.
RESULTS: The proposed approach was applied to a cohort of subjects consisting of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms from a Phase II clinical trial, and a second cohort including β-amyloid, FDG, and tau PET images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The resulting in-plane and axial resolution estimators varied between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. They also yielded less than one voxel size across-subjects variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also proved that the spatial resolution estimators showed: (1) a very high reproducibility, as measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC > 0.985), (2) a strong cross-tracer linear correlations, and (3) a high within-subject longitudinal consistency, as measured by the maximum difference value between pairs of visits from the same subject.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach does not only eliminate the need for surrogate phantom data, but also provides a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of tracers and other imaging modalities, such as SPECT.

40125707,Role of Testosterone Signaling in Microglia: A Potential Role for Sex-Related Differences in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is less prevalent in men than in women, although mechanisms remain unclear. Microglia degrade aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) through the lysosomal system, including autophagy. G protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 member A (GPRC6A), predominantly expressed in mouse microglial MG6 cells, is a primary mediator of testosterone signaling. This study examines testosterone's role in modulating Aβ-induced autophagy in microglia. Testosterone promotes Aβ-induced autophagy leading to Aβ clearance in MG6 cells by suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and subsequently inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, which is abrogated by shRNA knockdown of GPRC6A. In in vivo experiments with male 5xFAD AD model mice, Aβ clearance activity is associated with autophagy in microglia and is reduced by orchiectomy, but restored by testosterone supplementation. ERK phosphorylation in the brains of male AD model mice is upregulated by orchiectomy. Therefore, testosterone is involved in autophagy-mediated Aβ clearance in microglia. Aβ accumulation in human brain samples from patients with AD is significantly lower in men than in women, with less pronounced colocalization of Aβ with p62 aggregates, suggesting enhanced autophagic activity in men. In conclusion, testosterone enhances Aβ-induced autophagy in microglia, possibly contributing to lower susceptibility to AD in men.",Adv Sci (Weinh)
40128806,High-dimensional mediation analysis reveals the mediating role of physical activity patterns in genetic pathways leading to AD-like brain atrophy.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder that affects multiple biological systems including cognition, behavior and physical health. Unfortunately, the pathogenic mechanisms behind AD are not yet clear and the treatment options are still limited. Despite the increasing number of studies examining the pairwise relationships between genetic factors, physical activity (PA), and AD, few have successfully integrated all three domains of data, which may help reveal mechanisms and impact of these genomic and phenomic factors on AD. We use high-dimensional mediation analysis as an integrative framework to study the relationships among genetic factors, PA and AD-like brain atrophy quantified by spatial patterns of brain atrophy.
RESULTS: We integrate data from genetics, PA and neuroimaging measures collected from 13,425 UK Biobank samples to unveil the complex relationship among genetic risk factors, behavior and brain signatures in the contexts of aging and AD. Specifically, we used a composite imaging marker, Spatial Pattern of Abnormality for Recognition of Early AD (SPARE-AD) that characterizes AD-like brain atrophy, as an outcome variable to represent AD risk. Through GWAS, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with SPARE-AD as exposure variables. We employed conventional summary statistics and functional principal component analysis to extract patterns of PA as mediators. After constructing these variables, we utilized a high-dimensional mediation analysis method, Bayesian Mediation Analysis (BAMA), to estimate potential mediating pathways between SNPs, multivariate PA signatures and SPARE-AD. BAMA incorporates Bayesian continuous shrinkage prior to select the active mediators from a large pool of candidates. We identified a total of 22 mediation pathways, indicating how genetic variants can influence SPARE-AD by altering physical activity. By comparing the results with those obtained using univariate mediation analysis, we demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional mediation analysis methods over univariate mediation analysis.
CONCLUSION: Through integrative analysis of multi-omics data, we identified several mediation pathways of physical activity between genetic factors and SPARE-AD. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Moreover, our research demonstrates the potential of the high-dimensional mediation analysis method in revealing the mechanisms of disease.",BioData Min

The inflammatory response triggered by gut microbiota may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the impact of gut microbiota on emotional state, known as the ""Gut-mood"" relationship, could play a role in depression and anxiety disorders.
RESULTS: This review summarizes recent data on the role of gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, brain cancer, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder and stroke. Also, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study on seven neurological disorders (Epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, brain cancer, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder and stroke). MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests confirmed the robustness of analysis against horizontal pleiotropy.
CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the protective and risk factors for neurological disorders found in our research and other researches, we can furtherly determine valuable indicators for disease evolution tracking and potential treatment targets. Future research should explore extensive microbiome genome-wide association study datasets using metagenomics sequencing techniques to deepen our understanding of connections and causality between neurological disorders.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol
40122399,Advanced biomarkers: Beyond amyloid and tau: Emerging non-traditional biomarkers for alzheimer`s diagnosis and progression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive cognitive decline and imposes a significant socio-economic burden. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily based on amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau biomarkers, often identify the disease at late stages, highlighting the need for more sensitive and accessible early detection tools. This review explores emerging non-traditional biomarkers, including salivary, lipid, urinary, synaptic, blood-based, microRNA (miRNA), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), fecal, and inflammatory markers, which provide deeper insights into AD pathophysiology. These biomarkers reflect key pathological processes such as neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, synaptic damage, lipid dysregulation, and genetic factors. Non-invasive biomarkers, such as those found in saliva and urine, present promising avenues for large-scale screening, while advanced blood-based markers like neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) offer precise monitoring of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, miRNAs and lipid biomarkers shed light on molecular alterations in neuronal health and signaling. Integrating these biomarkers with imaging techniques, proteomics, and genetic profiling enhances diagnostic accuracy and enables personalized treatment approaches. This shift toward multi-dimensional biomarker assessment not only improves early detection but also aids in tailoring therapeutic strategies to individual disease profiles. By reviewing recent advancements, this article highlights the transformative potential of emerging biomarkers in overcoming the limitations of conventional diagnostics. Standardization and validation across diverse populations will be crucial in expanding their clinical applicability, ultimately improving disease management, reducing societal burden, and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by AD.",Ageing Res Rev

40053458,Computer-aided drug design approach for alkaloids isolated from Stephania glandulifera Miers as potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.,"Considering the medicinal importance of alkaloids from Stephania glandulifera Miers, five major compounds (stepharine, stepharanine, stepholidine, palmatine and tetrahydropalmatine) from the plant were analyzed for their acetylcholinesterase activity using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and in silico pharmacokinetics. As acetylcholinesterase has been significantly studied for their role in Alzheimer's disease, the enzyme from Torpedo californica (PDB ID: 1QTI) was taken as a receptor protein. AutoDock Vina was used to study the docking affinities during the initial screening of compounds where, stepharine showed promising binding energy (-10.3 kcal/mol) forming crucial interactions with active site residues (His 440, Tyr 121, and Trp 84). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for 200 ns to analyze the stability of the docked complex. The study of trajectories obtained after simulation showed stepharine with a strong binding affinity and stability with AChE. Moreover, drug likeness and ADMET analysis conducted via Swiss ADME and pKCSM affirmed stepharine's favorable pharmacological properties. Overall, this research highlights stepharine as a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which could be further developed as potential drug against Alzheimer's disease.",J Biomol Struct Dyn
40139174,Thyroid Disorders as a Risk Factor for Neurodegenerative Proteinopathies: A Large-Scale Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between thyroid disorders and neurodegenerative diseases remains poorly understood. This large-scale retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the association between thyroid disorders and various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the potential impact of thyroidectomy.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,719,666 patients with thyroid disorders and 2,945,438 controls from 120 healthcare organizations. After propensity score matching, each group included 2,033,096 patients. We compared the risk of neurodegenerative diseases between these groups and examined the effect of thyroidectomy in a subgroup analysis of 31,753 matched pairs.
RESULTS: Patients with thyroid disorders showed significantly higher risks of Alzheimer's disease (RR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.110-1.195), Parkinson's disease (RR=1.25, 95%CI: 1.187-1.318), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RR=1.35, 95%CI: 1.131-1.622), frontotemporal dementia (RR=1.44, 95%CI: 1.219-1.702), Lewy body dementia (RR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.107-1.186), progressive supranuclear palsy (RR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.095-1.819), vascular dementia (RR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.266-1.369), Niemann-Pick disease type C (RR=1.34, 95%CI: 1.092-1.638), and Wilson's disease (RR=1.26, 95%CI: 1.056-1.507). Interestingly, the risk of multiple sclerosis was lower (RR=0.80, 95%CI: 0.738-0.862). Thyroidectomy was associated with a 44.2% lower risk of Lewy body dementia (RR=0.558, 95%CI: 0.339-0.919, p=0.020).
CONCLUSION: Thyroid disorders are significantly associated with an increased risk of several neurodegenerative diseases. Thyroidectomy may have a protective effect against Lewy body dementia. These findings suggest a complex relationship between thyroid function and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for neurological monitoring in patients with thyroid disorders and further research into thyroid-brain interactions.",Neuroepidemiology
40019732,Phenotype-specific metabolic patterns in Posterior cortical atrophy and early-onset typical Alzheimer's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is generally considered an atypical variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is an important component of early-onset AD. Symptomatologic heterogeneity has led to a high rate of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of early-onset AD. We sought to establish the phenotypic-specific metabolic patterns of PCA and early-onset typical AD (tAD) and to assess whether phenotype-specific neuroimaging biomarkers are more valuable for disease recognition.
METHODS: Patients accepting <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET with an onset age younger than 65 years (PCA, n = 40; early-onset tAD, n = 37; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), n = 35) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 30) were enrolled and divided into two cohorts for pattern establishment and validation, respectively. Similarities and differences between patterns were assessed by pattern topography, expression, classification performance and correlation with clinical severity.
RESULTS: PCA-related pattern (PCARP) was characterized by extensively relative hypometabolism in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus, and relative hypermetabolism mainly in vermis, thalamus. Early-onset tAD-related pattern (EOtADRP) was characterized by relative hypometabolism mainly in the middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, caudate, and relative hypermetabolism mainly in vermis, thalamus, postcentral gyrus. PCARP and EOtADRP were closely related in topography (r = 0.909, P < 0.001) and expression (r = 0.862, P < 0.001). High accuracies in distinguishing corresponding patient group from HC were found in both, while only PCARP was capable of phenotype discrimination (PCA versus early-onset tAD; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.84-0.88 for PCARP, AUC = 0.57-0.62 for EOtADRP) and distinguishment between PCA/early-onset tAD and bv-FTD (AUC = 1.00/0.91 for PCARP, AUC = 0.73/0.62 for EOtADRP). PCARP showed great potential in detecting clinical severity in both phenotypes whereas EOtADRP only worked in early-onset tAD.
CONCLUSION: PCARP outperformed EOtADRP in phenotype discrimination with better potential in severity assessment.",Ann Nucl Med
40076922,Unraveling the Roles of UBE3A in Neurodevelopment and Neurodegeneration.,"The ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A, aka E6-AP), an E3 ligase belonging to the HECT family, plays crucial roles in the stability of various proteins through the proteasomal degradation system. Abnormal UBE3A activity is essential for the initiation and progression of several cancers. A gain of function and an overdosage of maternal UBE3A is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders. Conversely, a loss of function due to mutations, deletions, paternal duplications, or imprinting defects in neurons leads to Angelman syndrome. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal UBE3A activity may also contribute to the development of various brain disorders, including schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, making UBE3A a protein of significant interest. However, research on UBE3A's functions in the brain has primarily focused on neurons due to the imprinting of UBE3A in mature neuronal cells, while being obscured in glia. This review outlines the expression of UBE3A in neurons and glial cells based on published studies, highlights newly identified patterns of UBE3A, such as its secretion, and emphasizes the involvement of UBE3A in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we summarize glial UBE3A and propose a model of bi-directional interactions between the neurons and glia mediated by UBE3A that underlies brain functions. Insights gained from this research could provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting various brain disorders.",Int J Mol Sci
40000032,Updates on vascular dementia.,"Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). In comparison to AD, there is a decline in the incidence of VaD due to recent improvements in cardiovascular risk factors. Brain hypoperfusion and hypoxia due to vascular pathologies have been postulated as the primary disease mechanism of VaD. However, other factors such as neuroinflammation may also contribute to the development of VaD. Non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors have been attributed to VaD. The clinical features overlapping between AD and VaD create significant challenges for physicians. Newly developed biomarkers may potentially help differentiate VaD from other forms of dementia. Unlike AD, there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved drug or device for treating VaD. Current treatment options mainly target symptoms rather than slowing the development or progression of VaD. There are ongoing research studies testing the efficacy of various therapeutic strategies for VaD. In this narrative review, we will summarise current findings on epidemiology, attributed risk factors and disease mechanisms, as well as emphasise the importance of optimising lifestyle modifications and comorbid condition management in preventing or slowing down the development of VaD.

However, the relationships between C1q and the major pathological challenges, including amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau deposition, remain undetermined in the preclinical AD phase.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the connections between plasma C1q and CSF AD biomarkers.MethodsThe cognitively intact participants (N = 1264) from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study were categorized into four groups, including Stage 0 [normal Amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>), Phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and Total-tau (T-tau)], Stage 1 (abnormal Aβ<sub>1-42,</sub> but normal P-tau or T-tau), Stage 2 (abnormal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and abnormal P-tau or T-tau), and suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology (SNAP) (abnormal P-tau or T-tau, but normal amyloid levels). The changes in plasma C1q levels among these groups and the correlation between C1q levels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers were performed.ResultsThe results demonstrated plasma C1q levels are lower in Stage 0 (p = 0.010) and SNAP (p &lt; 0.001) compared with Stage 1. A significant association between C1q levels and CSF AD pathology, including Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (β = -0.143, p &lt; 0.001), Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>/Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> (β = -0.173, p &lt; 0.001), P-tau/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (β = 0.156, p &lt; 0.001), and T-tau/Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (β = 0.130, p &lt; 0.001) has been identified.ConclusionsThe current research elucidates a positive correlation between elevated plasma C1q levels and CSF Aβ pathology, with C1q amplifying concomitantly with the pathological and clinical progression of AD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40076772,"Shape Matters: The Utility and Analysis of Altered Yeast Mitochondrial Morphology in Health, Disease, and Biotechnology.","Mitochondria are involved in a wide array of critical cellular processes from energy production to cell death. The morphology (size and shape) of mitochondrial compartments is highly responsive to both intracellular and extracellular conditions, making these organelles highly dynamic. Nutrient levels and stressors both inside and outside the cell inform the balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion and the recycling of mitochondrial components known as mitophagy. The study of mitochondrial morphology and its implications in human disease and microbial engineering have gained significant attention over the past decade. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a valuable model system for studying mitochondria due to its ability to survive without respiring, its genetic tractability, and the high degree of mitochondrial similarity across eukaryotic species. Here, we review how the interplay between mitochondrial fission, fusion, biogenesis, and mitophagy regulates the dynamic nature of mitochondrial networks in both yeast and mammalian systems with an emphasis on yeast as a model organism. Additionally, we examine the crucial role of inter-organelle interactions, particularly between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. The dysregulation of any of these processes gives rise to abnormal mitochondrial morphologies, which serve as the distinguishing features of numerous diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Notably, yeast models have contributed to revealing the underlying mechanisms driving these human disease states. In addition to furthering our understanding of pathologic processes, aberrant yeast mitochondrial morphologies are of increasing interest to the seemingly distant field of metabolic engineering, following the discovery that compartmentalization of certain biosynthetic pathways within mitochondria can significantly improve chemical production. In this review, we examine the utility of yeast as a model organism to study mitochondrial morphology in both healthy and pathologic states, explore the nascent field of mitochondrial morphology engineering, and discuss the methods available for the quantification and classification of these key mitochondrial morphologies.",Int J Mol Sci
40134421,The immunomodulatory effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists in neurogenerative diseases and ischemic stroke treatment.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor is widely distributed in the digestive system, cardiovascular system, adipose tissue and central nervous system. Numerous GLP-1 receptor-targeting drugs have been investigated in clinical studies for various indications, including type 2 diabetes and obesity (accounts for 70% of the total studies), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. This review presented fundamental information regarding two categories of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs): peptide-based and small molecule compounds, and elaborated their potential neuroprotective effects by inhibiting neuroinflammation, reducing neuronal apoptosis, and ultimately improving cognitive function in various neurodegenerative diseases. As a new hypoglycemic drug, GLP-1RA has a unique role in reducing the concurrent risk of stroke in T2D patients. Given the infiltration of various peripheral immune cells into brain tissue, particularly in the areas surrounding the infarct lesion, we further investigated the potential immune regulatory mechanisms. GLP-1RA could not only facilitate the M2 polarization of microglia through both direct and indirect pathways, but also modulate the quantity and function of T cell subtypes, including CD4, CD8, and regulatory T cells, resulting into the inhibition of inflammatory responses and the promotion of neuronal regeneration through interleukin-10 secretion. Therefore, we believe that the ""Tregs-microglia-neuron/neural precursor cells"" axis is instrumental in mediating immune suppression and neuroprotection in the context of ischemic stroke. Given the benefits of rapid diffusion, favorable blood-brain barrier permeability and versatile administration routes, these small molecule compounds will be one of the important candidates of GLP-1RA. We look forward to the further clinical evidence of small molecule GLP-1RA intervention in ischemic stroke or T2D complicated by ischemic stroke.",Front Immunol
40110626,Blood biomarkers differentiate AD-related versus non-AD-related cognitive deficits.,"INTRODUCTION: The utility of blood-based biomarkers for discriminating Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related versus non-AD-related cognitive deficits in preclinical populations remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the capability of blood markers to detect and discriminate variation in performance across multiple cognitive domains in a cognitively unimpaired sample.
METHODS: Participants (n = 648, aged 69.9 ± 3.8, 71% female) underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and assays for plasma-based biomarkers amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/1-40 by mass spectrometry, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, p-tau217/Aβ1-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL).
RESULTS: Greater p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory performance (β = -0.11, SE = 0.04, p = .003), and remained so after covarying for NfL. Higher NfL was non-specifically associated with poorer performance across a range of cognitive domains and remained so after covarying for p-tau217.
DISCUSSION: Blood-based biomarkers may differentiate non-AD-related versus AD-related cognitive deficits. This characterization will be important for early intervention and disease monitoring for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: There is heterogeneity in the causes of cognitive decline in aging. AD-related blood biomarkers may help characterize these causes. Elevated p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory. Elevated NfL was associated with poorer cognition in a broad range of domains. Blood biomarkers may help differentiate AD- and non-AD-related cognitive deficits.",Alzheimers Dement
39976746,Chitinase-3 Like-Protein-1 Signature in Neurological Disorders: Emphasis on Stroke.,"Chitinase-3 like-protein-1 (CHI3L1) is a protein involved in various pathological conditions, including infectious, allergic, metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In the central nervous system, glial cells, especially activated astrocytes, are the primary sources of CHI3L1 synthesis and secretion. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, elevated levels of CHI3L1 are correlated with greater cognitive decline and neuroinflammation. Regarding stroke, CHI3L1 is a relevant biomarker associated with an increased risk of adverse events and mortality, particularly in patients with elevated levels following the onset of symptoms. Overall, the presence of CHI3L1 may reflect disease severity and aid in predicting outcomes. This narrative review explores the potential role of CHI3L1 in neurological diseases, with an emphasis on stroke, and it may contribute to guiding the development of effective inhibitors, which could be an attractive therapeutic approach for treating this condition.",J Mol Neurosci
40157707,Donepezil-induced Degradation of hERG Potassium Channel via Lysosomal Pathway is Exacerbated by Hypoxia.,"Donepezil (DPZ), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, has drawn attention for causing prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes (TdP). Acquired long QT syndrome (acLQTS) is usually caused by blockage of the cardiac potassium current I<sub>Kr</sub>/hERG, which is essential for cardiac repolarization. This study aimed to investigate DPZ's effect on hERG channel and its cardiotoxic mechanism, particularly focusing on whether hypoxia increases the risk of DPZ-induced acLQTS. To explore these, we employed western blotting to analyze protein levels, the patch clamp technique to measure hERG current and the action potentials of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Additionally, immunoprecipitation was utilized to detect protein-protein interactions. Finally, optical mapping monitored guinea pig ECGs and APD, providing in vivo insights. Our results indicate that 24-hour incubation with DPZ inhibits hERG protein levels and current in the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, DPZ induces an imbalance in hERG protein acetylation/ubiquitination and decreases the stability of hERG by promoting HDAC6 expression, and the ubiquitinated hERG protein was degraded at lysosomes via K63-polyubiquitin chains. DPZ affects hERG membrane protein via two pathways: it accelerates endocytosis and directs degradation via CHMP3 (a sorting protein of ESCRT-III), while inhibiting recycling through Rab11. Hypoxia exacerbates DPZ-induced hERG degradation and APD prolongation in guinea pigs and hiPSC-CMs. Collectively, DPZ reduces hERG protein stability in the membrane, promoting its degradation in lysosomes. Hypoxia further exacerbates the risk of arrhythmia caused by DPZ. These findings remind us to pay attention to acLQTS induced by DPZ inhibition of hERG in clinical applications.",Eur J Pharmacol
40025711,Revisiting the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in a European cohort of elderly living with type 2 diabetes.,"BackgroundIndividuals with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia.ObjectiveThis prospective cross-sectional study assessed the screening ability of the standard Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score suggestive of mild cognitive impairment (<26) in a European cohort of individuals ≥65 of age with type 2 diabetes.MethodsParticipants of RECOGNISED, a European prospective EU-funded cohort study, were screened using MoCA. In addition, a 13-item Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) with the Clinical Dementia Rating was undertaken to categorize participants as normocognitive (NC, n = 128) or mild cognitive impaired (MCI, n = 185). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the ability of MoCA cut-off scores to categorize patients as having MCI or not.ResultsThe standard MoCA cut-off of 25/26 demonstrated a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 51%, resulting in a false positive rate of 20%. ROC analysis showed that a MoCA cut-off of 24/25 has a better balance between sensitivity (81%) and specificity (62%), with a lower false positive rate of 16%. NTB results showed that the MCI group had the lowest norm-referenced percentile scores in the visuo-construction domain, a known early feature of Alzheimer's disease and a significant predictor of a rapid rate of disease progression.ConclusionsMoCA as a screening tool in individuals ≥65 with type 2 diabetes, overestimates the prevalence of MCI, even when applying lower cut-offs. More specific screening strategies are necessary, particularly targeting the visuo-construction domain, to effectively identify cognitive impairment in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",J Alzheimers Dis
40156582,Assessing the Effects of Home-Based Primary Care on Alzheimer's Caregivers and Support Organizations: An Application of the Health Equity Implementation Framework.,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) pose significant challenges for care partners and community-based organizations (CBOs) involved in providing care. Home-based medical care (HBMC) models have emerged as a potentially equitable solution to support these individuals and organizations. Utilizing the Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF), this study explores the barriers and facilitators experienced by care partners and CBO staff in Black and Latino communities. Data were collected through thirteen semi-structured interviews and four focus groups, with participants recruited from those providing care to patients enrolled in the AHWFB house call program in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish, and thematic analysis was applied to the data to identify key themes within the HEIF domains. I-Poems were presented to participants as a member-checking technique. The study identified historical mistrust and systemic racism, economic barriers, and logistical challenges as significant impediments to healthcare access. Cultural beliefs and care partner roles were explored in the context of Black and Latino care partners and their impact on approaches to care of PLWD. The HBMC model was valued for its convenience and personalized approach, though participants identified a need for improved communication with providers and greater cultural sensitivity. Additionally, participants from focus groups and caregiver interviews provided several actionable recommendations for enhancing the healthcare experiences of those dealing with ADRD.",Qual Health Res
40123156,Unraveling the Controversy: The Causal Link Between Osteoarthritis and Alzheimer's Disease.,"OBJECTIVES: Research on osteoarthritis (OA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently highly controversial, and the upstream and downstream relationships between them remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between OA and AD using Mendelian randomization (MR).
METHOD: Summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were obtained for OA and AD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), and significant (p &lt; 5.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and independent (r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001) SNPs were extracted for two-sample MR analyses. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used to assess these causal relationships, and meta-analysis was used to combine MR results from multiple IVWs. Confounders were assessed by multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR). Results were reported as odds ratios (OR). Heterogeneity was then tested using Cochran's Q test, multiplicity was tested using the MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO, and sensitivity analyses were performed using the leave-one-out sensitivity test.
RESULTS: The MR results showed a positive causal effect of AD and OA (IVW OR = 19.89, 95% CI = 2.90-136.57, p = 0.002; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.11-1.47, p = 0.017; OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.11-1.46, p = 0.017) and no significance of the reverse MR results (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis of the MR results confirmed this finding and was significant in all population subgroups (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.18-1.40). The findings were maintained after controlling confounders using MVMR (OR = 6.75, 95% CI = 1.50-30.44, p = 0.013). These analyses were confirmed to be reliable and stable by sensitivity testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found a positive causal effect of OA and AD, which was confirmed by the highest levels of evidence-based medicine. It may provide meaningful evidence for the current controversy.",Brain Behav
40119956,The role of VEGF in vascular dementia: impact of aging and cellular senescence.,"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a critical element in vascular dementia (VD) pathogenesis and therapeutic development while remaining strongly influenced by aging processes and cellular aging mechanisms. VEGF's multiple effects comprise neuroprotective functions, its role in vascular development, and its ability to regulate brain blood flow systems, all leading to cognitive preservation. The prefrontal cortex exhibits elevated VEGF gene levels, which directly matches the advancement of cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease and VD. These patients exhibit higher VEGF levels in their CSF fluid, demonstrating that disease pathology includes multiple inseparable factors. Aging dramatically worsens VEGF regulation because endothelial dysfunction combines with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to generate adverse vascular symptoms that include atherosclerosis and stroke. Cellular senescence convolutes these processes by causing damaging inflammatory reactions alongside impaired vascular healing abilities. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from senescent cells (SCs) disrupts VEGF signaling and produces harmful consequences for both vascular health and cognitive well-being. The neuroprotective properties of VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b variants demonstrate their ability to lessen β-amyloid and tau protein toxicity. The protective mechanisms of VEGF depend heavily on VEGF expression levels and receptor functionality, both of which decrease with aging. The combination of approaches that modulate VEGF signaling and SC accumulation shows potential for designing treatments against VD. People can sustain BBB functionality over a longer period through Mediterranean diet consumption together with aerobic exercise along with developing therapies, including senolytics and senomorphics, which delay neurodegenerative progression. Future investigative efforts must improve VEGF delivery methods while studying cellular senescence mechanisms and developing advanced methods to detect SC cells. A three-dimensional healthcare approach combining VEGF-targeted treatments with anti-ageing interventions and detailed diagnostic techniques shows the potential for effective VD management to achieve better patient results.",Biogerontology
40058654,Unlocking the potential of EEG in Alzheimer's disease research: Current status and pathways to precision detection.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of individuals worldwide and is considered a serious global health issue due to its gradual neuro-degenerative effects on cognitive abilities such as memory, thinking, and behavior. There is no cure for this disease but early detection along with a supportive care plan may aid in improving the quality of life for patients. Automated detection of AD is challenging because its symptoms vary in patients due to genetic, environmental, or other co-existing health conditions. In recent years, multiple researchers have proposed automated detection methods for AD using MRI and fMRI. These approaches are expensive, have poor temporal resolution, do not offer real-time insights, and have not proven to be very accurate. In contrast, only a limited number of studies have explored the potential of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for AD detection. In contrast, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals present a cost-effective, non-invasive, and high-temporal-resolution alternative for AD detection. Despite their potential, the application of EEG signals in AD research remains under-explored. This study reviews publicly available EEG datasets, the variety of machine learning models developed for automated AD detection, and the performance metrics achieved by these methods. It provides a critical analysis of existing approaches, highlights challenges, and identifies key areas requiring further investigation. Key findings include a detailed evaluation of current methodologies, prevailing trends, and potential gaps in the field. What sets this work apart is its in-depth analysis of EEG signals for Alzheimer's Disease detection, providing a stronger and more reliable foundation for understanding the potential role of EEG in this area.",Brain Res Bull
39989634,Understanding basic and social emotions in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent developments in the field of social cognition have led to a renewed interest in basic and social emotion recognition in early stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and FrontoTemporal Dementia (FTD). Despite the growing attention to this issue, only few studies have attempted to investigate emotion recognition using both visual and vocal stimuli. In addition, recent studies have presented conflicting findings regarding the extent of impairment in patients in the early stages of these diseases. The present study aims to investigate emotion understanding (both basic and social emotions), using different tasks with visual and auditory stimuli, to identify supramodal deficits in AD and FTD to provide a reliable tool to better outline their behavioral and emotional profile and useful instruments for their management.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with AD and 15 patients with FTD were included in the study. Healthy control (HCs) subjects were recruited to obtain normative data for basic emotion recognition tests and social emotion recognition tasks. To evaluate basic emotion recognition, the Facial Emotion Recognition Battery (FERB) and the Emotional Prosody Recognition Battery (EPRB) were administered. To evaluate social emotion recognition, the Faux Pas (FP), Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME), and Reading the Mind in the Voice (RMV) tests were employed.
RESULTS: FTD patients performed significantly worse than HCs in most of the subtests of the basic emotion recognition batteries, where, instead, AD patients were significantly impaired only when required to match emotional facial expression in different individuals (subtask of the FERB). Moreover, FTD patients scored significantly lower in RME and RMV tests compared both to AD patients and to HCs. In addition, ADs were selectively impaired in RMV as respect to HCs.
DISCUSSION: FTD patients showed deficits in emotion recognition, affecting both basic and social emotions, whether conveyed through facial expressions or prosody. This result may explain the well-known social behavioral difficulties observed in FTD patients from the early stages of the disease. The fewer and specific deficits in AD patients with comparable MMSE scores may be attributed to the mild degree of impairment, as these deficits may appear later in the progression of AD.",Front Psychol
40105475,Identifying microglia-derived NFKBIA as a potential contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) place considerable health burden on affected individuals and significant economic burden on society.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the shared cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD and AMD.MethodsThe investigation in this study is conducted via single-cell and bulk tissue transcriptomic analysis. Transcriptomic datasets of AD and AMD were obtained from the GEO database. The shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in control and AD- and AMD-affected samples were identified. Functional enrichment analysis for DEGs was subsequently performed. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these DEGs was established via the STRING database and hub genes of this network were identified by Cytoscape software. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed using Seurat R package to explore their expression in different cell types.ResultsDifferential analysis identified 127 shared DEGs of the two diseases, including 71 upregulated and 56 downregulated genes. Upregulated DEGs were enriched in inflammation, gliogenesis, cell apoptosis, and response to bacterial and viral infection and downregulated DEGs were enriched in mitochondrial function and energy production. PPI network and Cytoscape determined 10 hub genes, of which the NFKBIA gene was associated with the severity of both AD and AMD. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that NFKBIA was highly expressed in microglia from disease-affected tissues.ConclusionsThe findings indicated that microglia with high NFKBIA expression were important contributors to the progression of both AD and AMD. Microglia-derived NFKBIA might serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD and AMD.",J Alzheimers Dis
40021094,Antioxidants in anti-Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.,"Oxidative stress is widely recognized as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While not the sole factor, it is closely linked to critical pathological features, such as the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The development of agents with antioxidant properties has become an area of growing interest in AD research. Between 2015 and 2024, several antioxidant-targeted drugs for AD progressed to clinical trials, with increasing attention to the evaluation of antioxidant properties during their development. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in linking various AD hypotheses, underscoring its importance in understanding the disease mechanisms. Despite this, comprehensive reviews addressing advancements in AD drug development from the perspective of antioxidant capacity remain limited, hindering the design of novel compounds. This review aims to explore the mechanistic relationship between oxidative stress and AD, summarize methods for assessing antioxidant capacity, and provide an overview of antioxidant compounds with anti-AD properties reported over the past decade. The goal is to offer strategies for identifying effective antioxidant-based therapies for AD and to deepen our understanding of the role of oxidative stress in AD pathology.",Ageing Res Rev
40120948,Impact of diet and exercise on mitochondrial quality and mitophagy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, synaptic damage, and mitochondrial abnormalities in the brain, leading to the progressive loss of cognitive function and memory. In AD, emerging research suggests that lifestyle factors such as a healthy diet and regular exercise may play a significant role in delaying the onset and progression of the disease. Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, as they are responsible for producing the energy to cells, including neurons to maintain cognitive function. Our article elaborates on how mitochondrial quality and function decline with age and AD, leading to an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in ATP production. Decline in mitochondrial quality can impair cellular functions contributing to the development and progression of disease with the loss of neuronal functions in AD. This article also covered mitophagy, the process by which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are selectively removed from the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis. Impaired mitophagy has been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of AD. We also discussed the impact of impaired mitophagy implicated in AD, as the accumulation of damaged mitochondria can lead to increased oxidative stress. We expounded how dietary interventions and exercise can help to improve mitochondrial quality, and mitochondrial function and enhance mitophagy in AD. A diet rich in antioxidants, polyphenols, and mitochondria-targeted small molecules has been shown to enhance mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative stress, particularly in neurons with aged and mild cognitively impaired subjects and AD patients. Promoting a healthy lifestyle, mainly balanced diet and regular exercise that support mitochondrial health, in an individual can potentially delay the onset and progression of AD. In conclusion, a healthy diet and regular exercise play a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial quality and mitochondrial function, in turn, enhancing mitophagy and synaptic activities that delay AD in the elderly populations.",Ageing Res Rev
40150820,Lipidomic and sterolomic profiles of different brain regions in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Although increasing evidence suggests that disruptions in lipid metabolism are closely associated with the disease, the overall profile of lipid and sterol changes that occur in the brain during Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. In this study, we compared brain tissues extracted from 32-week-old male wild-type mice and 5×FAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice, which carry mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) genes. Using untargeted lipidomics and sterolomics techniques, we investigated the metabolic profiles of lipids, with a focus on sterols specifically, in three brain regions: cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Our results revealed significant alterations in various lipids, particularly in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, suggesting changes in energy levels in these regions. Further pathway analysis indicated notable disruptions in key metabolic processes, particularly those related to fatty acids and cell membrane components. Additionally, we observed decreased expression of 15 genes involved in lipid and sterol regulation. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into how imbalances in lipid and sterol metabolism may contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting potential metabolic pathways involved in the development of this debilitating disease.",Neural Regen Res
40166028,Sex-specific Associations of Gene Expression with Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology and Ante-mortem Cognitive Performance.,"The biological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women remain undefined. While previous case/control studies have identified sex-biased molecular pathways, the sex-specific relationships between gene expression and AD endophenotypes, particularly involving sex chromosomes, are underexplored. With bulk transcriptomic data across 3 brain regions from 767 decedents, we investigated sex-specific associations between gene expression and post-mortem β-amyloid and tau, as well as antemortem longitudinal cognition. Among 23,118 significant gene associations, 10% were sex-specific, with 73% of these identified in females and primarily associated with tau tangles and longitudinal cognition (90%). Notably, four X-linked genes, MCF2 , HDAC8 , FTX , and SLC10A3 , demonstrated significant sex differences in their associations with AD endophenotypes (i.e., significant sex x gene interaction). Our results also uncovered sex-specific biological pathways, including a female-specific role of neuroinflammation and neuronal development, underscoring the importance of sex-aware analyses to advance precision medicine approaches in AD.",Res Sq
40005159,The Role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor as an Essential Mediator in Neuronal Functions and the Therapeutic Potential of Its Mimetics for Neuroprotection in Neurologic and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Among neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4/5), BDNF has been extensively studied for its physiological role in cell survival and synaptic regulation in the central nervous system's (CNS's) neurons. BDNF binds to TrkB (a tyrosine kinase) with high affinity, and the resulting downstream intracellular signaling cascades play crucial roles in determining cell fate, including neuronal differentiation and maturation of the CNS neurons. It has been well demonstrated that the downregulation/dysregulation of the BDNF/TrkB system is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Interestingly, the effects of BDNF mimetic compounds including flavonoids, small molecules which can activate TrkB-mediated signaling, have been extensively investigated as potential therapeutic strategies for brain diseases, given that p75NTR, a common neurotrophin receptor, also contributes to cell death under a variety of pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration. Since the downregulation of the BDNF/TrkB system is associated with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, understanding how alterations in the BDNF/TrkB system contribute to disease progression could provide valuable insight for the prevention of these brain diseases. The present review shows recent advances in the molecular mechanisms underlying the BDNF/TrkB system in neuronal survival and plasticity, providing critical insights into the potential therapeutic impact of BDNF mimetics in the pathophysiology of brain diseases.",Molecules
40071886,Therapeutics for Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease in Unani Medicine.,"Alzheimer's disease refers to a neurological disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction caused by the death of brain cells. It is a progressive, devitalizing disease of aging that has skyrocketed in recent years. The disease progresses gradually, with symptoms including forgetfulness, difficulty with language or communication, disorientation, mood swings, and changes in behaviour. Unani medicine, being an older system of medicine, does not mention Alzheimer's disease as such since the name was coined only in 1907 AD. The Unani medical literature has, however, described the existence of Nisyān with signs and symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The renowned Unani scholars have not only mentioned the aetiology and pathogenesis of Nisyān but also designed a specific line of treatment. This study attempts to present the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and Nisyān, along with an exploration of potential treatment options available in Unani medicine.",Altern Ther Health Med
39999645,Social and contextual memory impairments induced by Amyloid-β oligomers are rescued by Sigma-1 receptor activation.,"Sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs) are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system and modulate neuron intracellular calcium levels, leading to changes in neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity. They also interact with various proteins and signaling pathways, playing a key role in regulating synaptic plasticity in brain areas such as the hippocampus, thereby influencing learning and memory processes. This opens a research avenue to explore S1R modulation as a potential therapeutic target in diseases involving hippocampal synaptic alterations and compromised cognitive processes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we hypothesize that pharmacological activation of S1R could counteract synaptic plasticity deficits and hippocampal-dependent cognitive alterations in an early-stage amyloidosis model of Alzheimer's disease, induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers (oAβ<sub>1-42</sub>). For that purpose, we investigate ex vivo CA3-CA1 synaptic plasticity, while in vivo, we performed open field habituation and social recognition tasks to assess contextual and social memory, respectively. Our data show that pharmacological activation of S1Rs with the selective agonist PRE-084 counteract oAβ<sub>1-42</sub> deleterious effects on CA3-CA1 long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP), and hippocampal-dependent contextual and social memory, without alterations of spontaneous behaviors. Together, these results provide further evidence for the role of S1Rs in ameliorating hippocampal synaptic and contextual memory dysfunctions and introduce novel insight into their involvement in early amyloid-induced social memory deficits, highlighting their potential for developing comprehensive treatments for early AD. Also, the absence of adverse behavioral outcomes associated with PRE-084 treatment suggests a favorable safety profile in preclinical models, supporting its potential as a therapeutic option.",Biomed Pharmacother
40149496,Clinical Significance of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Mutations in Asian and Western Populations: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Background: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is primarily inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes being central contributors. Diagnosing Alzheimer's poses challenges due to the coexistence of various co-pathologies, and treatment options remain limited for most patients, apart from familial cases linked to specific genetic mutations. While significant research on Alzheimer's genetics has been conducted in both Asian and Caucasian populations, the specific mutations and their clinical impacts in EOAD are still inadequately explored. This review aims to provide a detailed analysis of commonly reported genetic mutations and associated clinical features in EOAD patients from Asian and Western populations.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic database search was conducted for studies published between 2016 and 2023. After screening 491 records, 36 studies from Asian cohorts and 40 from Western cohorts met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed 127 unique mutations in the Asian population and 190 in the Western population. About 16.7% of Asian and 21.9% of Western studies covered both familial and sporadic AD, with consistent patterns across groups. Some mutations were shared between the populations and displayed similar clinical features, while others were population-specific.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the considerable variability in EOAD mutations and phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing in younger patients to enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment strategies effectively.",Genes (Basel)
40138103,"Plasma GFAP, NfL, and p-tau181 levels as early biomarkers of dementia in Chinese adults: Shenzhen community cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Although blood-based biomarkers can be used to detect early Alzheimer's disease (AD), population differences affect their clinical value in early diagnosis of the disease spectrum.
AIMS: To examine the potential of plasma biomarkers to detect different stages along the AD continuum in a Chinese population.
METHODS: We enrolled 113 adults from the Shenzhen community (53 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 45 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 15 with AD). We used the single-molecule array technique to detect the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), and phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181), and performed APOE genotyping. We assessed the association between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores, and used receiver operating characteristic curves to measure performance for early AD diagnosis.
RESULTS: The plasma GFAP, NfL, and p-tau181 levels increased significantly in AD and were slightly higher in MCI than in CU (GFAP p = 0.811, NfL p = 0.909, p-tau181 p = 0.696). The plasma GFAP and p-tau181 levels negatively correlated with cognitive scores. Blood markers demonstrated higher performance in identifying AD than CU or MCI. Plasma p-tau181 displayed the highest diagnostic value for AD. Predictions of cognitive impairment were more robust when blood markers were combined with clinical indicators for AD (age, sex, body mass index, years of education, and APOE ε4 carrier status).
DISCUSSION: The expression of plasma GFAP, NfL, and p-tau181 increased in the AD continuum. Importantly, plasma p-tau181 could identify individuals with AD from the general population, with superior predictive performance when combined with age or sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarkers are useful screening indicators for early AD in Chinese adults.",Aging Clin Exp Res
40156298,Plasma protein risk scores for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the Framingham heart study.,"INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether aggregated plasma protein risk scores (PPRSs) could be useful in predicting the risks of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: The Cox proportional hazard model with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator penalty was used to build the PPRSs for MCI and AD in 1515 Framingham Heart Study Generation 2 with 1128 proteins measured in plasma at exam 5 (cognitively normal [CN] = 1258, MCI = 129, AD = 128).
RESULTS: MCI PPRS had a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.97 [5.34, 9.12], with a discriminating power (C-index = 82.52%). AD PPRS had a HR of 5.74 [4.67, 7.05] (C-index = 88.15%). Both PPRSs were also significantly associated with cognitive changes, brain atrophy, and plasma AD biomarkers. Proteins in the MCI and AD PPRSs were involved in several pathways related to leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that PPRSs serve well to predict the risk of developing MCI and AD as well as cognitive changes and AD-related pathogenesis in the brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: PPRSs were developed for the risk of AD and AD preclinical stage, MCI. PPRSs were developed for MCI and AD associated with cognitive changes, loss of brain volume, and increasing level of plasma AD biomarkers. Leukocyte, chemotaxis, immunity, inflammation, and cellular migration enriched in proteins were identified as being involved in MCI and AD PPRSs.",Alzheimers Dement
40050115,Hippocampal neural stem cell exosomes promote brain resilience against the impact of tau oligomers.,"A promising therapeutic intervention for preventing the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is to protect and improve synaptic resilience, a well-established early vulnerability associated with the toxic effects of oligomers of Aβ (AβO) and Tau (TauO). We have previously reported that exosomes from hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) protect synapses against AβO. Here, we demonstrate how exosomes can also shield against TauO toxicity in adult mice synapses, potentially benefiting primary and secondary tauopathies. Exosomes from hippocampal NSCs (NSCexo) or mature neurons (MNexo) were delivered intracerebroventricularly to adult wildtype male mice (C57Bl6/J). After 24 hours, TauO were administered to suppress long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory, measured by electrophysiology and contextual memory deficits measured using novel object recognition (NOR) test. We also assessed TauO binding to synapses using isolated synaptosomes and cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, mimics of select miRNAs present in NSCexo, were delivered ICV to mice prior to assessment of TauO-induced suppression of hippocampal LTP. Our results showed that NSC-, not MN-, derived exosomes, prevented TauO-induced memory impairment, LTP suppression, and reduced Tau accumulation and TauO internalization in synaptosomes. These findings suggest that NSC-derived exosomes can protect against synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits induced by both AβO and TauO, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for multiple neurodegenerative states.Significance Statement NSCexo provide an unprecedented therapeutic strategy targeting an early vulnerability driven by amyloidogenic toxic oligomers associated with multiple neurodegenerative states.",J Neurosci
40164762,Impairment of theta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region may mediate age-dependent movement alternations in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Clinical evidences indicate that multifaceted gait abnormalities may manifest in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, which are associated with cognitive decline. Although the correlation between hippocampal theta power and locomotion has been known for a long time, the mechanisms by how hippocampal impairment participates in the altered gait seen in AD is not fully understood. To explore the manifestations of gait disorders in AD, we characterized gait performance in 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old male 5xFAD and control mice in the semi-automated, highly sensitive, Catwalk XT system. The 5xFAD mice displayed a decrease in kinetic parameters (average speed and cadence), and spatial parameters (paw area), while the temporal parameters (stance and swing time) were significantly increased. The parameters of interlimb coordination also displayed deficits. The majority of impairment variables related to the slow speed in 5xFAD mice at 9-month-old. We further explored the theta oscillations in the brain by in vivo tetrode recording of the hippocampal CA1. The results showed that the theta oscillations reduced in the hippocampal CA1 of 5xFAD mice, which related to the gait impairments. In conclusion, gait impairments started at 6 months of age, manifested at 9 months of age in 5xFAD mice. A reduction in theta oscillation power of the hippocampal CA1 may be responsible for the gait impairments.",Sci Rep

40145977,Potential targets of microglia in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases: mechanism and therapeutic implications.,"For diverse neurodegenerative disorders, microglial cells are activated. Furthermore, dysfunctional and hyperactivated microglia initiate mitochondrial autophagy, oxidative stress, and pathological protein accumulation, ending with neuroinflammation that exacerbates damage to dopaminergic neurons and contributes significantly to the pathology of neurodegenerative disorder. Microglial overactivation is closely associated with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the phagocytosis of injured neurons, and the modulation of neurotoxic environments. This review summarizes the role of microglia neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, cortical degeneration, Lewy body dementia, and Huntington's disease. It also discusses novel forms of cell death such as ferroptosis, cuproptosis, disulfidptosis, and parthanatos (poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase 1-dependent cell death), as well as the impact of regulatory factors related to microglial inflammation on microglial activation and neuroinflammation.

40013172,Atypical Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease in a Young Female: A Case Report.,"Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles at an earlier age. It affects multiple cognitive domains, including memory, executive function, and motor abilities. Here, we present a case of atypical early-onset AD. A 33-year-old woman with no significant medical history experienced a two-year decline in cognitive function, resulting in job loss and incidents such as cooking-related fires. Neurological examination revealed impaired attention, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and a dystaxic gait. Imaging and tests showed minor abnormalities, with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, autoimmune, and metabolic workups. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scans indicated cortical atrophy and parietal hypometabolism. The patient was referred to a memory center for further evaluation and potential treatment with lecanemab. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing early-onset neurodegenerative disorders, which can present atypically and mimic other conditions. The extensive diagnostic workup emphasizes the difficulty of diagnosing these disorders, particularly in the absence of specific biomarkers. Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders in young adults requires heightened clinical suspicion and a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including advanced brain imaging, such as MRI and PET scans, to ensure timely diagnosis and referral to specialized centers.",Cureus

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma biomarkers from 197 participants in the BIODEGMAR cohort (Hospital del Mar, Barcelona) were analyzed. Participants were classified based on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers. We assessed the ability of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, t-tau, and Aβ42/40 to classify Aβ pathology status.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers had a greater diagnostic performance and larger effect sizes compared to t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Aβ pathology. Among them, plasma p-tau217 consistently outperformed the others, demonstrating superior area under the curves. Furthermore, p-tau217 showed the strongest correlation between plasma and CSF levels, underscoring its potential as a reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: Several plasma biomarkers, targeting different epitopes and using different platforms, demonstrated high performance in detecting AD in a memory clinic setting.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers demonstrated higher diagnostic performance and larger effect sizes than t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Alzheimer's disease. Among the p-tau biomarkers, p-tau217 assays consistently outperformed the others, providing superior classification of Aβ pathology status across different phosphorylation sites. p-tau217 assays showed the strongest correlation between plasma and CSF levels, indicating its potential as a reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers.

40150709,Investigating Connectivity Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease Using a Novel 3D Bioprinted Model Designed to Quantify Neurite Outgrowth.,"Here, we present a novel 3D bioprinted model of the forebrain cortex designed to quantify neurite outgrowth across a hydrogel bridge. To validate this model, we cultured Alzheimer's disease (AD) forebrain cortical populations derived from human iPSCs carrying APP (amyloid precursor protein) mutations (K670M/N671L + V717F). Neurite and synapse formation were significantly impaired in 3D AD mutant cultures compared to controls, but this was not replicated in 2D, highlighting deficits in these traditional 2D cell culture models. To investigate the mechanisms underlying impaired neurite outgrowth in 3D and 2D models of AD, we assessed amyloid-β dysfunction, mitochondrial health, and oxidative stress in both conditions. In the 3D model, APP mutant cultures exhibited reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and fragmented networks, indicating dysfunction and potential cellular energy deficits. Additionally, elevated oxidative stress and proteostasis disruption were identified in the 3D AD models as indicators of cellular damage, which may be limiting neurite extension. Furthermore, transcriptomic (bulk RNA-Seq) analysis revealed distinct differences in gene expression pathways between 2D and 3D models of AD, suggesting alternate underlying mechanisms of disease pathology between the culture conditions. This study demonstrates the functionality of this novel 3D bioprinted model for quantifying neurite connectivity and identifying underlying disease mechanisms.",Bioengineering (Basel)
40042046,Metabolic Reprogramming in Primary Microglial Cell and Extracellular Vesicle Triggered by Aβ Exposure.,"Microglia, key immune cells in the brain, play a pivotal role in brain homeostasis and immune responses. Emerging evidence suggests their critical involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and propagation. The propagation of AD pathology is related to the extracellular matrix of microglia, including extracellular vesicles (EV). Recently, microglia-derived EVs are implicated in inflammatory processes and neuronal death. This study aimed to extensively profile and propose the metabolic role of microglial EVs in AD. Accordingly, we determined the significant alterations of the EV metabolome associated with the metabolites in primary microglial cells. Aβ exposure induced significant metabolic alteration of 39, 18, and 28 metabolites in microglial cells, cultured media, and EVs, respectively. Aβ exposure triggered common alteration of key metabolic pathways between microglial cells and EVs, including purine, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolisms. While most of the common metabolites showed the same directional changes among the microglial system, N-acetyl aspartic acid displayed the opposite directional change in EVs. N-acetyl aspartic acid decreased 2.3-fold and twofold in microglial cells and media, respectively, but increased 3.5-fold in EVs under Aβ exposure. Moreover, mediation analysis proposed key EV metabolites that were directly affected by the metabolic dysregulation of Aβ-exposed microglial cells. The up-regulation of cysteic acid in EVs was mediated by up-regulated IMP in microglial cells. The down-regulation of 1-16:0-lysoPE in EVs was mediated by stearoyl-L-carnitine in microglial cells. Our study sheds new light on the role of microglia and EVs in neurodegenerative diseases, offering promising avenues for future therapeutic interventions.",J Neurochem
40114073,The role of a specialized memory clinic supporting primary care providers in a safety net health system.,"BACKGROUND: Although most dementia care occurs in primary care, consultation with dementia specialty care is sometimes indicated. Access to dementia specialists is limited, particularly in resource-limited environments such as the public health safety net, which may require triaging referrals to preserve access for patients with needs that can not be met in a primary care setting.
METHODS: The eConsult system for primary care providers to refer patients to a subspecialty memory clinic is described for a large safety net health system. Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented for patients evaluated within the memory clinic setting compared to the health system overall. ICD-10-CM codes were used to identify cognitive diagnoses and medical comorbidities. Chi-squared tests were used to compare categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.
RESULTS: 94 individuals age 50 or older were seen in the memory clinic in 2019, of whom 43 were new evaluations. The most common visit diagnoses for new memory clinic patients were Alzheimer's disease (33%), no cognitive diagnosis (28%), unspecified dementia (19%), and mild cognitive impairment (12%); for follow up patients, the most common diagnoses were Alzheimer's disease (49%), unspecified dementia (18%), no cognitive diagnosis (14%), and mild cognitive impairment (10%). For those without a cognitive diagnosis, common visit diagnoses included cognitive symptoms, mood or sleep disorders, and metabolic disturbances. Of the 11 new internal referrals with a prior coded diagnosis of dementia, median time from first diagnosis to their initial memory clinic visit was 224 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite clear systemwide parameters for referral and extensive pre-referral screening via an eConsult system, the most common diagnosis for memory clinic patients was Alzheimer's disease. Direct studies of eConsult are needed to determine primary care providers' needs when referring patients with dementia to a memory clinic setting.",BMC Prim Care
40034512,"The relationship between levels of physical activity, adherence to the MIND diet, and cognitive impairment in adults aged 65 years or older in Pakistan.","BACKGROUND: In contrast to existing evidence focusing on high-income countries, this study offers novel insights into the demographic and geographical context that have yet to be explored in the existing literature. Comparatively, in Pakistan, cognitive impairment is one of the neglected disorders that can develop into dementia and Alzheimer's disease. As no treatment is available, lifestyle modifications are a valid intervention for cognitive health.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the relationship between physical functionality, adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurological Delay (MIND), and cognitive impairment among elderly individuals in Pakistan.
METHODS: From January to June 2023, this cross-sectional study recruited 462 participants aged 65 and above. We used proven tools in gerontological research, such as the MIND diet quiz and Quick Physical Activity Rating scale (QPAR), to evaluate diet and physical activity levels. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 26.40% of the participants had mild cognitive impairment, whereas 48.50% demonstrated low adherence to the MIND diet. The mean QPAR score was 20.51 ± 18.77. A significant association was found between lower physical activity levels and increased cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratio 9.94, confidence interval (CI): 6.07-16.27). Additionally, higher adherence to the MIND diet correlated with reduced cognitive impairment (odds ratio 0.29, CI: 0.18-0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the critical role of diet and physical activity in cognitive health among the elderly population. The study emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions and further longitudinal research to explore the long-term effects of these factors on cognitive health.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

However, the cost-effectiveness and operational complexity of method using blood-based biomarkers significantly limit its availability in clinical practice.
METHODS: We developed low-cost, convenient machine learning-based with digital biomarkers (MLDB) using plasma spectra data to detect AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls (HCs) and discriminate AD from different types of neurodegenerative diseases. Retrospective data were gathered for 1324 individuals, including 293 with amyloid beta positive AD, 151 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 106 with Lewy body dementia (DLB), 106 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 135 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 533 healthy controls (HCs) between July 2017 and August 2023.
FINDINGS: Random forest classifier and feature selection procedures were used to select digital biomarkers. MLDB achieved area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.92 (AD vs. HC, Sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 84.1%), 0.89 (MCI vs. HC, Sensitivity 88.8%, specificity 86.4%), 0.83 (AD vs. DLB, Sensitivity 77.2%, specificity 74.6%), 0.80 (AD vs. FTD, sensitivity 74.2%, specificity 72.4%), and 0.93 (AD vs. PSP, sensitivity 76.1%, specificity 75.7%). Digital biomarkers distinguishing AD from HC were negatively correlated with plasma p-tau217 (r = -0.22, p &lt; 0.05) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (r = -0.09, p &lt; 0.05).

40042435,Considerations in the clinical use of amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are now established tools in the diagnostic workup of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their use is anticipated to increase with the introduction of new disease-modifying therapies. Although these biomarkers are comparable alternatives in research settings to determine Aβ status, biomarker testing in clinical practice requires careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of each modality, as well as the specific clinical context, to identify which test is best suited for each patient. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathologic processes reflected by Aβ-PET and CSF biomarkers, their performance, and their current and future applications and contexts of use. The primary aim is to assist clinicians in making better-informed decisions about the suitability of each biomarker in different clinical situations, thereby reducing the risk of misdiagnosis or incorrect interpretation of biomarker results.

40073521,Relatively independent and complementary roles of family history and polygenic risk score in age at onset and incident cases of 12 common diseases.,"Few studies have systematically compared the overlap and complementarity of family history (FH) and polygenic risk score (PRS) in terms of disease risk. We here investigated the impacts of FH and PRS on the risk of incident diseases or age at disease onset, as well as their clinical value in risk prediction. We analyzed 12 diseases in the prospective cohort study of UK Biobank (N = 461,220). First, restricted mean survival time analysis was performed to evaluate the influences of FH and PRS on age at onset. Then, Cox proportional hazards model was employed to estimate the effects of FH and PRS on the incident risk. Finally, prediction models were constructed to examine the clinical value of FH and PRS in the incident disease risk. Compared to negative FH, positive FH led to an earlier onset, with an average of 2.29 years earlier between the top and bottom 2.5% PRSs and high blood pressure showing the greatest difference of 6.01 years earlier. Both FH and PRS were related to higher incident risk; but they only exhibited weak interactions on high blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease/dementia, and provided relatively independent and partially complementary information on disease susceptibility, with PRS explaining 7.0% of the FH effect but FH accounting for only 1.1% of the PRS effect for incident cases. Further, FH and PRS showed additional predictive value in risk evaluation, with breast cancer showing the greatest improvement (31.3%). FH and PRS significantly affect a variety of diseases, and they are not interchangeable measures of genetic susceptibility, but instead offer largely independent and partially complementary information. Incorporating FH, PRS, and clinical risk factors simultaneously leads to the greatest predictive value for disease risk assessment.",Soc Sci Med
40039841,A deep spatio-temporal attention model of dynamic functional network connectivity shows sensitivity to Alzheimer's in asymptomatic individuals.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses from asymptomatic changes to clinical symptoms, emphasizing the importance of early detection for proper treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), particularly dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC), has emerged as an important biomarker for AD. Nevertheless, studies probing at-risk subjects in the pre-symptomatic stage using dFNC are limited. To identify at-risk subjects and understand alterations of dFNC in different stages, we leverage deep learning advancements and introduce a transformer-convolution framework for predicting at-risk subjects based on dFNC, incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention to capture brain network dependencies and temporal dynamics. Our model significantly outperforms other popular machine learning methods. By analyzing individuals with diagnosed AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we studied the AD progression and observed a higher similarity between MCI and asymptomatic AD. The interpretable analysis highlights the cognitive-control network's diagnostic importance, with the model focusing on intra-visual domain dFNC when predicting asymptomatic AD subjects.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40092368,Uncovering atrophy progression pattern and mechanisms in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is associated with pre-symptomatic changes in brain morphometry and accumulation of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta pathology. Studying the development of brain changes prior to symptoms onset may lead to early diagnostic biomarkers and a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Alzheimer's disease pathology is thought to arise from a combination of protein accumulation and spreading via neural connections, but how these processes influence brain atrophy progression in the pre-symptomatic phases remains unclear. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (FHAD) have an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease, providing an opportunity to study the pre-symptomatic phase. Here, we used structural MRI from three databases (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer Disease and Montreal Adult Lifespan Study) to map atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease and assess the constraining effects of structural connectivity on atrophy progression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data up to 4 years were used to perform atrophy progression analysis in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. PET radiotracers were also used to quantify the distribution of abnormal tau and amyloid-beta protein isoforms at baseline. We first derived cortical atrophy progression maps using deformation-based morphometry from 153 FHAD, 156 Alzheimer's disease and 116 controls with similar age, education and sex at baseline. We next examined the spatial relationship between atrophy progression and spatial patterns of tau aggregates and amyloid-beta plaques deposition, structural connectivity and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. Our results show that there were similar patterns of atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease, notably in the cingulate, temporal and parietal cortices, with more widespread and severe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. Both tau and amyloid-beta pathology tended to accumulate in regions that were structurally connected in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease. The pattern of atrophy and its progression also aligned with existing structural connectivity in FHAD. In Alzheimer's disease, our findings suggest that atrophy progression results from pathology propagation that occurred earlier, on a previously intact connectome. Moreover, a relationship was found between serotonin receptor spatial distribution and atrophy progression in Alzheimer's disease. The current study demonstrates that regions showing atrophy progression in FHAD and Alzheimer's disease present with specific connectivity and cellular characteristics, uncovering some of the mechanisms involved in pre-clinical and clinical neurodegeneration.",Brain Commun
40065151,UK Biobank data demonstrate long-term exposure to floods is a risk factor for incident dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Flooding has emerged as the most prevalent natural disaster, impacting billions of individuals worldwide. However, the long-term effects of flooding exposure on dementia remain unclear.
METHODS: With a nested case-control design, a risk-set sampling method was used to match cases and controls. Annual cumulative flooding exposure was calculated for each participant. The associations between flooding exposure and incident dementia were assessed using conditional logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Here we show that the risk of flood-related incident dementia is the strongest in the current year and diminished over a span of 6 years. In the fully adjusted model, the cumulative odds ratios (OR) are 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.31) for any dementia, 1.44 (95% CI: 1.36-1.53) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.48-1.83) for vascular dementia, associated with per unit increase in annual cumulative flooding exposure over lag 0-6 years. Participants under the age of 65 years (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.33-1.46) and female participants (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.33-1.49) exhibit a higher risk of incident dementia compared to those aged 65 years and older (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.21-1.28) and male participants (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.23-1.30), respectively. Similar effect estimates are observed in the stratified analyses of Alzheimer's disease according to genetic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides robust epidemiological evidence supporting the link between floods and an increased risk of dementia. These findings enhance the understanding of the long-term consequences of flood exposure.",Commun Med (Lond)
39987285,Glucose Metabolic Reprogramming in Microglia: Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Targeted Therapy.,"As intrinsic immune cells in the central nervous system, microglia play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Microglia can transition from homeostasis to various responsive states in reaction to different external stimuli, undergoing corresponding alterations in glucose metabolism. In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), microglial glucose metabolic reprogramming is widespread. This reprogramming leads to changes in microglial function, exacerbating neuroinflammation and the accumulation of pathological products, thereby driving the progression of neurodegeneration. This review summarizes the specific alterations in glucose metabolism within microglia in AD, PD, ALS, and MS, as well as the corresponding treatments aimed at reprogramming glucose metabolism. Compounds that inhibit key glycolytic enzymes like hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), or activate regulators of energy metabolism such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), have shown significant potential in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, current research faces numerous challenges, including side effects and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of compounds. Screening relevant drugs from natural products, especially flavonoids, is a reliable approach. On the one hand, longtime herbal medical practices provide a certain degree of assurance regarding clinical safety, and their chemical properties contribute to effective BBB permeability. On the other hand, the concurrent anti-tumor and anti-neuroinflammatory activities of flavonoids suggest that regulation of glucose metabolism reprogramming might be a potential common mechanism of action. Notably, considering the dynamic nature of microglial metabolism, there is an urgent need to develop technologies for real-time monitoring of glucose metabolism processes, which would significantly advance research in this field.",Mol Neurobiol
40117242,Exploration of small molecules as inhibitors of potential BACE1 protein to treat amyloid cerebrovascular disease by employing molecular modeling and simulation approaches.,"Amyloid cerebrovascular disease, primarily driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, is intricately linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) plays a critical role in the production of Aβ, making it a key therapeutic target. In the current work, a CNS library of ChemDiv database containing 44085 compounds was screened against the BACE1 protein. Initially, a structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis was constructed, followed by virtual screening, with the screened hits docked to the BACE1 protein to determine the optimal binding modes. The docking results were examined using the glide gscore and chemical interactions of the docked molecules. The cutoff value of -5 kcal/mol was used to select hits with high binding affinities. A total of seven hits were chosen based on the glide g score. Furthermore, the possible binding mechanisms of the docked ligands were investigated, and it was discovered that all seven selected ligands occupied the same site in the predicted binding pocket of protein. The bioactivity scores of the compounds demonstrated that the chosen compounds possess the features of lead compounds. The toxicity risks and ADMET features of the selected hits were anticipated, and four compounds, J032-0080, SC13-0774, V030-0915, and V006-5608 were chosen for stability analysis. The selected hits were extremely stable and strongly bound to the BACE1 pocket, and conformational changes caused by RMSD, RMSF, and protein-ligand interactions were assessed using MD modeling. Similarly, principal component analysis revealed a large static number of hydrogen bonds. The MM/GBSA binding free energies maps revealed a significant energy contribution in the binding of selected hits to BACE1. The binding free energy landscapes indicated that the hits were bound with a high binding affinity. Thus, the hits could serve as lead compounds in biophysical investigations to limit the biological activity of the BACE1 protein.",PLoS One
40140976,Shapeshifter W-Tau Peptide Inhibits Tau Aggregation and Disintegrates Paired Helical Filaments.,"Tauopathies comprise a range of neurodegenerative conditions characterized by the aberrant accumulation of tau protein clumps in the brain. These aggregates are formed by different tau splicing isoforms. Here, we analyzed the role of a specific intron-derived peptide called the W-Tau peptide on the polymerization-depolymerization of tau filaments. This peptide originates from a new isoform of the tau protein, named W-Tau, which is formed due to the retention of intron 12. AlphaFold3 (AF3)-based in silico investigations suggested that the W-Tau peptide interacts with tau monomers. Our in vitro experiments confirmed these predictions and showed that the W-Tau peptide inhibited tau aggregation. In addition, the W-Tau peptide disrupted preexisting paired helical filaments (PHFs) isolated from postmortem brain samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease, thereby supporting its potential therapeutic value. The effectiveness of the W-Tau peptide was demonstrated by the decrease in tau aggregation observed after cotransfection of the W-Tau peptide and PHF seeds, as demonstrated by analysis involving a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) cell biosensor. The W-Tau peptide breaks PHFs by selectively attaching to their ends, causing the structures to unwind and convert into circle-like formations. Considering the potential neuroprotective effects against tauopathies, the W-Tau isoform and its peptide are interesting candidates for future therapeutic interventions.",Biochemistry
40107930,Cohen-mansfield agitation inventory total score as a measure of agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's disease: A factor analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often associated with agitation and aggression, which may impair function, impede care, and be a major source of stress for caregivers. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is often used to assess agitation and aggression. In its original, nursing-home version, it is a 29-item, caregiver-informed, clinician-administered 7-point scale that assesses the frequency of various agitation or aggressive behaviors. However, the instruction manual advises against the use of the total score in favor of a domain-based analysis. This recommendation has been followed in both clinical trials and practice. Because the CMAI is comprehensive and easy to administer, we sought to determine the validity of its total score as a single construct for assessing agitation and aggression in patients with AD.
METHODS: We used a previously conducted factor analysis of the CMAI scores from two risperidone trials in patients with dementia (N = 648), and a follow-up analysis of the subset of patients with psychosis of AD (N = 479), to examine, using vector analysis and an effect-size-versus-signal-to-noise ratio analysis, whether the total CMAI score could confidently be used as a global measure of agitation and aggression in AD.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that the CMAI items from the dataset analyzed load into 4 clusters, which cover about 50 % of the total data variance. Surprisingly, items with the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (hitting, performing repetitious mannerisms, aimless pacing or wandering) had the strongest response to treatment (and vice versa), and belonged to different factors. The further observation that many items were spread among the factors, instead of primarily measuring a single factor or domain, suggests that there is a continuum of symptoms, and separating them into domains requires separating very similar items that measure two or more domains.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that assessing agitation and aggression via CMAI domains instead of the total score is likely to miss important behavioral signals. Using total CMAI score in clinical trials and practice, along with the assessment of individual items, is warranted.",Int Psychogeriatr
40034357,Investigation of the effect of green walking and intelligence games on the cognitive skills of individuals between the ages of 50-70 survived COVID-19 disease: A randomized controlled study.,"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment can be considered as the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. With the addition of COVID-19 disease to the cognitive decline that occurs with aging, it may cause dementia with severe cognitive losses such as Alzheimer's disease in some people. Physical activity and brain-occupying practices can significantly improve the risk factors for cognitive disorders and Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of study was to examine the effect of green walking and intelligence game on the cognitive skills of individuals aged 50-70 years with COVID-19.
METHODS: The randomized controlled study was completed with 40 individuals, 20 in the experimental and 20 in the control group. Individuals in the experimental group green walking for 30 min three days a week for one month in two groups of 10 people, accompanied by the researcher. In addition, these individuals played intelligence games (brain games-memory thinking and brain exercise) via their smartphones for 15 min every day for a month.
RESULTS: The cognitive skills and cognitive dimensions of ""attention, concentration, memory, language and orientation"" of the individuals in the experimental group were significantly increased compared to the control group individuals (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that green walk and intelligence game practice increased the cognitive skills of individuals aged 50-70 years who had outpatient COVID-19.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40139278,Influence of WWOX/MAF genes on cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Beyond its hallmark motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) encompasses a range of non-motor disturbances, particularly cognitive impairment, which significantly affects patients' quality of life. Cognitive impairment is a shared manifest in both PD and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Existing literature has identified the WWOX/MAF genes as potential risk factors for AD, but their role in cognitive functions among PD remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study examines the influence of AD-associated risk genes, specifically WWOX/MAF, on cognitive function in PD, aiming to bridge the neuropathological gap between AD and PD.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 402 participants were included in this study, comprising 150 individuals with PD and 252 healthy controls (HC).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and genotyping. A moderation regression model was employed to assess the impact of WWOX/MAF single nucleotide polymorphisms on cognitive function and the potential modulatory effect of PD.
RESULTS: The WWOX gene was found to influence verbal fluency performance across the entire cohort. Additionally, PD significantly moderated the effect of genetic variants on attention (p = 0.000040), non-verbal memory (p = 0.000007), and visuospatial function (p = 0.000303), suggesting a distinct impact within this group. Further analysis indicated that cognitive status moderated the effect of genetic variants on verbal memory across the entire cohort (p < 0.001). Among individuals with PD, genetic variants also influenced verbal fluency (p = 0.000113) and verbal memory (p = 0.000440 and p = 0.000032).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the critical role of WWOX/MAF genes in cognitive impairments associated with PD, enhancing our understanding of their connection to AD and providing deeper insights into neurodegenerative disease progression.",Neurobiol Dis
40166719,Successful Guselkumab Treatment in a Patient with Comorbid Psoriasis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Case Study and Literature Review.,"Psoriasis is genetically influenced and can be triggered by factors such as infections, stress, and lifestyle. Chronic plaque psoriasis, the most prevalent form, involves key roles for IL-17 and IL-23 in its pathogenesis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy. Currently, there is no cure for ALS, and treatment is symptomatic, aimed at improving quality of life. The combination of psoriasis and ALS is relatively rare. Although biologic agents have shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, we have not found any case reports regarding the use of biologic agents for treating psoriasis accompanied by ALS. Our study presents a patient with severe plaque psoriasis and ALS who exhibited a positive response to Guselkumab, without worsening of ALS symptoms, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy. This could provide a treatment option for patients with psoriasis combined with ALS.We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the comorbidity of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and ALS, with plaque psoriasis. This review highlights the differential impact of treatment modalities. Specifically, we found that TNF-α inhibitors may have adverse effects in MS but could provide protective benefits in AD and PD. In ALS patients with psoriasis, IL-17A and IL-23 inhibitors, exemplified by Guselkumab, are suggested as a more suitable alternative due to their lower risk of worsening ALS symptoms.",Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol
40135197,(-)-Epicatechin Rescues Memory Deficits by Activation of Autophagy in a Mouse Model of Tauopathies.,"In tauopathies, defects in autophagy-lysosomal protein degradation are thought to contribute to the abnormal accumulation of aggregated tau. Recent studies have shown that (-)-Epicatechin (Epi), a dietary flavonoid belonging to the flavan-3-ol subgroup, improves blood flow, modulates metabolic profiles, and prevents oxidative damage. However, less research has explored the effects of Epi on tauopathies. Here, we found that Epi rescued cognitive deficits in P301S tau transgenic mice, a model exhibiting characteristics of tauopathies like frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and attenuated tau pathology through autophagy activation. Proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed that P301S mice exhibit deficits in autophagosome formation via modulating mTOR, consequently inhibiting autophagy. Epi inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway to promote autophagosome formation, which is essential for the clearance of tau aggregation. By using chloroquine (CQ) to inhibit autophagy in vivo, we further confirmed that Epi induced tau degradation via the autophagy pathway. Lastly, Epi administration was also found to improve cognition by reversing spine decrease and neuron loss, as well as attenuating neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that Epi promoted tau clearance by activating autophagy, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for tauopathies.",MedComm (2020)
40036035,Hospice Use Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Parkinson Disease and Dementia With Lewy Bodies.,"IMPORTANCE: Neurodegenerative disorders are now the most common reason that Medicare beneficiaries enroll in hospice for end-of-life care. People with all-cause dementia have high rates of suboptimal hospice use, but little is known about hospice use patterns in Lewy body disease, which includes both Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
OBJECTIVE: To compare patient characteristics, hospice agency characteristics, and patterns of use for beneficiaries with PD and DLB vs Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study including a 100% sample of national 2010-2020 calendar year Medicare data on hospice enrollees was performed. Data analysis was conducted from November 2023 to May 2024.
EXPOSURES: A diagnosis of PD or DLB, compared with AD as the reference group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of enrollees with short stays (<7 days), proportion with long stays (>180 days), proportion disenrolled for any reason before death, and disenrollment by type.
RESULTS: Of 11 327 324 Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in hospice between 2010 and 2020 who met eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age, 85.2 [7.5] years; 781 763 [63.0%] female), there were 958 182 (8.4%) with a primary diagnosis of AD, 232 864 (2.1%) with PD, and 49 340 (0.4%) with DLB. People with PD were more likely to experience a long stay (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16) compared with AD, whereas the odds for those with DLB were not increased. However, people with either PD or DLB were less likely to be disenrolled for extended prognosis compared with AD (OR for DLB, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85; OR for PD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88). People with PD were more likely to revoke hospice (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27-1.32) compared with AD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries, hospice use patterns differed by dementia subtype. Higher likelihood of hospice revocation in PD raises important questions about unmet needs and highlights the need for more research around the experience of the end of life in this growing population.",JAMA Netw Open
40063697,Correlating hippocampal and amygdala volumes with neuropathological burden in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative pathologies using 7T postmortem MRI.,"Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), is common in elderly brains and often seen in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). LATE-NC typically begins in the amygdala and spreads to the hippocampus and neocortex. Whether it contributes to hippocampal and amygdala atrophy in Down syndrome (DS) remains unexplored. We analyzed amygdala and hippocampal volumes and neuropathological burden in 12 DS cases and 54 non-DS cases with AD and related neurodegenerative pathologies (ADRNP) using 7 Tesla (7T) postmortem ex vivo MRI. Postmortem and antemortem hippocampal volumes were significantly correlated in a subset of 17 cases with available antemortem MRI scans. DS cases had smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes than ADRNP cases; these correlated with more severe Braak stage but not with Thal phase. LATE-NC and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) were uncommon in DS cases. In ADRNP cases, lower hippocampal volumes associated with dementia duration, advanced Thal phase, Braak NFT stage, C score, LATE-NC stage, HS and arteriolosclerosis severity; reduced amygdala volumes correlated with severe LATE-NC stage, HS, and arteriolosclerosis severity, but not with Thal phase or Braak NFT stage. Lewy body pathology did not affect hippocampal or amygdala volume in either cohort. Thus, hippocampal volumes in ADRNP were influenced by both ADNC and LATE-NC, and amygdala volumes were primarily influenced by LATE-NC. In DS, hippocampal and amygdala volumes were primarily influenced by tau pathology.",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol
40034511,Alzheimer's disease classification by supervised and intelligent techniques.,"BACKGROUND: Significant advancements in neuroimaging have emerged over the past decade, notably through positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Combining imaging modalities with machine learning (ML) techniques enhances diagnostic accuracy.
OBJECTIVE: To develop predictive models using pre-treatment brain imaging data to distinguish between normal controls (NC), MCI, and AD stages, improving diagnostic precision.
METHODS: We utilized the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, processing 3D MRI, PET Florbetaben, and PET Flortaucipir images. Techniques included convolutional neural networks (CNN), fuzzy logic, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Feature extraction involved amyloid-β volume, tau protein levels, and empty space volumes.
RESULTS: The fuzzy logic approach achieved a classification accuracy of 99.1%, outperforming CNN (90.67%) and MLP (94%). Integration of multimodal data significantly enhanced performance compared to single-modality approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that integrating advanced ML techniques with multimodal neuroimaging can effectively classify AD stages. These findings address critical gaps in early detection and provide a foundation for future clinical applications.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40157722,An improved method for sampling and quantitative protein analytics of cerebrospinal fluid of individual mice.,"The mouse is the species most commonly used in preclinical research, but protein analytics of murine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains challenging because of low sample volumes (often <10 μl) and frequent contaminations with blood. We developed an improved CSF sampling method that allows routine collection of larger volumes (20-30 μl) of pure CSF from individual mice, enabling multiple protein analytical assays from a single sample. Based on cell counts and hemoglobin ELISAs, we provide an easy quality control workflow for obtaining cell- and blood-free murine CSF. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics using an absolutely quantified external standard, we estimated concentrations for hundreds of mouse CSF proteins. While repeated CSF sampling from the same mouse was possible, it induced CSF proteome changes. Applying the improved method, we found that the mouse CSF proteome remains largely stable over time in wild-type mice, but that amyloid pathology in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease massively changes the CSF proteome. Neurofilament light chain and TREM2, markers of neurodegeneration and activated microglia, respectively, were strongly upregulated and validated using immunoassays. In conclusion, our refined murine CSF collection method overcomes previous limitations, allowing multiple quantitative protein analyses for applications in biomedicine.",Mol Cell Proteomics
40024078,A near-infrared fluorescent probe for the detection of mitochondrial viscosity and its application in the imaging of Alzheimer's disease mice brain.,"Viscosity is an important part of the cell microenvironment. Abnormal viscosity in the microenvironment is related to many diseases such as tumors, fatty liver and Alzheimer's disease. Accumulated β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils and plaques are key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, which can lead to severe neurotoxicity and cognitive and behavioral disorders. In this work, a near-infrared fluorescent probe (G) based on anthraquinone-quinolinium dye was constructed to detect viscosity. When the viscosity of the medium is high, the free rotation of the single bond is suppressed and the fluorescence intensity is enhanced. The probe shows high selectivity for viscosity. It is worth noting that probe G has a long excitation wavelength (640 nm) and emission wavelength (825 nm) with a large Stocks shift of 185 nm. At the same time, probe G is a positively charged molecule that can target mitochondria. In addition, probe G can be not only used to detect the viscosity of Aβ protein in vitro, but also image the abnormal viscosity of Aβ protein in the brain of Alzheimer's disease mice.",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc
40133608,Longitudinal excitation-inhibition balance altered by sex and APOE-ε4.,"Neuronal hyperexcitation affects memory and neural processing across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive continuum. Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic, shows promise in improving cognitive impairment by restoring the neural excitation/inhibition balance in AD patients. We previously identified a hyper-excitable phenotype in cognitively unimpaired female APOE-ε4 carriers relative to male counterparts cross-sectionally. This sex difference lacks longitudinal validation; however, clarifying the vulnerability of female ε4-carriers could better inform antiepileptic treatment efficacy. Here, we investigated this sex-by-ε4 interaction using a longitudinal design. We used resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging collected longitudinally from 106 participants who were cognitively unimpaired for at least one scan event but may have been assessed to have clinical dementia ratings corresponding to early mild cognitive impairment over time. By including scan events where participants transitioned to mild cognitive impairment, we modeled the trajectory of the whole-brain excitation-inhibition ratio throughout the preclinical cognitively healthy continuum and extended to early impairment. A linear mixed model revealed a significant three-way interaction among sex, ε4-status, and time, with female ε4-carriers showing a significant hyper-excitable trajectory. These findings suggest a possible pathway for preventative therapy targeting preclinical hyperexcitation in female ε4-carriers.",Commun Biol
40121009,Psychiatric morbidity in people with autoimmune arthritides as a model of inflammatory mechanisms in mental disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are autoimmune illnesses characterised by chronic inflammation demonstrating differential associations with psychiatric conditions.
OBJECTIVE: In this matched-cohort study, we aimed to investigate whether the associations between these inflammatory illnesses and mental disorders are predominantly the consequence of the burden of the former or whether common causes might underpin the susceptibility to both.
METHODS: Using Czech national inpatient care data, we identified individuals with RA or axSpA during the years 1999-2012. We investigated the occurrence of psychiatric outcomes up to 2017 using stratified Cox proportional hazards models. In evidence triangulation, we assessed the potential moderation by age at inflammatory illness, the associations relative to counterparts with other similarly burdensome chronic illnesses and the temporal ordering of conditions.
FINDINGS: Both RA and axSpA were associated with mood and anxiety disorders and behavioural syndromes. In evidence triangulation, the associations with depression showed a decreasing age-at-inflammatory-illness gradient in RA; the association between RA and depression was stronger than that between other chronic illnesses and depression; and excluding prevalent depression attenuated the RA-depression association. RA showed consistent inverse associations with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Common aetiologies might be involved in increasing the risk of developing both RA and depression. The consistent inverse associations between RA and schizophrenia and between RA and Alzheimer's disease suggest that at least part of these associations might also be a consequence of shared aetiologies as well as potential medication effects.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: People with autoimmune arthritides are more likely to experience mood and anxiety disorders, even relative to counterparts with other similarly burdensome chronic illnesses.",BMJ Ment Health
40158220,Structural basis of oligomerization-modulated activation and autoinhibition of orphan receptor GPR3.,"G protein-coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) is a class A orphan receptor characterized by high constitutive activity in the G<sub>s</sub> signaling pathway. GPR3 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and the regulation of thermogenesis in human adipocytes, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its self-activation and potential endogenous modulators remain unclear. In this study, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GPR3 in different oligomerization states, both in the absence and presence of G protein. Notably, in addition to the monomeric form of GPR3, our findings reveal a functional GPR3 dimer with an extensive dimer interface-a feature rarely observed in class A GPCRs. Moreover, oligomerization appears to be linked to a unique autoinhibition mechanism involving intracellular loops, which may regulate GPR3 signaling. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the oligomerization-modulated activation of orphan GPCRs, advancing our understanding of their signaling properties.",Cell Rep
40139290,Executive Control from Healthy Ageing to Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review of Stroop and Simon effects using Psychophysiological and Imaging Techniques.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in the ageing population emphasises the need for strategies to mitigate cognitive decline. While research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has focused on early risk factors, less attention has been paid to protective factors such as cognitive reserve (CR) and cognitive control (CC).
METHODS: This review examines age-related changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in healthy ageing and cognitive impairment. We analysed studies using Stroop and Simon tasks in conjunction with EEG, EEG/ERP, fNIRS and fMRI.
RESULTS: Of the 1411 articles reviewed, 49 studies met our criteria. The results suggest that the Stroop and Simon effects are essential for distinguishing between healthy ageing and cognitive impairment. Increased activity of the PFC supports task performance, especially in cognitive ageing. However, when compensatory mechanisms fail, deficits in Stroop and Simon effects may indicate cognitive impairment and reduced activation of the PFC.
CONCLUSION: This review emphasises the critical role of CR in attenuating age-related cognitive decline and highlights the importance of the PFC in maintaining CC.",Neurosci Biobehav Rev
40100675,scDrugLink: Single-Cell Drug Repurposing for CNS Diseases via Computationally Linking Drug Targets and Perturbation Signatures.,"Central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as glioblastoma (GBM), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain challenging due to their complexity and limited treatments. Conventional drug repurposing strategies often rely on bulk RNA sequencing data, which can overlook cellular heterogeneity and mask rare but critical cell populations. Here, we introduce scDrugLink, a computational method that integrates single-cell transcriptomic data with drug targets and perturbation signatures to improve repurposing. For each cell type, scDrugLink constructs a Drug2Cell matrix based on drug targets to estimate promotion/inhibition scores and derives sensitivity/resistance scores by reverse matching signatures and disease-associated genes. These scores are then ""linked,"" yielding robust therapeutic rankings. In our study, we present a systematic evaluation of single-cell drug repurposing methods for CNS diseases. Applied to atlas data for GBM, MS, and AD, scDrugLink surpassed three state-of-the-art methods (ASGARD, DrugReSC, and scDrugPrio), achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranges of 0.6286-0.7242 and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) ranges of 0.3412-0.5484. It also ranked top when comparing AUC and AUPRC at the level of individual cell types. Moreover, applying the ""linking"" principle to baseline methods boosted their performance, on average improving AUC and AUPRC by 0.0160 and 0.0244, respectively. Despite the advancements, the complexity and heterogeneity of CNS diseases, along with incomplete drug data, indicate that further improvement is necessary. We discuss these challenges and suggest directions for enhancing single-cell drug repurposing in the future.",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform
40155721,Denoising Search doubles the number of metabolite and exposome annotations in human plasma using an Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer.,"Chemical exposures may affect human metabolism and contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Identifying these small metabolites involves matching experimental spectra to reference spectra in databases. However, environmental chemicals or physiologically active metabolites are usually present at low concentrations in human specimens. The presence of noise ions can substantially degrade spectral quality, leading to false negatives and reduced identification rates. In response to this challenge, the Spectral Denoising algorithm removes both chemical and electronic noise. Spectral Denoising outperformed alternative methods in benchmarking studies on 240 tested metabolites. It improved high confident compound identifications at an average 35-fold lower concentrations than previously achievable. Spectral Denoising proved highly robust against varying levels of both chemical and electronic noise even with a greater than 150-fold higher intensity of noise ions than true fragment ions. For human plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease that were analyzed on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, Denoising Search detected 2.5-fold more annotated compounds compared to the Exploris 240 Orbitrap instrument, including drug metabolites, household and industrial chemicals, and pesticides.",Nat Methods
40163151,Mitochondrial-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: a review of the current literature.,"Neurodegenerative disorders present significant challenges to modern medicine because of their complex etiology, pathogenesis, and progressive nature, which complicate practical treatment approaches. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important contributor to the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This review paper examines the current literature highlighting the multifaceted functions of mitochondria, including energy production, calcium signaling, apoptosis regulation, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, axonal transport, endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial interactions, mitophagy, mitochondrial proteostasis, and their crucial involvement in neuronal health. The literature emphasizes the increasing recognition of mitochondrial dysfunction as a critical factor in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, marking a shift from traditional symptom management to innovative mitochondrial-based therapies. By discussing mitochondrial mechanisms, including mitochondrial quality control (MQC) processes and the impact of oxidative stress, this review highlights the need for novel therapeutic strategies to restore mitochondrial function, protect neuronal connections and integrity, and slow disease progression. This comprehensive review aims to provide insights into potential interventions that could transform the treatment landscape for neurodegenerative diseases, addressing symptoms and underlying pathophysiological changes.",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol
40120485,Illustrate the metabolic regulatory effects of Ganoderma Lucidum polysaccharides on cognitive dysfunction in formaldehyde-exposed mouse brain by mass spectrometry imaging.,"Long-term formaldehyde (FA) exposure causes cognitive dysfunction, often associated with metabolic disorders. While some studies suggest Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) can improve cognitive function, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the effects of GLP on FA-exposed cognitive dysfunction and the regulation of GLP on brain metabolic disturbances caused by FA remain unclear. In our study, we revealed that GLP significantly reversed FA-exposed spatial cognitive deficits in mice by using Morris Water Maze and Histological analysis. Furthermore, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) found that exposure of FA can caused dysregulated expression of 35 metabolites. Following GLP treatment, there was a significant restoration of the imbalance of choline and acetylcholine, carnitine and acetylcarnitine, and spermidine and spermine, which were all involved in choline metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and polyamine metabolism. Our results suggested that GLP alleviated FA-exposed cognitive dysfunction, likely through modulation of metabolic pathways, providing a potential therapeutic approach for FA-related cognitive dysfunction.",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf

This study aimed to establish the growth kinetics and HupA production by the newly HupS21 cell line grown in 250 mL flasks and in a 2 L airlift bioreactor. Methods: Batch-type kinetics were carried out for 60 days in 250 mL flasks and for 20 days in a 2 L airlift bioreactor. Measurements of dry weight (DW), specific growth rate (μ), doubling time (dt), pH, carbohydrate consumption, and HupA quantification were performed. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory assay of the HupS21 alkaloidal extract was determined. Results: The 250 mL flasks kinetic reached a maximum cell growth of 8.17 g/L DW, with a μ of 0.045 day<sup>-1</sup> and a dt of 15.40 days. The maximum HupA production was of 2.03 μg/g DW at day 45. In the 2 L airlift reactor, a maximum growth of 16.70 g/L DW, a μ of 0.062 day<sup>-1</sup>, a dt of 11.20 days, and HupA production of 2.48 μg/g DW at day 15 were obtained. The alkaloidal extract from the HupS21 cell line at 100 μg/mL showed an AChE inhibitory activity of 85.6 ± 1.27%. Conclusions: The airlift reactor outperformed the flask cultures in maximum cell growth, specific growth rate, doubling time, and HupA production. To our knowledge, this research is the first report on the establishment of suspension cell cultures of P. taxifolius in shaken flasks and in an airlift bioreactor, providing a foundation for scaling up HupA production for pharmaceutical use.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel)
40077827,Factors Associated With Alzheimer's Dementia Diagnosis and Survival in Down Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying factors associated with dementia onset and subsequent survival will support in understanding the disease profile, improving timely diagnosis, management, and care planning.
METHOD: Variables associated with age at dementia onset and survival times were assessed in 279 adults with DS who accessed a community learning disability service. After outliers were removed, regression and hazard regression models were used for disease onset (n = 265) and survival times (n = 180), respectively.
RESULTS: Earlier age at first assessment and living with family predicted earlier age at diagnosis, which led to longer survival, post-diagnosis. Epilepsy and living in a long-stay hospital were associated with earlier mortality.
CONCLUSION: Implications for clinical practice include reflections on the importance of early baseline assessments and caregiver awareness. Suggestions for future research include investigating intersectionality of social factors with genetics to better understand AD trajectories.",J Intellect Disabil Res

Finding a novel therapeutic anti-Alzheimer agent with high efficacy and minimal side effects, we have designed and synthesized benzothiazolidinone-derived thiadiazole-based Schiff base derivatives (1-15). Biological assessment of these compounds was carried out against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, and all the derivatives showed varying degrees of inhibitory activity. Analog 8 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.60 ± 0.20 and 4.10 ± 0.20 μM for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively) demonstrated spellbinding efficacy in contrast to standard donepezil (IC<sub>50</sub> = 50 ± 0.10 and 8.10 ± 0.20 μM). The surpassing inhibition of analog 8 is due to highly reactive CF<sub>3</sub> moiety at the para-position, inhibiting the enzymes via strong hydrogen bond. Analog 7 with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.70 ± 0.10 and 6.20 ± 0.40 μM was also found with strong therapeutic potential than standard drug. The strong inhibition potential of lead compounds was also evaluated under enzyme kinetics and spellbinding potential was observed.

40083619,A Proposed Role for Lymphatic Supermicrosurgery in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease: A Primer for Reconstructive Microsurgeons.,"The relatively recent discovery of a novel lymphatic system within the brain meninges has spurred interest in how waste products generated by neurons and glial cells-including proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau-are disposed of. Evidence is building that suggests disease progression in AD and other cognitive impairments could be explained by dysfunction in the brain's lymphatic system or obstruction of drainage. An interesting implication of this hypothesis is that, by relieving the obstruction of flow, lymphatic reconstruction along the drainage pathway could serve as a potential novel treatment. Should this concept prove true, it could represent a surgical solution to a problem for which only medical solutions have thus far been considered. This study is meant to serve as a primer for reconstructive microsurgeons, introducing the topic and current hypotheses about the potential role of lymphatic drainage in AD. A preview of current research evaluating the feasibility of lymphatic reconstruction as a surgical approach to improving Aβ clearance is provided, with the aim of inspiring others to design robust preclinical and clinical investigations into this intriguing hypothesis.",Arch Plast Surg
40097074,Early social deficits in TgF344-AD rats are accompanied by sex-specific parvalbumin-positive interneuron reduction and altered brain oscillations in the hippocampal CA2.,"Social withdrawal and deficits in social cognition are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While early deficits in social behavior and memory have been documented in mouse AD models, they remain understudied in rat models. Early-stage AD is accompanied by dysfunction of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, implicating their potential connection to early symptoms. In this study, we employed a 5-trial social memory task to investigate early deficits in social cognition in 6-month-old TgF344-AD male and female rats. We counted the number of PV+ interneurons and recorded local field potentials during social interactions in the hippocampal CA2 - a region critical for social information processing. Our results show decreased social interest and novelty preference in TgF344-AD male and female rats. However, reduced PV+ interneuron numbers were observed only in female rats and specific to the CA2 area. The electrophysiological recordings revealed reduced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the CA2 during direct social interactions. We conclude that deficits in social cognition accompany early-stage AD in TgF344-AD rats and are potentially linked to PV+ interneuron and brain oscillatory dysfunction in the CA2 region of the hippocampus.",Neurobiol Dis
40039975,Cross-Modality Translation with Generative Adversarial Networks to Unveil Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers.,"Generative approaches for cross-modality transformation have recently gained significant attention in neuroimaging. While most previous work has focused on case-control data, the application of generative models to disorder-specific datasets and their ability to preserve diagnostic patterns remain relatively unexplored. Hence, in this study, we investigated the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to generate functional network connectivity (FNC) and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging data from each other. We employed a cycle-GAN to synthesize data in an unpaired data transition and enhanced the transition by integrating weak supervision in cases where paired data were available. Our findings revealed that our model could offer remarkable capability, achieving a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.89 ± 0.003 for T1s and a correlation of 0.71 ± 0.004 for FNCs. Moreover, our qualitative analysis revealed similar patterns between generated and actual data when comparing AD to cognitively normal (CN) individuals. In particular, we observed significantly increased functional connectivity in cerebellar-sensory motor and cerebellar-visual networks and reduced connectivity in cerebellar-subcortical, auditory-sensory motor, sensory motor-visual, and cerebellar-cognitive control networks. Additionally, the T1 images generated by our model showed a similar pattern of atrophy in the hippocampal and other temporal regions of Alzheimer's patients.",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
40151921,The prevalence of mild behavioral impairment in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundMild behavioral impairment is a neurobehavioral symptom characterized by the onset of a new and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome. Patients with co-occurring mild behavioral impairment and mild cognitive impairment have the relatively highest probability of developing dementia than sick mild behavioral impairment or mild cognitive impairment alone.ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the currently available best estimate of mild behavioral impairment prevalence and clarify the reasons for the difference in estimates.MethodsData were retrieved and collected from five electronic databases. Two reviewers independently appraised the methodological quality of included studies. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the I² statistic and random effects models were employed. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. All statistical analyses were conducted by Stata.ResultsA total of 23 reports involving 5397 participants were included in this systematic review. The pooled effect size for the overall mild behavioral impairment was 52% (95%CI 42-62%). In the subgroup analysis and regression analysis, we found that study type, study area, assessment tools, and study subject gender could explain part of the source of heterogeneity.ConclusionsThe results of this review suggest that 52% with mild cognitive impairment combined with mild behavioral impairment; there is a close relationship between the two. Future studies should pay more attention to the underlying mechanism between the two and provide a more scientific basis for early discrimination of clinical dementia and Alzheimer's disease.",J Alzheimers Dis

To contribute to an advancement in this field, we developed an in vitro multi-organ-on-a-chip system, that we named PEGASO platform, which enables the dynamic culturing of human cell-based models relevant for drug testing. The PEGASO platform is composed of five independent connected units, which are based on a previously developed millifluidic organ-on-a-chip device (MINERVA 2.0), hosting human primary cells and iPSC-derived cells recapitulating key biological features of the gut, immune system, liver, blood-brain-barrier and brain that were fluidically connected and challenged to model the physiological passage of donepezil, a drug prescribed for Alzheimer's disease. The nutrient medium flow rate of the connected units was tuned to obtain suitable oxygenation and shear stress values for the cells cultured in dynamic condition. A computational model was at first developed to simulate donepezil transport within the platform and to assess the drug amount reaching the last organ-on-a-chip. Then, we demonstrated that after 24 hours of donepezil administration, the drug was actually transported though the cell-based models of the platform which in turn were found viable and functional. Donepezil efficacy was confirmed by the decreased acetylcholinesterase activity at the brain model and by the increased expression of a donepezil-relevant multi-drug transporter (P-gp). Overall, the PEGASO platform is an innovative in vitro tool for drug screening and personalized medicine applications which holds the potential to be translated to preclinical research and improve new drug development pipelines.",Lab Chip

Although tau pathology can be assessed using tau positron emission tomography, a more accessible biomarker is needed for diagnosis, prognosis and tracking treatment effects. Here we present a new plasma tau species, the endogenously cleaved, microtubule-binding region containing residue 243 (eMTBR-tau243), which specifically reflects tau tangle pathology. Across the AD spectrum in three different cohorts (n = 108, 55 and 739), plasma eMTBR-tau243 levels were significantly elevated at the mild cognitive impairment stage and increased further in dementia. Plasma eMTBR-tau243 showed strong associations with tau positron emission tomography binding (β = 0.72, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) and cognitive performance (β = 0.60, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.40), outperforming other plasma tau (%p-tau217 and %p-tau205) biomarkers. These results suggest that plasma eMTBR-tau243 may be useful for estimating the tauopathy load in AD, thereby improving the diagnostic evaluation of AD in clinical practice and monitoring the efficacy of tau-targeted therapies in clinical trials.",Nat Med

Cultural background differences significantly affect cognitive test performance. For China, which is rapidly aging, a culturally adaptive picture naming test is urgently needed.ObjectiveThis study aims to develop a Chinese naming test (CNT) adapted to the cultural background of Chinese people and to explore its correlation with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers.MethodsA total of 1459 participants were recruited, including 744 with normal cognition (NC), 492 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 223 with dementia. All participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The diagnostic capability of CNT was determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. Part of participants underwent amyloid-β (Aβ) PET scans, tau-PET scans, and MRI scans. The relationships between CNT scores and Aβ and tau deposition, as well as brain structural changes, were analyzed.ResultsThe diagnostic capability of CNT for MCI showed a sensitivity of 68.7%, specificity of 75.6%, and AUC of 0.81; for dementia, the sensitivity was 72.7%, specificity was 89.5%, and AUC was 0.89. The correlation coefficient between CNT scores and brain Aβ burden was -0.11 (p = 0.024). CNT scores correlated with tau burden in different Braak stages (p < 0.05). The correlation coefficient between CNT scores and hippocampus atrophy was -0.15 (p = 0.003).ConclusionsThe CNT has good diagnostic performance in detecting MCI and dementia in Chinese population. There is a correlation between CNT scores and AD imaging markers, indicating that the CNT might has potential value in predicting cognitive changes and disease progression.",J Alzheimers Dis
40083905,Membrane-assisted Aβ40 aggregation pathways.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the assembly of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides into oligomers and fibrils. Endogenous Aβ aggregation may be assisted by cell membranes, which can accelerate the nucleation step enormously, but knowledge of membrane-assisted aggregation is still very limited. Here, we used extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to structurally and energetically characterize key intermediates along the membrane-assisted aggregation pathways of Aβ40. Reinforcing experimental observations, the simulations reveal unique roles of GM1 ganglioside and cholesterol in stabilizing membrane-embedded β sheets and of Y10 and K28 in the ordered release of a small oligomeric seed into solution. The same seed leads to either an open-shaped or R-shaped fibril, with significant stabilization provided by inter- or intra-subunit interfaces between a straight β sheet (residues Q15-D23) and a bent β sheet (residues A30-V36). This work presents a comprehensive picture of membrane-assisted aggregation of Aβ40, with broad implications for developing AD therapies and rationalizing disease-specific polymorphisms of amyloidogenic proteins.",Cell Rep Phys Sci

While these differences receive increasing attention in isolation, they likely link to similar processes in the brain. Hence, this review aims to present an overview of the influences of sex chromosomes, hormones, and aging on male and female brains across health and disease, with a particular focus on AD and stroke. The focus here on advancements across several fields holds promise to fuel future research and to lead to an enriched understanding of the brain and more effective personalized neurologic care for all.",Sci Adv
39995599,Anti-amyloid treatments: Why we think they are worth it.,"UNLABELLED: Years of experience watching our patients progressively decline and die from complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has strongly motivated us to provide newly approved anti-amyloid treatments to appropriate patients. Following detailed and personalized discussions of the potential risks and benefits of these treatments with patients and their families, almost 300 patients at our clinic have chosen to receive lecanemab infusions. We have found the frequency and severity of complications, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), to be manageable and as expected based on clinical trials. While the longer-term benefits of these treatments are not yet clear, our patients and their families are accepting of even a modest slowing of disease progression. We have experienced the complexities, burdens, costs, and major logistical challenges associated with the treatment of AD with anti-amyloid treatments. However, we also understand that for some of our current patients with early symptomatic AD, anti-amyloid treatments are their best option for fighting this devastating disease, and we find it worthwhile to provide these treatments to our patients.

40144735,InGSA: integrating generalized self-attention in CNN for Alzheimer's disease classification.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that slowly impair the mental abilities. Early diagnosis, nevertheless, can greatly reduce the symptoms that are associated with the condition. Earlier techniques of diagnosing the AD from the MRI scans have been adopted by traditional machine learning technologies. However, such traditional methods involve depending on feature extraction that is usually complex, time-consuming, and requiring substantial effort from the medical personnel. Furthermore, these methods are usually not very specific as far as diagnosis is concerned. In general, traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have a problem with identifying AD. To this end, the developed framework consists of a new contrast enhancement approach, named haze-reduced local-global (HRLG). For multiclass AD classification, we introduce a global CNN-transformer model InGSA. The proposed InGSA is based on the InceptionV3 model which is pre-trained, and it encompasses an additional generalized self-attention (GSA) block at top of the network. This GSA module is capable of capturing the interaction not only in terms of the spatial relations within the feature space but also over the channel dimension it is capable of picking up fine detailing of the AD information while suppressing the noise. Furthermore, several GSA heads are used to exploit other dependency structures of global features as well. Our evaluation of InGSA on a two benchmark dataset, using various pre-trained networks, demonstrates the GSA's superior performance.",Front Artif Intell
40148290,Dietary inflammatory index and brain disorders: a Large Prospective Cohort study.,"There is emerging evidence that diet plays a key contributor to brain health, however, limited studies focused on the association of dietary inflammatory potential with brain disorders. This study aimed to examine the association of dietary inflammation with brain disorders in the UK biobank. The prospective cohort study used data from 2006 to 2010 from the UK Biobank, with the median follow-up duration for different outcomes ranging between 11.37 to 11.38. Dietary inflammatory index and Energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index [DII and EDII] were assessed through plausible dietary recalls. Outcomes included brain disorders (all-cause dementia [ACD], Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], stroke, sleep disorder, anxiety and depression disorder) and brain magnetic resonance imaging measures. Cox proportional-hazard models, restricted cubic spline model [RCS], Ordinary least squares regressions, and structural equation models were used to estimate associations. Of 164,863 participants with available and plausible dietary recalls, 87,761 (53.2%) were female, the mean (SD) age was 58.97 (8.05) years, and the mean (SD) education years was 7.49 (2.97) years. Vegetables and fresh fruits show significant anti-inflammatory properties, while low-fiber bread and animal fats show pro-inflammatory properties. The nonlinear associations of DII and EDII scores with ACD, AD, sleep disorder, stroke, anxiety, and depression were observed. Multivariable-adjusted HRs for participants in highest DII score VS lowest DII score were 1.165 (95% CI 1.038-1.307) for ACD, 1.172 (95% CI 1.064-1.291) for sleep disorder, 1.110 (95% CI 1.029-1.197) for stroke, 1.184 (95% CI 1.111-1.261) for anxiety, and 1.136 (95% CI 1.057-1.221) for depression. Similar results were observed with regard to EDII score. Compared with the lowest EDII score group, the highest group showed a higher risk of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, stroke and dementia. Results from sensitivity analyses and multivariable analyses were similar to the main results. Pro-inflammatory diets were associated with a higher risk of brain disorders. Our findings suggest a potential means of diet to lower risk of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, stroke, and dementia.",Transl Psychiatry
40124756,Effects of an interdisciplinary programme on psychoemotional factors in informal caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes a progressive deterioration in the person's memory and cognitive function, leading to a greater degree of dependency as the disease progresses. This causes a progressive increase in caregiver overload, leading to physical, psychological, and social impairments. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a nine-month interdisciplinary intervention covering three areas (cognitive-behaviour, psycho-emotional, and physical activity) on various psycho-emotional variables in informal caregivers of people with AD. A trial was conducted in which 59 informal caregivers of people with AD were administered various instruments to assess psychoemotional aspects (EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels, Zarit Burden Inventory test, Satisfaction with Life Scale, General Happiness Questionnaire, Occupational Balance Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Duke-UNC-11 Functional Social Support Questionnaire, and the Family Apgar Scale). Significant between-group improvements were obtained in occupational balance at 3 (p = 0.002), 6 (p = 0.013) and 9 months (p = 0.022) of intervention, in perceived social support at 3 months (p = 0.043) and satisfaction with life at 6 months (p = 0.020). No significant between-group differences were found in the remaining variables, although there were positive trends in intra-group scores for caregiver overload, quality of life, life satisfaction and family functioning. Thus, an interdisciplinary programme could have a positive influence on the variables assessed in informal caregivers of AD.",Front Psychol

In the current study, a new series of 17-oximino-16-substituted steroids (1-8) has been evaluated in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease in mice and amyloid-β induced Alzheimer's disease in rats with an intention to discover an effective and efficient neuroprotective molecule. Behavioural studies followed by histopathological and estimation of the several neuroinflammatory biochemical parameters such as acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxide, reactive oxygen, and nitric oxide species were carried out. A significant improvement in cognitive and locomotive dysfunctions was observed after treatment with these compounds. In silico molecular docking and simulation studies also correlated with the neuroprotective effects of the steroidal oximes 1-8 as strong binding affinities for TNF-α, IL-1β, AChE and β-secretase were seen. Among all the compounds, 4-pyridylidene (3) and 2-pyridylidene (1) substituted steroids displayed maximum neuroprotective efficacy in animal models of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, respectively, and produced effects better than standard drugs. Hence, a new series of 16-arylideno-17-oximino steroids has been identified as potent neuroprotective agents which could be further explored structurally and clinically to discover and develop lead drug molecules useful for the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.",Eur J Pharmacol
40156318,Effects of Early Midlife Ovarian Removal on Medial Temporal Lobe Gray Matter Volume and Recognition Memory.,"Early midlife bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with greater Alzheimer's disease risk compared to spontaneous/natural menopause. Previously, we found that participants with BSO had lower volume in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 2/3 composite subfield (DG-CA2/3). We sought to extend those hippocampal subfield findings by assessing whether BSO affected volumes along the anteroposterior hippocampal axis, anterolateral entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex subregions (Brodmann area (BA) 35 and 36). We also correlated volumes with key demographic and wellbeing-related factors (age, depressive mood, education), hormone therapy characteristics, and recognition memory performance. Early midlife participants with BSO (with and without 17β-estradiol therapy (ET)) and age-matched control participants with intact ovaries (AMC) completed high-resolution T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medial temporal lobe volumes and Remember-Know task recognition memory performance were compared between groups-BSO (n = 23), BSO + ET (n = 28), AMC (n = 34) using univariate analyses. Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses were used to examine how volumes related to demographic and wellbeing-related factors, as well as hormone therapy characteristics. Relative to BSO + ET, BSO had lower posterior hippocampal and DG-CA2/3 volumes but greater perirhinal BA 36 volumes. Compared to age, depressive mood, and education, ET was the strongest positive predictor of hippocampal volumes and negative predictor of perirhinal BA 36 volumes. For BSO + ET, hippocampal volumes were negatively related to ET duration and positively related to concurrent progestogen therapy. Relative to AMC, BSO had greater anterolateral entorhinal cortex and perirhinal BA 35 and BA 36 volumes. BSO groups (with and without ET) relied more on familiarity than recollection for successful recognition memory. BSO and ET may have distinct effects on medial temporal lobe volumes, with potential implications for memory processes affected by Alzheimer's disease risk.",Hippocampus

The PreC hub appears the most resilient to AD pathology, suggesting differential vulnerability within the DMN. However, the mechanisms that underlie this differential pathobiology remain obscure. Here, we investigated changes in RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and splicing proteins U1-70K, U1A, SRSF2, and hnRNPA2B1, phosphorylated AT8 tau, 3R and 4Rtau isoforms containing neurons and amyloid plaques in layers III and V-VI in FC, PreC, and PCC obtained from individuals with a preclinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild/moderate mAD. We found a significant increase in pS5-RNA pol II levels in FC NCI, U1-70K in PreC MCI and mAD, and hnRNPA2B1 and SRSF2 levels in PCC mAD. 1N3Rtau levels were significantly increased in FC, decreased in PreC in mAD, and unchanged in PCC, whereas 1N4Rtau increased in mAD across the hubs. SRSF2, U1-70K, U1A, and hnRNPA2B1 nuclear optical density (OD), size, and number were unchanged across groups in FC and PCC, while PreC OD hnRNPA2B1 was significantly greater in mAD. Mislocalized U1A and U1-70K tangle-like structures were found in a few PCC cases and colocalized with AT8-bearing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). FC pS5-RNA pol II, PreC U1-70K, Pre pS5,2-RNA pol II, and PCC hnRNPA2B1 and SRSF2 protein levels were associated with cognitive decline but not neuropathology across clinical groups. By contrast, splicing protein nuclear OD measures, size, counts, and mislocalized U1-70K and U1A NFT-like structures were not correlated with NFT or plaque density, cognitive domains, and neuropathological criteria in DMN hubs. Findings suggest that RNA splicing protein alterations and U1 mislocalization contribute differentially to DMN pathogenesis and cognitive deterioration in AD.",Brain Pathol
40124279,Intestinal flora was associated with occurrence risk of chronic non-communicable diseases.,"BACKGROUND: The intestinal flora (IF) has been linked to risks of non-communicable diseases, especially various cancers, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. However, many uncertainties of these associations during different stages of growth, development, and aging still exist. Therefore, further in-depth explorations are warranted.
AIM: To explore the associations of the human IF with disease risks during different stages of growth, development, and aging to achieve more accurate and convincing conclusions.
METHODS: Cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, and Mendelian randomization studies published in the PubMed and Web of Science databases until December 31, 2023 were systematically reviewed to clarify the associations of the IF at the genus level with the risks of various non-communicable diseases, which were grouped in accordance with the 10<sup>th</sup> revision of the International Classification of Diseases.
RESULTS: In total, 57 studies were included to quantitatively examine the influence of the IF on the risks of 30 non-communicable diseases during different stages of growth, development, and aging. Population studies and Mendelian randomization studies confirmed positive associations of the abundances of Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus with multiple sclerosis.
CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the roles of the IF and provide novel evidence for effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases. In the future, it will be necessary to explore a greater variety of research techniques to uncover the specific mechanisms by which gut microbiota trigger diseases and conduct in-depth studies on the temporal relationship between microbiota alterations and diseases, so as to clarify the causal relationship more accurately.",World J Gastroenterol
40116546,"Insights From TgF344-AD, a Double Transgenic Rat Model in Alzheimer's Disease Research.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia worldwide, is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, tauopathy, neuronal loss, neuro-inflammation, brain atrophy, and cognitive deficits. AD manifests as familial early-onset (FAD) with specific gene mutations or sporadic late-onset (LOAD) caused by various genetic and environmental factors. Numerous transgenic rodent models have been developed to understand AD pathology development and progression. The TgF344-AD rat model is a double transgenic model that carries two human gene mutations: APP with the Swedish mutation and PSEN-1 with delta exon 9 mutations. This model exhibits a complete repertoire of AD pathology in an age-dependent manner. This review summarizes multidisciplinary research insights gained from studying TgF344-AD rats in the context of AD pathology. We explore neuropathological findings; electrophysiological assessments revealing disrupted synaptic transmission, reduced spatial coding, network-level dysfunctions, and altered sleep architecture; behavioral studies highlighting impaired spatial memory; alterations in excitatory-inhibitory systems; and molecular and physiological changes in TgF344-AD rats emphasizing their age-related effects. Additionally, the impact of various interventions studied in the model is compiled, underscoring their role in bridging gaps in understanding AD pathogenesis. The TgF344-AD rat model offers significant potential in identifying biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic interventions, providing a robust platform for advancing translational AD research.

40141432,A TMT-Based Proteomic Analysis of Osmoregulation in the Gills of Oreochromis mossambicus Exposed to Three Osmotic Stresses.,"Salinity and alkalinity are critical environmental factors that affect fish physiology and ability to survive. Oreochromis mossambicus is a euryhaline species that can endure a wide range of salinities and has the potential to serve as a valuable model animal for environmental science. In order to detect the histomorphological changes, antioxidant enzymes, and proteomic responses of O. mossambicus to different osmotic stresses, O. mossambicus was subjected to salinity stress (25 g/L, S_S), alkalinity stress (4 g/L, A_S), saline-alkalinity stress (salinity: 25 g/L, alkalinity: 4 g/L, SA_S), and freshwater (the control group; C_S). The histomorphological and antioxidant enzyme results indicated that salinity, alkalinity, and saline-alkalinity stresses have different degrees of damage and effects on the gills and liver of O. mossambicus. Compared with the control, 83, 187, and 177 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the salinity, alkalinity, and saline-alkalinity stresses, respectively. The obtained DEPs can be summarized into four categories: ion transport channels or proteins, energy synthesis and metabolism, immunity, and apoptosis. The KEGG enrichment results indicated that DNA replication and repair were significantly enriched in the salinity stress group. Lysosomes and oxidative phosphorylation were considerably enriched in the alkalinity stress group. Comparatively, the three most important enriched pathways in the saline-alkalinity stress group were Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. The findings of this investigation yield robust empirical evidence elucidating osmoregulatory mechanisms and adaptive biological responses in euryhaline teleost, thereby establishing a scientific foundation for the cultivation and genomic exploration of high-salinity-tolerant teleost species. This advancement facilitates the sustainable exploitation of saline-alkaline aquatic ecosystems while contributing to the optimization of piscicultural practices in hypersaline environments.",Int J Mol Sci
40085647,Transcriptional signatures of hippocampal tau pathology in primary age-related tauopathy and Alzheimer's disease.,"In primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates share a similar structure and anatomic distribution, which is distinct from tau pathology in other diseases. However, transcriptional similarities between PART and AD and gene expression changes within tau-pathology-bearing neurons are largely unknown. Using GeoMx spatial transcriptomics, mRNA was quantified in hippocampal neurons with and without tau pathology in PART and AD. Synaptic genes were down-regulated in disease overall but up-regulated in tau-pathology-positive neurons. Two transcriptional signatures were associated with intraneuronal tau, both validated in a cortical AD dataset. Genes in the up-regulated signature were enriched in calcium regulation and synaptic function. Notably, transcriptional changes associated with intraneuronal tau in PART and AD were similar, suggesting a possible mechanistic relationship. These findings highlight the power of molecular analysis stratified by pathology and provide insight into common pathways associated with tau pathology in PART and AD.",Cell Rep
40167846,Ferroptosis and Alzheimer's: unveiling new avenues for the treatment and prevention.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative illnesses worldwide, has a devastating effect on individual, families and society. Despite the extensive research and effort, various clinical trials aimed against amyloid-β, which is suspected to have a causative role in the illness, have not yet shown any clinically significant success to date. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis, a kind of programmed cell death triggered by lipid peroxidation and dependent on iron, plays a role in AD. There is a complex relationship between AD and ferroptosis. In both the processes iron dysregulation, altered anti-oxidant mechanisms and lipid peroxidation is involved. Ferroptotic processes contributes to the neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress and damage to the neurons as observed in AD. Additionally, amyloid-β, a hallmark of AD, may influence the ferroptosis, further linked the two pathways. Numerous signalling pathways such as Phospho inositide 3-kinase, Glycogen synthase kinase-3β, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and Sirtuin pathway plays a part in the pathophysiology of AD. Through a comprehensive review of current research and experimentation, this investigation elucidates the interactions between novel pharmacological agents (ferroptotic inhibitors) and AD-related pathways. Furthermore, this review highlights the various ferroptotic inhibitors as the therapeutic agents for the slowing down the progression of AD. The crosstalk between these processes could unveil the potential therapeutic targets for the AD treatment.",Metab Brain Dis
40045780,Ribosomes: from conserved origin to functional/medical mobility and heterogeneity.,"Ribosomes, the molecular machines that translate the genetic code from mRNA into proteins in all living cells, are highly structurally conserved across all domains of life and hence are believed to have evolved from a structurally unified pocket. Initially perceived as uniform cellular factories for protein synthesis, currently, ribosomes have emerged as more complex entities. Structural, medical and biochemical studies, including ours, have revealed significant variability in their compositions across tissues, species, functions and developmental stages, highlighting their multifunctional potential. Moreover, the diversity of ribosomes, their components and their associated biological factors challenge the traditional perception of uniform interactions under various conditions, including stress, and expose their mobility and heterogeneity. Evidence for their functional diversity can be seen even in modifications of ribosomal genes, where minor changes may play critical roles under stress or may lead to diseases called ribosomopathies, including Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, some types of cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, through in-depth structural explorations, we improve the understanding of the mechanisms regulating protein biosynthesis in response to various environmental stressors. These findings should potentially reshape the perceptions of the various ribosomal roles.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'Ribosome diversity and its impact on protein synthesis, development and disease'.",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci
40000528,Cosupplementation with DHA and medium-chain triglycerides ameliorates NAFLD and reduces amyloid-β accumulation by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases and is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) play essential roles in lipid metabolism and the inhibition of amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. We aimed to explore the possible association between cerebral Aβ deposition and the development of NAFLD and to investigate the effect of DHA combined with MCTs on delaying NAFLD progression and Aβ accumulation. To this end, 40 three-month-old APP/PS1 male mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups. The mice were fed a control diet, a DHA (2.91 g/kg) diet, an MCTs (100 g/kg) diet, or a DHA + MCTs diet for 8 months. Ten C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet and used as the wild-type (WT) group. The results indicated that APP/PS1 mice exhibited NAFLD and cerebral Aβ accumulation. DHA combined with MCTs decreased blood and liver lipids, relieved hepatic steatosis and fat accumulation, and decreased the level of Aβ in the brain and serum. Moreover, DHA combined with MCTs significantly upregulated the levels of Aβ clearance-related proteins in the liver, modulated the expression of key hepatic lipid metabolism enzymes and upstream hepatic lipid metabolism factors. In conclusion, compared with wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice may be more sensitive to changes in lipid metabolism due to the accumulation of Aβ. DHA combined with MCTs alleviated NAFLD and decreased brain and serum Aβ levels in APP/PS1 mice compared with the control group. The possible mechanism may involve affecting hepatic fat and cholesterol metabolism and increasing hepatic Aβ clearance by modulating liver lipid metabolism enzymes.",Lipids
40008917,"Posterior cingulate cortex microRNA dysregulation differentiates cognitive resilience, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.","INTRODUCTION: MicroRNA (miRNA) activity is increasingly appreciated as a key regulator of pathophysiologic pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of miRNAs during the progression of AD, including resilience and prodromal syndromes such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), remains underexplored.
METHODS: We performed miRNA-sequencing on samples of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) obtained post mortem from Rush Religious Orders Study participants diagnosed ante mortem with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, or AD. NCI subjects were subdivided as low pathology (Braak stage I/II) or high pathology (Braak stage III/IV), suggestive of resilience. Bioinformatics approaches included differential expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) target prediction, interactome modeling, functional enrichment, and AD risk modeling.
RESULTS: We identified specific miRNA groups, mRNA targets, and signaling pathways distinguishing AD, MCI, resilience, ante mortem neuropsychological test performance, post mortem neuropathological burden, and AD risk.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of harnessing miRNA activity to manipulate disease-modifying pathways in AD, with implications for precision medicine.
HIGHLIGHTS: MicroRNA (MiRNA) dysregulation is a well-established feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Novel miRNAs also distinguish subjects with mild cognitive impairment and putative resilience. MiRNAs correlate with cognitive performance and neuropathological burden. Select miRNAs are associated with AD risk with age as a significant covariate. MiRNA pathways include insulin, prolactin, kinases, and neurite plasticity.",Alzheimers Dement
40168071,ABCB1 Gene Polymorphisms and Their Contribution to Cognitive Decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Next-Generation Sequencing Study.,"The ABCB1 gene, encoding the ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1, plays a crucial role in the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and the transport of cholesterol, implicating it in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene and cognitive decline in individuals with MCI, particularly focusing on language function. A longitudinal cohort study involving 1005 participants from the Czech Brain Aging Study was conducted. Participants included individuals with Alzheimer's disease, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), non-amnestic MCI, subjective cognitive decline, and healthy controls. Next-generation sequencing was utilized to analyze the entire ABCB1 gene. Cognitive performance was assessed using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Boston Naming Test and the semantic verbal fluency test. Ten ABCB1 polymorphisms (rs55912869, rs56243536, rs10225473, rs10274587, rs2235040, rs12720067, rs12334183, rs10260862, rs201620488, rs28718458) were significantly associated with cognitive performance, particularly in language decline among amnestic MCI patients. In silico analyses revealed that some of these polymorphisms may affect the binding sites for transcription factors (HNF-3alpha, C/EBPβ, GR-alpha) and the generation of novel exonic splicing enhancers. Additionally, polymorphism rs55912869 was identified as a potential binding site for the microRNA hsa-mir-3163. Our findings highlight the significant role of ABCB1 polymorphisms in cognitive decline, particularly in language function, among individuals with amnestic MCI. These polymorphisms may influence gene expression and function through interactions with miRNAs, transcription factors, and alternative splicing mechanisms.",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci
40086298,Comparing the impact of various exercise modalities on old adults with Alzheimer's disease: A Bayesian network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the elderly is rising, and exercise is increasingly used as a non-pharmacological intervention. However, the most effective exercise modality for improving quality of life, alleviating depression, and reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients remains unclear. This study aims to identify the optimal exercise modality for addressing these symptoms through a network meta-analysis.
METHODS: As of November 2024, we conducted a comprehensive search across six databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. This study included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with study durations ranging from 2 to 24 weeks, primarily set in clinical or community environments. Following the PRISMA-NMA guidelines, we conducted statistical analysis using the ""gemtc"" package in R and assessed evidence quality via the CINeMA online platform.
RESULTS: A network meta-analysis of 29 RCTs with 1507 participants showed that for global cognition, Aerobic exercise (AE) [MD = 2.83, 95 % CI (0.66, 4.85)] ranked first with 79.5 % probability; for quality of daily life, Resistance Training (RT) [SMD = 0.96, 95 % CI (-0.14, 2.07)] ranked first with 83.7 %; for depression, Physical Activity Program (PAP) [SMD = -3.76, 95 % CI (-7.06, -0.47)] ranked first with 96.0 %; and for neuropsychiatric inventory outcomes, AE [SMD = -2.35, 95 % CI (-5.95, 1.06)] ranked first with 71.1 %.

40002497,Effect of N-Acetyl Cysteine as an Adjuvant Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Oxidative stress levels are exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This phenomenon feeds back into the overactivation of oxidase enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), with the stimulation of their receptors (RAGE). These factors stimulate Aβ peptide aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation through multiple pathways, which are addressed in this paper. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on oxidant/antioxidant balance as an adjuvant treatment in patients with AD. The results obtained showed that NAC supplementation produced improved cognitive performance, decreased levels of oxidative stress markers, lowered activities of oxidase enzymes, increased antioxidant responses, and attenuated inflammatory and apoptotic markers. Moreover, NAC reversed mitochondrial dysfunction, lowered AGEs-RAGE formation, attenuated Aβ peptide oligomerization, and reduced phosphorylation of tau, thereby halting the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and the progression of AD.",Brain Sci
40005200,Playing Around the Coumarin Core in the Discovery of Multimodal Compounds Directed at Alzheimer's-Related Targets: A Recent Literature Overview.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes a great socioeconomic burden because of its increasing prevalence and the lack of effective therapies. The multifactorial nature of AD prompts researchers to search for new strategies for discovering disease-modifying therapeutics. To this extent, the multitarget approach holds the potential of synergic or cooperative activities arising from compounds that are properly designed to address two or more pathogenetic mechanisms. As a privileged and nature-friendly scaffold, coumarin has successfully been enrolled as the heterocyclic core in the design of multipotent anti-Alzheimer's agents. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the most recent literature (2018-2023), covering the rational design and the discovery of coumarin-containing multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) whose anti-AD profile encompassed at least two different biological activities relevant for disease onset and progression. To enhance the clarity of presentation, synthetic coumarin-based MTDLs are categorized into four clusters based on their substitution pattern and reported bioactivities: (i) mono-, (ii) di-, and (iii) polysubstituted coumarins directed at protein targets, and (iv) coumarins directed at protein targets with additional metal-chelating features. Before discussing multimodal coumarins, the rationale for addressing each biological target is briefly presented.",Molecules

METHODS: The Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for related studies from inception to May 24, 2024. We included original studies that developed a DL algorithm for [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging to assess diagnostic performance in classifying AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). A bivariate random-effects model was employed to assess the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: We identified 36 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 35 studies distinguished AD from NC, with a pooled AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99). Thirteen studies distinguished AD from MCI, with a pooled AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96). Nineteen studies distinguished MCI from NC, with a pooled AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95). Additionally, we found large amounts of heterogeneity across studies which could be partially attributed to variations in DL methods and imaging modalities.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that DL-assisted [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging has high diagnostic performance in identifying AD. The significant heterogeneity among studies underscores the necessity for future research to incorporate external validation, utilize large sample size, and adhere to rigorous guideline to provide robust support for clinical decision-making.",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging
40155644,Gadolinium based contrast agent induced electrical conductivity heterogeneity analysis in the brain of Alzheimer's disease.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often uses gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to improve the characterization of imaging contrast, owing to their strong paramagnetic properties. Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) visualizes the conductivity distribution of biological tissues at the Larmor frequency using the [Formula: see text] field phase signal. In this paper, we investigate the effect of GBCA on brain conductivity. To compare the differences of reconstructed noisy conductivity maps before and after the GBCA injection, we propose a method to remove the background low-frequency noise artifact based on an elliptic partial differential equation. By analyzing the relationship between electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, the objective of this study is to develop a cost-effective and accessible initial screening imaging tool for diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. To investigate vascular damage in AD, we define a conductivity heterogeneity volume fraction (CHVF) caused by GBCA leakage. Using CHVF, we develop three indices to characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. To verify the proposed method, we studied a total of 42 participants, including 14 individuals diagnosed with AD, 18 participants with MCI, and 10 cognitively normal (CN) participants. Finally, we designed a radar chart informed by the CHVF analysis, to exhibit the pertinent parameters for MCI and AD patients, facilitating the evaluation and ongoing monitoring of each patient's diagnosis and treatment regimen.",Sci Rep
40046340,Association between amyloid-β42 levels and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease trials.,"Research on how Alzheimer's disease drugs impact neuropsychiatric symptoms is limited. Given the link between changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) levels and cognitive and clinical outcomes after anti-Aβ treatments, we hypothesized a similar association exists with neuropsychiatric symptoms. We conducted a meta-analysis of anti-Aβ drugs clinical trials to evaluate whether the changes in cerebrospinal Aβ42 levels are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and if any such effect is mediated by changes in cognitive performance, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data from 10 trials involving 10 746 Alzheimer's disease patients were included. Decreases in Aβ42 levels were associated with worsening Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores (regression coefficient: -0.68; 95% confidence interval: -1.07 to -0.29; P = 0.002), and this association persisted after adjusting for Mini-Mental State Examination. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. Changes in CSF Aβ42 levels are inversely and independently associated with the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in anti-Aβ trials, suggesting a potential role of Aβ42 in modulating neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.",Brain Commun
40145325,Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Loss-of-function variants of the ABCA7 gene are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). How neuronal ABCA7 contributes to AD pathogenesis is unknown.
METHODS: Using neuron-specific Abca7 KO mice (nAbca7<sup>-/-</sup>) with or without 5×FAD amyloid model background and post mortem AD brains, we investigated AD-related phenotypes through comprehensive approaches including transcriptomics and lipidomics.
RESULTS: Lipidomics analysis detected altered lipid profiles in the brains and synaptosomes of 5×FAD; nAbca7<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to controls. Transcriptomics profiling revealed that neuronal ABCA7 deficiency altered the expression of genes and pathways related to mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis, particularly in excitatory neurons. Consistently, synaptosomes isolated from 5×FAD; nAbca7<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed diminished mitochondria respiration and reduced synaptic protein levels, which is further supported by results from human AD brains.
DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal that neuronal ABCA7 plays a critical role in mitochondrial homeostasis important for neuronal function and survival in the presence of AD pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency exacerbates Aβ pathology and neuronal damage in 5×FAD mice. Neuronal ABCA7 deficiency alters brain transcriptomes and lipidomes of 5×FAD mice.

40046632,Impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation and cerebral lymphatic drainage in a rat model of chronic hydrocephalus.,"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) not only protects the brain but also maintains homeostasis by removing metabolic waste produced by brain activity. This study hypothesizes that chronic CSF circulatory dysfunction, such as chronic hydrocephalus or normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), may be a critical condition in neurodegenerative diseases associated with metabolic waste accumulation. To investigate the CSF circulation and cerebral lymphatic drainage in a rat model of chronic hydrocephalus induced by kaolin injection, we performed time-dependent evaluations of intraparenchymal injection of tracers as well as intraventricular injection of Evans blue. The study systemically evaluated the dysfunction of CSF circulation and lymphatic drainage in the brain from various perspectives, including the glymphatic system, transependymal CSF flow, subarachnoid CSF flow, meningeal lymphatic drainage, and peripheral lymphatic drainage to deep cervical lymph nodes. The results indicated delayed CSF circulation, including glymphatic system, and cerebral lymphatic drainage in the kaolin-induced chronic hydrocephalus model. Based on these findings, our research indicated that dysfunction of CSF circulation, as observed in conditions such as chronic hydrocephalus or NPH, may act as an initiating or exacerbating factor in neurodegenerative diseases. This can lead to the accumulation of metabolic waste, as seen in Alzheimer's disease. Our research can help identify risk factors and provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",Front Mol Neurosci

Few studies have sufficient power to evaluate effect modifiers.
METHODS: Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members (n = 705,061; n = 202,937 with sociodemographic surveys) who initiated statins from 2001 to 2010 were matched on age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with non-initiators and followed through 2020 for incident ADRD. Inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate effect modification by age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, income, and immigrant generation.
RESULTS: Statin initiation (vs non-initiation) was not associated with ADRD incidence in any of the 32 subgroups (p > .05). Hazard ratios ranged from 0.964 (95% CI: 0.923 to 1.006) among Asian-identified participants to 1.122 (95% CI: 0.995 to 1.265) in the highest income category.
DISCUSSION: Sociodemographic heterogeneity appears to have little to no influence on the relationship between statin initiation and dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: The study includes a large and diverse cohort from Kaiser Permanente (N = 705,061). An emulated trial design of statin initiation on dementia incidence was used. Effect modification by sociodemographic factors was assessed. There were no significant Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) risk differences in 32 sociodemographic subgroups (p > 0.05).",Alzheimers Dement
39975696,Systematic analysis and prediction of the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias caused by hyperglycemia.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) pose a significant and escalating global public health challenge, particularly among the aging populations. Emerging evidence has identified high fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) as a major modifiable risk factor for ADOD, linking impaired glucose metabolism to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Despite this association, the comprehensive impact of HFPG on the global burden of ADOD has not been fully elucidated. Understanding the extent to which HFPG contributes to ADOD is crucial for developing targeted interventions and optimizing healthcare resource allocation to address this growing concern.
METHODS: Using Global Burden of Disease data (GBD 2021), we analyzed the global HFPG-related ADOD burden from 1990 to 2021 using an age-period-cohort framework and predicted trends for 2050. A Shiny platform was developed to visualize the disease burden and trends across 204 countries and regions.
RESULTS: In 2021, approximately 15% of ADOD deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributed to HFPG, a 271.05% increase from 1990. The incidence rate rose from 47.07 to 66.42, indicating poor control. The mortality rate from HFPG-ADOD increased by 305.81%. The primary burden was among the 80-84 age group. Trends in ASDR and ASMR showed an increase across most SDI regions, except Low SDI. Decomposition analysis and the APC model indicated poor control in high SDI regions due to aging populations over the past 5 years. By 2050, the global prevalence is projected to reach 1,003,018.047 (26124.40377, 12114480.49), with 345,342.5738 (1431.57781, 6022119.213) males and 657,675.4731 (24692.82596, 6092361.28) females. The Shiny platform predicts a yearly increase in ASDR and ASMR for HFPG-ADOD in China, which is consistent with GBD platform trends. The platform is accessible at http://116.196.73.86:3838/GBD/HFPG-ADOD/.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of HFPG-related ADOD has been increasing, even in high SDI regions, over the past 5 years and is expected to continue rising until 2050. Implementing appropriate health policies to mitigate this trend could significantly reduce the substantial burden caused by HFPG-induced ADOD. Promoting the use of the Shiny prediction platform will contribute significantly to global healthy aging.",Front Public Health

Nevertheless, conventional spike sorting methods face limitations in recognizing diverse spike shapes. Here, we introduce PseudoSorter, which uses self-supervised learning techniques, a density-based pseudolabeling strategy, and an iterative fine-tuning process to enhance spike sorting accuracy. Through benchmarking, we demonstrate the superior performance of PseudoSorter compared to other spike sorting algorithms before applying PseudoSorter on MEA recordings from hippocampal neurons exposed to subneuronal concentrations of monomeric Tau as a model for Alzheimer's disease. Our results unveil that Tau diminishes the firing rate of a subset of neurons, which complement our findings observed using conventional electrophysiology analysis, and demonstrate that PseudoSorter's high accuracy and throughput make it a valuable tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms, as well as for therapeutic drug screening.",Sci Adv
40087766,Beyond expectations: investigating nilotinib's potential in attenuating neurodegeneration in alzheimer's disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose a formidable global challenge. While therapeutic options are available, their limitations are significant, necessitating the development of innovative treatment approaches. Here, we highlight the importance of repurposing drugs and discuss the future of drug treatments for AD. We review the potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for mitigating AD pathology and symptoms, as well as neurodegenerative processes more broadly. We focus on nilotinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has unique mechanisms of action involving the modulation of cell responses and removal of toxic proteins associated with AD pathogenesis. Encouraging studies have demonstrated its efficacy, calling for further investigation through clinical trials to assess its potential in various neurodegenerative conditions. However, despite these promising preclinical findings, no clinical studies have yet conclusively demonstrated its efficacy in treating AD. Considering the future directions in AD research, personalized medicine approaches hold promise by incorporating patient-specific factors, including sex and gender differences, to tailor nilotinib treatment for improved efficacy and safety profiles.",Alzheimers Res Ther

40093920,Retinal microvascular density and inner thickness in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major healthcare challenge, with existing diagnostics being costly/infeasible. This study explores retinal biomarkers from optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) as a cost-effective and non-invasive solution to differentiate AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs).
METHODS: Participants from the CALLIOPE Research Program were classified as ""Dem"" (AD and early AD), ""MCI,"" and ""HCs"" using neuropsychological tests and clinical diagnosis by a neurologist. OCT/OCTA examinations were conducted using the RTVue XR 100 Avanti SD-OCT system (VISIONIX), with retinal parameters extracted. Statistical analysis included normality and homogeneity of variance (HOV) tests to select ANOVA methods. Post-hoc analyses utilized Mann-Whitney U, Dunnett, or Tukey-HSD tests based on parameters' normality and HOV. Correlations with age were assessed via Pearson or Spearman tests. A generalized linear model (GLM) using Tweedie regression modeled the relationship between OCT/OCTA parameters and MMSE scores, correcting for age. Another ordinal logistic GLM (OL-GLM) modeled OCT/OCTA parameters against classes, adjusting for multiple confounders.
RESULTS: We analyzed 357 participants: 44 Dem, 139 MCI, and 174 HCs. Significant microvascular density (VD) reductions around the fovea were linked with MCI and Dem compared to HCs. Age-related analysis associated thickness parameters with HCs' old age. Our OL-GLM demonstrated significant thickness/volume reductions in Inner_Retina and Full_Retina layers. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and perimeter were initially not correlated with cognitive decline; however, OL-GLM significantly associated FAZ perimeter enlargement with Dem and MCI groups. Significant average and inferior peripapillary RNFL thinning were linked to Dem and MCI groups.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine VD changes in G grid sections among Dem, MCI, and HCs. We found a significant association between various VD parameters and cognitive decline. Most macular thickness/volume changes did not correlate with cognitive decline initially; however, our OL-GLM succeeded, highlighting the importance of the confounders' corrections. Our analysis excluded individual retinal layer parameters due to limitations; however, the literature suggests their value. Our study confirmed existing biomarkers' efficacy and uncovered novel retinal parameters for cognitive decline, requiring further validation.",Front Aging Neurosci

METHODS: The effects of diet on the presynaptic proteome of the temporal cortex were assessed in 36 female cynomolgus macaques randomized to Mediterranean or Western diets for 31 months. Associations between the presynaptic proteome, determined by synaptometry by time-of-flight (SynTOF) mass spectrometry, adjacent cortex transcriptome, and multi-system phenotypes were assessed using a machine learning approach.
RESULTS: Six presynaptic proteins (DAT, Aβ42, calreticulin, LC3B, K48-Ubiquitin, SLC6A8) were elevated in the presynaptic proteome in Mediterranean diet consumers (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic data and multi-system phenotypes significantly predicted SynTOF markers. Selected SynTOF markers were correlated with changes in white matter volumes, hepatosteatosis, and behavioral and physiological measures of psychosocial stress.
DISCUSSION: These observations demonstrate that diet composition drives cortical presynaptic protein composition, that transcriptional profiles strongly predict the presynaptic proteomic profile, and that presynaptic proteins were closely associated with peripheral metabolism, stress responsivity, neuroanatomy, and socio-emotional behavior.
HIGHLIGHTS: Mediterranean and Western diets differentially altered the cortical presynaptic proteome, which is strongly associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Presynaptic proteomic markers were predicted by transcriptomic profiles in the adjacent cortex, and by multi-system anatomical, physiologic, and behavioral phenotypes. The data demonstrate that brain phenotypes and brain-body interactions are influenced by common dietary patterns, suggesting that improving diet quality may be an effective means to maintain brain health.",Alzheimers Dement

We confirmed a positive correlation between AD and depression through MR Analysis. Through WGCNA analysis, we identified 1569 genes containing two modules, which were most related to AD. In addition, 1629 depressive DEGs were also identified. In these genes, 84 genes were shared by both AD and depression, which were screened by the Degree algorithm, MCC algorithm, and four machine learning algorithms. Two genes (ITGB5 and SPCS1) were confirmed as predictive biomarkers with AUC > 0.7. Furthermore, the nomogram indicated that ITGB5 and SPCS1 are good biomarkers in diagnosing AD with depression. Four drugs targeted at ITGB5 were determined by the DGIdb website. In conclusion, we identified two predictive biomarkers for AD with depression, thus providing promising therapeutic targets for AD with depression.",J Cell Mol Med
40027104,Integration of phytochemical profiling and computational approaches to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of Nardostachys jatamansi in Alzheimer's disease.,"Despite broad spectrum utility of Nardostachys jatamansi (D. Don) DC, little is known about the molecular processes that underlie its anti-Alzheimer action. To investigate the molecular targets and therapeutic potential of N. jatamansi for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we used Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), ADMET analysis, network pharmacology, differential gene expression analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The STITCH database was used for network creation and protein-protein interaction analysis, while Cytoscape was used for network visualization and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) for term enrichment. Additionally, to investigate the intermolecular interactions between the active chemicals and target proteins, molecular docking experiments were conducted using the Blind docking on the Achilles server. The stability of the PS1 gene complex with Spirojatamol, was further evaluated using MD simulations. With Spirojatamol showing the highest binding energy scores against PS1 (-6.9 kcal/mol), molecular docking confirmed the activity of this metabolite against AD targets PS1 and Spirojatamol formed a stable complex at 100 nanoseconds, according to additional investigation using MD simulations. Significant ligand-protein interactions were verified by binding free energy calculations using the MM/GBSA technique. The PS1-Spirojatamol complex had a binding energy of ΔG: -36.95 ± 5.00 kcal/mol. By focusing on several genes and pathways, involved in AD, this work reveals the molecular underpinnings behind N. jatamansi possible use in the treatment of AD.",Biotechnol Rep (Amst)
40137558,RILP Cleavage Links an Inflammatory State to Enhanced Tau Propagation in a Cell Culture Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of tau pathology throughout the brain. Inflammation has been demonstrated to be present in the disease state as well as changes in endocytic trafficking. Here we identify the Rab7 effector RILP, a protein at the intersection of inflammatory states and endocytic trafficking, as a novel player in tau propagation. We show that RILP is cleaved in AD brain and this cleavage correlates to increases in hyperphosphorylated tau. Cleavage can be induced in both BE(2) neuron-like cells as well as a microglia cell line when they are treated with the inflammatory mediators LPS and ATP. This inflammatory state also enhances tau propagation between BE(2) cells, an effect that is mitigated by overexpressing a non-cleavable RILP (ncRILP). Furthermore, microglial cells contribute to intercellular tau propagation through both the release of inflammation-associated factors and the direct uptake and secretion of tau, potentially via extracellular vesicles (EVs). In HMC3 microglial cells, RILP cleavage led to impaired tau degradation, increasing intracellular tau accumulation. Additionally, the RILP cleavage status influences EV secretion in microglia. These findings suggest that RILP cleavage alters the endocytic trafficking of tau causing increased cell-cell propagation in a cell-culture model of Alzheimer's disease.",Mol Biol Cell
39997749,"Polyphenols, Alkaloids, and Terpenoids Against Neurodegeneration: Evaluating the Neuroprotective Effects of Phytocompounds Through a Comprehensive Review of the Current Evidence.","Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a group of chronic, usually age-related, disorders characterized by progressive neuronal loss, deformation of neuronal structure, or loss of neuronal function, leading to a substantially reduced quality of life. They remain a significant focus of scientific and clinical interest due to their increasing medical and social importance. Most neurodegenerative diseases present intracellular protein aggregation or their extracellular deposition (plaques), such as α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and amyloid beta (Aβ)/tau aggregates in Alzheimer's. Conventional treatments for neurodegenerative conditions incur high costs and are related to the development of several adverse effects. In addition, many patients are irresponsive to them. For these reasons, there is a growing tendency to find new therapeutic approaches to help patients. This review intends to investigate some phytocompounds' effects on neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are generally related to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, so phytocompounds can help prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve our aim to provide a critical assessment of the current literature about phytochemicals targeting neurodegeneration, we reviewed reputable databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and COCHRANE, seeking clinical trials that utilized phytochemicals against neurodegenerative conditions. A few clinical trials investigated the effects of phytocompounds in humans, and after screening, 13 clinical trials were ultimately included following PRISMA guidelines. These compounds include polyphenols (flavonoids such as luteolin and quercetin, phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, and other polyphenols like resveratrol), alkaloids (such as berberine, huperzine A, and caffeine), and terpenoids (such as ginkgolides and limonene). The gathered evidence underscores that quercetin, caffeine, ginkgolides, and other phytochemicals are primarily anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective, counteracting neuroinflammation, neuronal oxidation, and synaptic dysfunctions, which are crucial aspects of neurodegenerative disease intervention in various included conditions, such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, depression, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, they show that the use of these compounds is related to significant improvements in cognition, memory, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant behavior, hallucinations, and mood disorders.",Metabolites
40004081,Exploring Potential Medications for Alzheimer's Disease with Psychosis by Integrating Drug Target Information into Deep Learning Models: A Data-Driven Approach.,"Approximately 50% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients develop psychotic symptoms, leading to a subtype known as psychosis in AD (AD + P), which is associated with accelerated cognitive decline compared to AD without psychosis. Currently, no FDA-approved medication specifically addresses AD + P. This study aims to improve psychosis predictions and identify potential therapeutic agents using the DeepBiomarker deep learning model by incorporating drug-target interactions. Electronic health records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were analyzed to predict psychosis within three months of AD diagnosis. AD + P patients were classified as those with either a formal psychosis diagnosis or antipsychotic prescriptions post-AD diagnosis. Two approaches were employed as follows: (1) a drug-focused method using individual medications and (2) a target-focused method pooling medications by shared targets. The updated DeepBiomarker model achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) above 0.90 for psychosis prediction. A drug-focused analysis identified gabapentin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, and others as potentially beneficial. A target-focused analysis highlighted significant proteins, including integrins, calcium channels, and tyrosine hydroxylase, confirming several medications linked to these targets. Integrating drug-target information into predictive models improves the identification of medications for AD + P risk reduction, offering a promising strategy for therapeutic development.",Int J Mol Sci

METHODS: Plasma from 727 subjects (286 AD, 260 MCI, and 181 controls) in a case registry was analyzed using the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma OAβ.
RESULTS: Elevated plasma OAβ was strongly correlated with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD. Patients with MCI with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrated a higher risk of progressing to dementia (hazard ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.137). Baseline plasma OAβ effectively predicted MCI-dementia conversion (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.824, 95% CI 0.752-0.897).
DISCUSSION: The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma OAβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: We recruit study participants of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal controls in a case registry.We use the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ).We observe that elevated plasma OAβ strongly correlates with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and AD.MCI individuals with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrate a higher risk of progressing to dementia.The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma Oaβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from MCI to dementia.",Alzheimers Dement (Amst)
40025716,Understanding causal estimates of smoking behaviors for cognitive impairment: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Smoking has been linked to dementia, but the causal relationship has not been well established.
OBJECTIVE: Our study used a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to examine the impact of different stages and kinds of smoking behavior on cognitive status.
METHODS: We analyzed a Health and Retirement Study sample, categorizing cognitive status into three levels (normal, cognitive impairment-no dementia, dementia) and using self-reported smoking behaviors. We used multivariable logistic regressions to examine associations and MR to examine potential causality. We used smoking polygenic scores as instruments for one-sample MR and validated through two-sample MR with genome-wide association study summary statistics.
RESULTS: Current smoking was associated with 1.33 times higher odds of cognitive impairment-no dementia (95% CI: 1.06, 1.65) in European ancestry participants (N = 7708). Among participants who had ever smoked, each 10 additional year of smoking was associated with 1.11 times higher odds of cognitive impairment-no dementia (95% CI: 1.10, 1.22). Using ever smoking polygenic score as a validated instrumental variable, we detected strong causal effects of ever smoking, current smoking, and total smoking years on cognitive impairment (all p < 0.001). Two-sample MR showed no evidence of causality between smoking behaviors and Alzheimer's disease. No causality was observed in the African ancestry sample (N = 1928).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking behavior was cross-sectionally associated with and potentially on the causal pathway of cognitive impairment-no dementia in the larger European ancestry sample. However, no associations were observed with dementia, and the findings did not replicate across ancestry groups. The causal relationship between smoking and cognitive health remains suggestive but not conclusive. Promoting smoking cessation remains a prudent public health strategy to prevent numerous health conditions, and its potential impact on cognitive health warrants further investigation.",J Alzheimers Dis
40115028,Rocking during sleep reduces motor deficits and beta-amyloid levels in an Alzheimer's mouse model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, beta-amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Growing evidence suggests a strong link between sleep disturbances and AD progression, with disrupted sleep exacerbating AD progression through increased beta-amyloid and tau accumulation. This relationship indicates that improving sleep quality could slow disease progression and mitigate its effects on the brain. We investigated whether vestibular stimulation (rocking) could mitigate AD pathology in 3xTg mice (n = 58, males). Starting in early adulthood (p60), mice underwent 12-h daily rocking during the light period for four months. Rocking increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep initially, although habituation reduced this effect over time. Despite habituation, rocking slowed motor decline and reduced beta-amyloid levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, tau levels remained unaffected. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of non-pharmacological methods to enhance NREM sleep and modify disease trajectory in AD models.",iScience

However, the current gold standard for AD and MCI detection relies on specialized equipment often limited to large testing centers, particularly in low-resource settings like Thailand. Our previous work aimed to create a cost-effective MCI and AD screening method using fundus images but struggled to differentiate between AD and MCI. Henceforth, we developed the proposed methodology, utilizing DenseNet-121 on polar-transformed and zone-selected fundus images, which significantly enhances AD and MCI classification, achieving 83% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, 77% specificity, 87% precision, and an F-1 score of 88%. Moreover, the model's Grad-Cam++ heatmap highlights vasculature differences, particularly in tortuosity and thickness, between AD and MCI fundus images.

40094122,"Ligature-induced periodontitis in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease dysregulates neuroinflammation, exacerbates cognitive impairment, and accelerates amyloid pathology.","A growing body of literature has identified periodontal disease among the modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying this relationship is unknown. This study investigated this relationship using a ligature-induced preclinical periodontitis (Pd) model in non-transgenic (non-Tg) and 3xTg-AD mice. We found that ligature placement caused significant alveolar bone loss, with 3xTg-AD mice exhibiting exacerbated bone loss, suggesting AD-related genetic risk may amplify disease progression. Pd induced robust local inflammatory gene expression in both genotypes, but 3xTg-AD mice indicated a dysregulated immune response. Cognitive deficits were observed only in Pd-afflicted 3xTg-AD mice, specifically in hippocampus-mediated spatial memory and perirhinal cortex-mediated object recognition memory, while non-Tg mice remained unaffected. Neuroinflammatory responses varied by brain region, with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) showing the most pronounced changes. In these regions, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited significantly altered cytokine gene expression compared to non-Tg mice, particularly at later time points. Synaptic markers revealed vulnerabilities in 3xTg-AD mice, including reduced baseline Syp expression and dysregulated Synpo post-ligature. Pd transiently reduced glutamate receptor gene expression in both genotypes, with non-Tg mice showing persistent changes, potentially linked to preserved memory. Pd also accelerated amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and sustained neurodegeneration in 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, this study shows that combining Pd and AD-related genetic risk exacerbates inflammation, cognitive impairment, synaptic dysfunction, Aβ pathology, and neurodegeneration. Neither insult alone was sufficient to produce these effects, highlighting the synergistic impact. These findings emphasize the need to explore anti-inflammatory interventions and downstream mechanisms to mitigate the confluence of these diseases.",Brain Behav Immun Health
40149831,Olfactory Testing and Gray Matter Volume: A Combined Approach to Predict the Conversion to Alzheimer.,"Background/Objectives: Olfactory decline is common in normal aging and frequent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, it has been suggested as a marker for the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) progression to AD. Although suggested, the relationship between olfactory deficits and cerebral atrophy in MCI conversion to AD is still debated. This study aims at investigating the olfaction-related morphological and behavioural alterations in MCI in order to understand whether they can predict the progression to AD. Methods: Twenty-seven MCI patients and thirty-five healthy controls (HCs) took part in the study, with follow-up showing conversion to AD in thirteen patients (converter-MCI, cMCI). The Burgarth Sniffin' Sticks Tests (threshold-TT, discrimination-DT, identification-IT) assessed the olfactory capacities. The Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis investigated the atrophic patterns. Results: The Receiving Operating Characteristics analyses demonstrated that DT and IT could distinguish HC from MCI (DT Area Under Curve-AUC = 0.8; IT AUC = 0.8), as well as cMCI from sMCI (stable) patients (DT AUC = 0.7; IT AUC = 0.6), similarly to memory and executive functions tests. Olfactory performance positively correlated with memory tests in sMCI (all rhos ≥ 0.8, all ps &lt; 0.01), whereas it positively correlated with executive functions in cMCI (all rhos ≥ 0.6, all ps &lt; 0.05). VBM results revealed distinct atrophic patterns in cMCI, especially in the olfactory cortex, that were already present at the MCI diagnosis, before AD conversion. A larger volume of the olfactory cortex was associated with better memory and executive functions. Conclusions: Quantitative olfactory and morphological patterns represent non-invasive, predictive biomarkers of the MCI progression to AD; thus, their assessments at MCI onset allows earlier interventions for MCI patients.",Brain Sci
40000321,Feasibility and acceptability of remote APOE-genotyping among research volunteers of an online recruitment registry (The Dutch Brain Research Registry).,"BACKGROUND: Participant recruitment for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention studies is challenging. Online registries facilitate large scale prescreening of individuals at risk for AD to accelerate recruitment. APOE-prescreening has the potential to better identify at-risk individuals. This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of at-home APOE-genotyping in cognitively-normal registrants of an online registry.
METHODS: We invited 9,287 cognitively-normal registrants of Dutch Brain Research Registry (DBRR) aged 50 to 75 for at-home APOE-genotype testing, without receiving the results. Feasibility was measured by participation ratio (participation/interested), swab-return ratio (returned-swabs/participation), and genotyping-success ratio (analyzed swabs/returned swabs). Acceptability was measured with online questions about information provision and project scope. We explored prescreening questions potentially reducing screen-failures.
RESULTS: Feasibility was high with an 0.89 participation ratio (2,886/3,251), 0.90 swab-return ratio (2,886/2,597), 0.99 genotyping-success ratio (2,558/2,597). Acceptability was high, as participants were content with the information provision (87 %-97 %, n= 1,709-1,894), which was also well understood (91 %-93 %, n = 1,772-1,802). Among successful-analyzed swabs (n = 2,558), 27 % participants were APOE-ε4 heterozygote (n = 703), and 2 % homozygote (n = 60). Prescreening on a positive family history leads to a third reduction in the number of invitations needed to identify one APOE-ε4 carrier.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that APOE-ɛ4 genotyping in participants of an online research registry is feasible, well received and could be used to prescreen individuals at risk for AD for prevention studies. Adding a positive family history before invitation for APOE-genotyping, would further improve the prescreening process and reduce screen failures when identifying carriers.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis
39976882,Beyond the beats: a systematic review of the underlying inflammatory pathways between atrial fibrillation and cognitive decline.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) and cognitive decline represent significant health challenges with increasing prevalence and significant socioeconomic implications. Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between AF and cognitive decline, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Inflammation has emerged as a key mediator in cardiovascular and neurological diseases, encouraging an investigation into its role in the atrial fibrillation-cognition association. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo was conducted to identify relevant studies investigating possible inflammatory mechanisms bridging AF and cognitive decline. Studies were assessed for quality and relevance, and data were synthesized using a narrative approach. Five papers were included, with only two longitudinal studies. Inflammatory biomarkers emerged as significant factors associated with both AF and cognitive decline. Three studies revealed a correlation between high-sensitivity CRP (HS-CRP) levels and cognitive decline in patients with AF, AF patients with cerebral infarction, and elderly individuals with AF. However, conflicting results were observed, as one study did not identify any associations between cognitive decline and HS-CRP levels. The scientific literature on this topic is scarce, and the results of existing studies often lack consistency in their findings, highlighting the need for further research to better understand and prevent this significant health burden in patients with AF. So, the results of this study are expected to inform future research directions and cognitive decline risk stratification, guiding the development of targeted interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving outcomes in patients with AF.",Neurol Sci

In this study, we assessed the interdependence between brain regions in patients with early-stage dementia based on phase-lock values, and constructed a functional brain network, selecting network feature parameters for metrics based on complex network analysis methods. At the same time, the entropy information characterizing the EEG signals in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain, as well as the nonlinear dynamics features such as Hjorth and Hurst indexes were extracted, respectively. Based on the statistical analysis, the feature parameters with significant differences between different conditions were screened to construct feature vectors, and finally multiple machine learning algorithms were used to realize the recognition of early categories of dementia patients. The results showed that the fusion of multiple features performed well in the categorization of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobe dementia and healthy controls, especially in the identification of Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, the accuracy of β-band reached 98%, which showed its effectiveness.

40138234,Phase-Locked Time-Stretch Optical Coherence Tomography for Contrast-Enhanced Retinal Microangiography.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography has transformed retinal vascular imaging by providing non-invasive, high-resolution visualization. However, achieving an optimal balance between field of view, resolution, and three-dimensional microvasculature contrast, particularly in deeper retinal layers, remains challenging. A phase-locked time-stretch optical coherence tomography microangiography system is developed to address these limitations with a 5-MHz A-line rate and sub-nm phase sensitivity. Utilizing a dual chirped fiber Bragg grating architecture, the swept-source laser achieves an extended coherence length of ~10 mm and a 102-nm bandwidth. A time-stretch analog-to-digital converter overcomes the limitations of conventional multi-MHz optical coherence tomography systems, ensuring a 2-mm imaging depth in the air with high spatial resolution. The proposed system enables high-contrast, depth-encoded mapping of key retinal structures, including the superficial and deep capillary plexuses and the choriocapillaris. Compared to a state-of-the-art system, the proposed approach demonstrates enhanced resolution, improved contrast, and faster imaging speeds, enhancing its potential for diagnosing and monitoring retinal and systemic diseases like age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and Alzheimer's disease.",IEEE Trans Med Imaging

40085352,From Clinic to Mechanisms: Multi-Omics Provide New Insights into Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolites and the Spectrum of Psychiatric Disorders.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial in maintaining brain homeostasis by facilitating waste clearance, nutrient transport, and immune signaling. However, the links between CSF metabolites and psychiatric disorders, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain largely unexamined. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate potential causal relationships between CSF metabolites and 12 psychiatric disorders. Summary data for psychiatric disorders were sourced from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, while information on CSF metabolites was derived from two studies within the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease cohort. Causal estimates and pleiotropy were assessed using several robust methods, including inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis, weighted median analysis, MR-Egger regression, and the MR-Egger test. Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study was conducted to explore potential mechanisms and shared etiologies between CSF metabolites and psychiatric disorders. The genetic risk of eating disorders (ED) can be increased by leucine (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.21-1.97, P = 4.35 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), salicylate (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, P = 4.95 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), and 1-methylnicotinamide (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.09, P = 6.94 × 10⁻<sup>6</sup>), while methylmalonate may reduce ED risk (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 1.31 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>). Similarly, the risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) may be reduced by threonate (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.97, P = 1.98 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), oxalate (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.97, P = 3.15 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), phenyllactate (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98, P = 2.23 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>), N-acetylglucosamine (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, P = 3.57 × 10⁻<sup>5</sup>), and citramalate (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99, P = 5.78 × 10⁻<sup>4</sup>).

Signal pathways related to the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR), post-translational protein modifications, and immune regulation may mediate the causal relationship of CSF metabolites on ED and SCZ. We identified a casual genetic causal relationship between CSF metabolites and both ED and schizophrenia SCZ, which is potentially mediated by pathways related to energy metabolism, post-translational modifications, and immune regulation.",Mol Neurobiol
40117046,Pea Peptide Modulates Abnormal Aβ Production in PC12 Cells Induced by Lead Exposure.,"Lead (Pb) exposure poses significant health risks, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of pea peptide (PP4) on PC12 cells exposed to Pb. Using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), pretreatment with PP4 at 50 and 200 µM concentrations significantly improved cell viability compared to Pb-only treated cells (P < 0.05), indicating a protective effect. Moreover, Pb exposure led to increased Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) expression at 10 and 20 µM after 24 h (P < 0.05), while β-site amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels were elevated across all concentrations tested (P < 0.05). We established that PP4 can mitigate Pb-induced cytotoxicity and reduce the expression of APP and BACE1 by activating the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase / Protein Kinase (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway.

40017724,dyphAI dynamic pharmacophore modeling with AI: a tool for efficient screening of new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.,"Therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) often involve inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), underscoring the need for novel inhibitors with high selectivity and minimal side effects. A detailed analysis of the protein-ligand pharmacophore dynamics can facilitate this. In this study, we developed and employed dyphAI, an innovative approach integrating machine learning models, ligand-based pharmacophore models, and complex-based pharmacophore models into a pharmacophore model ensemble. This ensemble captures key protein-ligand interactions, including π-cation interactions with Trp-86 and several π-π interactions with residues Tyr-341, Tyr-337, Tyr-124, and Tyr-72. The protocol identified 18 novel molecules from the ZINC database with binding energy values ranging from -62 to -115 kJ/mol, suggesting their strong potential as AChE inhibitors. To further validate the predictions, nine molecules were acquired and tested for their inhibitory activity against human AChE. Experimental results revealed that molecules, 4 (P-1894047), with its complex multi-ring structure and numerous hydrogen bond acceptors, and 7 (P-2652815), characterized by a flexible, polar framework with ten hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, exhibited IC₅₀ values lower than or equal to that of the control (galantamine), indicating potent inhibitory activity. Similarly, molecules 5 (P-1205609), 6 (P-1206762), 8 (P-2026435), and 9 (P-533735) also demonstrated strong inhibition. In contrast, molecule 3 (P-617769798) showed a higher IC<sub>50</sub> value, and molecules 1 (P-14421887) and 2 (P-25746649) yielded inconsistent results, likely due to solubility issues in the experimental setup. These findings underscore the value of integrating computational predictions with experimental validation, enhancing the reliability of virtual screening in the discovery of potent enzyme inhibitors.",Front Chem
40082927,Summarizing attributable factors and evaluating risk of bias of Mendelian randomization studies for Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive status: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: No effective treatment is available to delay or reverse the onset and progression of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Mild cognitive impairment, a clinical state between normal aging and AD, may offer the proper window for AD intervention and treatment. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) studies exploring factors attributable to AD and related cognitive status and to assess its credibility.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library to identify MR studies investigating the associations between any factor and AD and related cognitive status. The risk of bias in MR studies was evaluated using nine signaling questions tailored to identify potential biases based on the STROBE-MR guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 125 eligible publications were examined, including 106 AD-related MR studies reporting 674 records and 28 cognition-related MR studies reporting 141 records. We identified 185 unique causal risk factors for AD and 49 for cognitive status. More than half of the MR studies reporting AD or cognitive status outcomes exhibited poor methodological quality, with a high risk of bias observed in 59% of the AD-related studies and 64% of the cognitive-related studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review summarized modifiable factors and omics signatures, providing a database of MR studies on AD and related cognitive status. The evaluation of bias risk in MR studies serves to raise awareness and improve overall quality. A critical appraisal checklist for assessing the risk of bias may pave the way for the development of a standardized tool.

40047700,FLIM-Phasor Analysis (FLIM-ϕ) of Aβ-Induced Membrane Order Alterations: Towards a Cell-Based Biosensor for Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and its early detection can be critical for a prompt intervention that can potentially slow down the disease progression and improve the patient's quality of life. However, a diagnosis based solely on clinical symptoms can be challenging, especially in the early stages, while the detection of specific biomarkers such as amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and tau proteins can provide objective evidence for diagnosis. In this work, we explored the effects of Aβ peptide on cell membrane properties thanks to fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) combined with the phasor analysis (FLIM-ϕ). The results showed that the membrane viscosity is altered by the presence of Aβ peptide and that cells experience this effect even at nanomolar concentrations of peptide. This considerable sensitivity opens up the possibility of envisioning a cell-based biosensor able to detect very low concentrations of Aβ in a biological fluid, thus enabling timely diagnosis and intervention.",Micromachines (Basel)
40164587,Modulation of CREB3L2-ATF4 heterodimerization via proteasome inhibition and HRI activation in Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology includes transcriptional changes in the neurons, which are in part caused by the heterodimerization of two stress response transcription factors, CREB3L2 and ATF4. We investigated the role of proteasome inhibition and the eIF2α-kinase HRI in the formation of CREB3L2-ATF4 in neurons exposed to soluble oligomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub>. While HRI activation increased ATF4 expression, it decreased CREB3L2 and CREB3L2-ATF4 levels. Proteasome inhibition, induced by Aβ<sub>42</sub>, leads to increased levels of both transcription factors in the nucleus. These findings suggest that CREB3L2 levels are normally kept low due to rapid degradation, but proteasome inhibition in response to Aβ<sub>42</sub> disrupts this balance, increasing CREB3L2 and heterodimer levels. Activation of HRI not only reduced CREB3L2 and heterodimer levels but also prevented the transcriptional dysregulation of a CREB3L2-ATF4 target, SNX3. Our results suggest that manipulating the HRI pathway during proteasome inhibition could help restore normal gene expression in the context of AD-related protein accumulation.",Cell Death Dis
40085681,A microglia clonal inflammatory disorder in Alzheimer's disease.,"Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however, few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in humans, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.",Elife
40133566,Linking genomic and proteomic signatures to brain amyloid burden: insights from GR@ACE/DEGESCO.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with a strong genetic component, yet many genetic risk factors remain unknown. We combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on amyloid endophenotypes measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) as surrogates of amyloid pathology, which may provide insights into the underlying biology of the disease. We performed a meta-GWAS of CSF Aβ42 and PET measures combining six independent cohorts (n = 2,076). Given the opposite beta direction of Aβ phenotypes in CSF and PET measures, only genetic signals showing opposite directions were considered for analysis (n = 376,599). We explored the amyloidosis signature in the CSF proteome using SOMAscan proteomics (ACE cohort, n = 1,008), connected it with GWAS loci modulating amyloidosis and performed an enrichment analysis of overlapping hits. Finally, we compared our results with a large meta-analysis using publicly available datasets in CSF (n = 13,409) and PET (n = 13,116). After filtering the meta-GWAS, we observed genome-wide significance in the rs429358-APOE locus and annotated nine suggestive hits. We replicated the APOE loci using the large CSF-PET meta-GWAS, identifying multiple AD-associated genes including the novel GADL1 locus. Additionally, we found 1,387 FDR-significant SOMAscan proteins associated with CSF Aβ42 levels. The overlap among GWAS loci and proteins associated with amyloid burden was minimal (n = 35). The enrichment analysis revealed mechanisms connecting amyloidosis with the plasma membrane's anchored component, synapse physiology and mental disorders that were replicated in the large CSF-PET meta-analysis. Combining CSF and PET amyloid GWAS with CSF proteome analyses may effectively elucidate causative molecular mechanisms behind amyloid mobilization and AD physiopathology.",Funct Integr Genomics
40149872,Tau Oligomers Resist Phase Separation.,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form condensates under physiological conditions, facilitating microtubule stabilization and intracellular transport. LLPS has also been implicated in pathological Tau aggregation, which contributes to tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. While LLPS is known to promote Tau aggregation, the relationship between Tau's structural states and its phase separation behavior remains poorly defined. Here, we examine how oligomerization modulates Tau LLPS and uncover key distinctions between monomeric, oligomeric, and amyloidogenic Tau species. Using dynamic light scattering and fluorescence microscopy, we monitored oligomer formation over time and assessed oligomeric Tau's ability to undergo LLPS. We found that Tau monomers readily phase separate and form condensates. As oligomerization progresses, Tau's propensity to undergo LLPS diminishes, with oligomers still being able to phase separate, albeit with reduced efficiency. Interestingly, oligomeric Tau is recruited into condensates formed with 0-day-aged Tau, with this recruitment depending on the oligomer state of maturation. Early-stage, Thioflavin T (ThT)-negative oligomers co-localize with 0-day-aged Tau condensates, whereas ThT-positive oligomers resist condensate recruitment entirely. This study highlights a dynamic interplay between Tau LLPS and aggregation, providing insight into how Tau's structural and oligomeric states influence its pathological and functional roles. These findings underscore the need to further explore LLPS as a likely modulator of Tau pathogenesis and distinct pathogenic oligomers as viable therapeutic targets in tauopathies.",Biomolecules
40034347,"Cardio and cerebrovascular diseases risk among Alzheimer's disease patients and racial/ethnic disparities, based on Hawaii Medicare data.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) are significant concerns among the elderly, sharing overlapping risk factors. Hawaii's unique demographic profile, characterized by its strong ethnic diversity, shows marked racial health disparities. For instance, the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) population is identified as a high-risk group for multiple health conditions, including CVD.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of AD on the risk of developing CVD, with a focus on racial influences, utilizing Hawaii Medicare data.
METHODS: Employing nine years of longitudinal Hawaii Medicare data, this study identified elderly patients diagnosed with AD who subsequently developed heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or stroke. To assess the risk of CVD, we utilized multistate models and employed propensity score-matched controls. Additionally, we evaluated racial and ethnic differences in the risk of these diseases, while accounting for other relevant risk factors.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed an elevated risk of AMI, HF, and IHD among individuals diagnosed with AD. Additionally, socioeconomic status (SE) was identified as a crucial factor in the risk of cardio and cerebrovascular diseases. Within the low SE group, NHPIs exhibited increased risks of HF and IHD compared to their white counterparts. Interestingly, NHPIs demonstrated reduced risks of HF in the higher SE group.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of AD increases the likelihood of developing AMI, HF, and IHD. Moreover, the risk of CVD appears to be influenced by race/ethnicity in Hawaii, as well as socioeconomic status.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep

We also utilized the comprehensive lab animal monitoring system (CLAMS) to measure whole-body energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio (RER). We found that ethanol exposure increased glucose metabolism in the brain as measured by FDG-PET. Also, CLAMS data indicated a decrease in RER, suggesting a shift toward fat utilization as the primary energy source. Following ethanol exposure in APP/PS1 mice, these findings reveal a distinct metabolic difference between brain and peripheral tissues.",Mol Brain
39982688,Polypharmacology and Neuroprotective Effects of Gingerol in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that results in brain shrinkage and the death of brain cells. The search for new treatment agents with many targets is now crucial due to the insufficient effectiveness, and adverse effects, including pharmacokinetic issues of traditional AD medications. Although phytochemicals have anti-disease characteristics and thus are widely used and accepted by people, researchers have also determined some of their most beneficial functions. Sesquiterpenes, volatile oils, and aromatic ketones (gingerols) are abundant in ginger. The most pharmacologically active components of ginger are considered to be gingerols. These gingerols are the compounds that impart spicy characteristics to the plant. Besides, gingerols readily undergo dehydration and produce another class of compounds, shogaols. These gingerols, shogaols, and other compounds, like zingerone, are mainly responsible for their distinctive aroma and pharmacological effects. This review aims to delineate the therapeutic potentials of gingerol in different AD models by assessing available literature reporting its effect on various cellular and molecular pathways. Although ginger is well recognized as a non-toxic nutraceutical, existing clinical research lacks robust evidence to support its efficacy in treating NDs, including AD. Clinical studies did not provide sufficient data that supports its use in treating various NDs including AD. Therefore, further research is essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of ginger and its constituents, ultimately paving the way for its development as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",Mol Neurobiol
40131785,Radiofrequency radiation and Alzheimer's disease: harmful and therapeutic implications.,"PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. The relationship between AD and radiofrequency (RF) radiation emitted by wireless devices remains under investigation. The aim of this review is to comprehensively explore the effects of RF radiation on AD by evaluating existing literature. This review used Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed to find relevant studies on AD and RF radiation. This review evaluates a total of 81 studies, including animal models, human studies, and in vitro experiments, with results summarized in tables for clarity.
CONCLUSION: Some studies suggest RF aggravates AD by increasing oxidative stress, impairing blood-brain barrier integrity, and promoting amyloid-beta deposition. Conversely, other studies indicate RF may have protective benefits, such as enhancing brain mitochondrial functions and reducing amyloid-beta levels. Understanding the RF-AD relationship, including parameters like frequency and exposure time, is crucial for therapeutic strategies. The studies reviewed highlight RF radiation's dual effects on AD, underscoring the need for a detailed approach. Further studies are required to clarify these effects and inform preventive and therapeutic measures.",Int J Radiat Biol
40026213,CPNE7 Regulates Amyloidogenesis Through CAP1-Dependent ADAM10 Translation.,"The accumulation of amyloid plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which ADAM10, the α-secretase that catalyzes APP and facilitates the non-amyloidogenesis pathway, plays an important role. We have previously reported that the expression of copine-7 (Cpne7) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice is significantly upregulated by nicotine, whereas the potential role of CPNE7 in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we report that CPNE7 protein levels are significantly decreased in APP/PS1 mice and HEK293 cells stably expressing full-length APP. CPNE7 is shown to reduce Aβ levels by favoring ADAM10 activity, and the elevated ADAM10 protein by CPNE7 involves a translational mechanism. Further transcriptome profiling reveals that CPNE7 differentially regulates genes associated with neuronal function. Among these, cyclase-associated actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein 1 (CAP1) is identified as a target gene of CPNE7, which controls ADAM10 translation through binding to the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). Collectively, the CPNE7-CAP1 axis could be critical in the amyloidogenic pathway by regulating ADAM10 translation, in which the RNA binding activity of CAP1 is highlighted.",J Neurochem
40110691,"Fibrillar tau alters cerebral endothelial cell metabolism, vascular inflammatory activation, and barrier function in vitro and in vivo.","INTRODUCTION: The presence of tau aggregates in and around the brain vasculature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies suggests its possible pathogenicity to cerebral endothelial cells (ECs).
METHODS: We used an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to understand the mechanisms of fibrillar tau-mediated cerebral EC and BBB pathology, confirming our findings in 3-month-old P301S mice brains and extracted microvessels.
RESULTS: Protofibrillar and fibrillar tau species induce endothelial barrier permeability through an increase in glycolysis, which activates ECs toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, inducing loss of junction protein expression and localization. The Warburg-like metabolic shift toward glycolysis and increased vascular pathological phenotypes are also present in young P301S mice.
DISCUSSION: In sum, our work reveals that fibrillar tau species, by enhancing endothelial glycolytic metabolism, promote vascular inflammatory phenotypes and loss of BBB function, highlighting the importance of addressing and targeting early tau-mediated neurovascular damage in AD and tauopathies.
HIGHLIGHTS: We improve the understanding of the mechanisms of vascular pathology in tauopathies. Fibrillar tau mediates vascular metabolic changes, inflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. These events are replicated at early stages in a tauopathy mouse model. Inhibiting altered glycolysis reduces BBB permeability and endothelial activation.",Alzheimers Dement

Identifying AD-specific biomarkers can reveal its mechanisms and foster the development of innovative diagnostics and therapies, aiming to unlock new ways to combat this pervasive condition.
METHODS: We analyzed gene expression data using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning (random forest, lasso regression, and SVM-REF) to differentiate AD patients from controls and explore gene functions.
RESULTS: We identified 641 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 22 co-expressed genes, with functional enrichment analysis revealing their involvement in immune responses. Notably, EGR1 emerged as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.
CONCLUSION: In our study, we applied WGCNA, DEGs and diverse machine learning approaches to uncover potential biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and ferroptosis. A particular hub gene emerged as a promising candidate for novel diagnostic and therapeutic markers specifically within the context of ferroptosis in AD. This discovery sheds new light on the pathogenesis of AD, potentially facilitating the development of groundbreaking diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.",Technol Health Care
40119586,"Gastrodin Alleviates Tau Pathology by Targeting the Alzheimer's Risk Gene FERMT2, Reversing the Reduction in Brain Viscoelasticity.","BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incompletely elucidated, and there is a notable deficiency in effective and safe therapeutic interventions. The influence of brain matrix viscoelasticity on the progression of AD has frequently been underestimated. It is imperative to elucidate these overlooked pathogenic factors and to innovate novel therapeutic strategies for AD. Gastrodin, a bioactive constituent derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Gastrodia elata, exhibits a range of pharmacological properties, notably in the enhancement of neural function. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of its action remain insufficiently elucidated. Consequently, this study seeks to examine the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of gastrodin in the context of AD, with particular emphasis on its potential influence on the viscoelastic properties of the brain matrix.
METHODS: This study employs a range of methodologies, including the Morris water maze test, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, atomic force microscopy (AFM), immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, molecular docking, and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), to demonstrate that gastrodin mitigates tau pathology by modulating FERMT2, thereby reversing the deterioration of mechanical viscoelasticity in the brain.
RESULTS: Gastrodin administration via gavage has been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive decline associated with AD, attenuate the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in the hippocampus and cortex, and ameliorate synaptic damage. Additionally, gastrodin was observed to counteract the reduction in brain matrix viscoelasticity in 3xTg-AD mice, as evidenced by the upregulation of extracellular matrix components pertinent to viscoelasticity, notably collagen types I and IV. Furthermore, molecular docking and CETSA revealed a strong binding affinity between gastrodin and FERMT2. Gastrodin treatment resulted in a reduction of FERMT2 fluorescence intensity, which is selectively expressed in astrocytes. Additionally, gastrodin contributed to the restoration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and modulated the expression levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8).
CONCLUSION: Gastrodin treatment has the potential to mitigate tau pathology, thereby enhancing learning and memory in AD mouse models. This effect may be mediated through the modulation of cerebral mechanical viscoelasticity via the mechanosensor FERMT2, which facilitates the restoration of synaptic structure and function. This process is potentially linked to the maintenance of BBB integrity and the modulation of inflammatory factor release.",CNS Neurosci Ther
40076709,Machine Learning Methods for Classifying Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease Using Genomic Data.,"Complex diseases pose challenges in prediction due to their multifactorial and polygenic nature. This study employed machine learning (ML) to analyze genomic data from the UK Biobank, aiming to predict the genomic predisposition to complex diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested logistic regression (LR), ensemble tree methods, and deep learning models for this purpose. LR displayed remarkable stability across various subsets of data, outshining deep learning approaches, which showed greater variability in performance. Additionally, ML methods demonstrated an ability to maintain optimal performance despite correlated genomic features due to linkage disequilibrium. When comparing the performance of polygenic risk score (PRS) with ML methods, PRS consistently performed at an average level. By employing explainability tools in the ML models of MS, we found that the results confirmed the polygenicity of this disease. The highest-prioritized genomic variants in MS were identified as expression or splicing quantitative trait loci located in non-coding regions within or near genes associated with the immune response, with a prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene annotations. Our findings shed light on both the potential and the challenges of employing ML to capture complex genomic patterns, paving the way for improved predictive models.",Int J Mol Sci
40155153,Association between L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine use and delayed dementia conversion: A nationwide longitudinal study in South Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are two of the most common causes of dementia. While early diagnosis and intervention are crucial, available treatments and research concerning the mild cognitive impairment stage remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine in this context.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine on the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease dementia and vascular dementia, as well as its influence on stroke risk DESIGN: A nationwide, population-based cohort study SETTING: Data from South Korea's National Health Insurance Service PARTICIPANTS: Overall, 508,107 patients newly diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment between 2013 and 2016 were included.
INTERVENTION: Patients were classified as users or non-users of L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine based on prescription records.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were the risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia and vascular dementia. Stroke risk was examined as a secondary outcome. A time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for demographic and clinical factors.
RESULTS: Compared to non-users, L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine users had a lower risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (hazard ratio = 0.899, 95 % confidence interval: 0.882-0.918) and vascular dementia (hazard ratio = 0.832, 95 % confidence interval: 0.801-0.865) within 2,435,924 and 662,281.6 person-years, respectively. In patients under 65, L-α glycerylphosphorylcholine significantly reduced the risk of progression to Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. Stroke risk significantly decreased in patients who did not progress to dementia but not in those who did.
CONCLUSIONS: L-α Glycerylphosphorylcholine reduces dementia conversion and stroke risk in patients with mild cognitive impairment, making it a viable early intervention. Future large-scale randomized controlled studies should examine its effects on other dementia subtypes and long-term cognitive outcomes.",J Prev Alzheimers Dis

We analyze a range of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, CNN, LSTM), alongside advanced strategies like federated learning, transfer learning, and blockchain, to improve model robustness, data security, and interoperability. Findings highlight that transfer learning and ensemble methods enhance model adaptability across clinical settings, while blockchain and federated learning effectively address privacy and data standardization.

40161217,"Unravelling pathological ageing with brain age gap estimation in Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and schizophrenia.","Brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE), the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age, might be a putative biomarker aiming to detect the transition from healthy to pathological brain ageing. The biomarker primarily models healthy ageing with machine learning models trained with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. BrainAGE is expected to translate the deviations in neural ageing trajectory and has been shown to be increased in multiple pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Thus, accelerated ageing seems to be a general feature of neuropathological processes. However, neurobiological constraints remain to be identified to provide specificity to this biomarker. Explainability might be the key to uncovering age predictions and understanding which brain regions lead to an elevated predicted age on a given pathology compared to healthy controls. This is highly relevant to understanding the similarities and differences in neurodegeneration in AD and T2D, which remains an outstanding biological question. Sensitivity maps explain models by computing the importance of each voxel on the final prediction, thereby contributing to the interpretability of deep learning approaches. This paper assesses whether sensitivity maps yield different results across three conditions related to pathological neural ageing: AD, schizophrenia and T2D. Five deep learning models were considered, each model trained with different MRI data types: minimally processed T<sub>1</sub>-weighted brain scans, and corresponding grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid tissue segmentation and deformation fields (after spatial normalization). Our results revealed an increased BrainAGE in all pathologies, with a different mean, which is the smallest in schizophrenia; this is in line with the observation that neural loss is secondary in this early-onset condition. Importantly, our findings suggest that the sensitivity, indexing regional weights, for all models varies with age. A set of regions were shown to yield statistical differences across conditions. These sensitivity results suggest that mechanisms of neurodegeneration are quite distinct in AD and T2D. For further validation, the sensitivity and the morphometric maps were compared. The findings outlined a high congruence between the sensitivity and morphometry maps for age and clinical group conditions. Our evidence outlines that the biological explanation of model predictions is vital in adding specificity to the BrainAGE and understanding the pathophysiology of chronic conditions affecting the brain.",Brain Commun
40093519,"Development, biological evaluation, and molecular modelling of novel isocytosine and guanidine derivatives as BACE1 inhibitors using a fragment growing strategy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by significant synaptic loss and neuronal death in brain regions critical for cognitive functions. The disease is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques, which are extracellular constructs consisting mainly of aggregated Aβ42. The latter is a peptide formed by the proteolytic cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two enzymes, β- and γ-secretase. Therefore, inhibition of the aspartic protease β-secretase (BACE1) is considered a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, a limited number of β-secretase inhibitors have reached human trials and eventually failed due to inconclusive therapeutic and/or safety profiles. In this study, we developed drug-like molecules with a β-secretase inhibitory activity using a fragment growing strategy on isocytosine and acyl guanidine warheads. Our approach is based on optimizing the hydrophobic part of the molecules to obtain a conformationally restrained scaffold complementary to the hydrophobic pockets within the enzyme active site. We developed 32 compounds with promising in vitro inhibitory activity against BACE1 down to sub-micromolar IC<sub>50</sub>. Docking simulation studies were performed to understand the mode of binding of the prepared compounds. We demonstrated that compounds with superior activities, such as 16b and 16g, are able to provide the best balance between the steric shape and position of the polar substituent for achieving preferential anchoring into the S1, S3, S1', and S2' sub-pockets. Further, in vivo characterization of selected drug-like candidates of the benzimidazole series AMK-IV, namely 16a and 16k, demonstrated their ability to reduce oxidation stress and their safety within brain and liver tissues.",RSC Med Chem
39993451,Repurposing drugs: promising therapeutic approach against Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious, irreversible, complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss; affecting millions worldwide. Despite decades of research, no effective disease-modifying treatment exists. However, drug repurposing is a progressive step in identifying new therapeutic uses of existing drugs. It has emerged as a promising strategy in the quest to combat AD. Various classes of repurposed drugs, such as antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory, have shown potential neuroprotective effects in preclinical and clinical studies. These drugs act by combating free radicals generation, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta aggregation, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Furthermore, repurposing offers several advantages, including reduced time and cost compared to de novo drug development. It holds immense promise as a complementary approach to traditional drug discovery. Future research efforts should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of repurposed drugs in AD, optimizing drug combinations, and conducting large-scale clinical trials to validate their efficacy and safety profiles.

40118234,Parsimonious EBM: generalising the event-based model of disease progression for simultaneous events.,"The event-based model of disease progression (EBM) infers a temporal ordering of biomarker abnormalities, defining different disease stages, from short-term data. A key modelling choice of the EBM is that biomarker abnormalities, termed events, are serially ordered. This enforces a strict equality between the number of input biomarkers and the number of model stages, limiting its ability to infer simple staging systems and latent disease processes. To overcome this, we introduce the parsimonious event-based model of disease progression (P-EBM). The P-EBM generalises the EBM to allow multiple new biomarker abnormalities, termed ""simultaneous events"", at each model stage. We evaluate the P-EBM performance in simulated data to show it accurately estimates orderings with arbitrary event arrangements under realistic experimental conditions. When applied to sporadic AD data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the P-EBM estimated a sequence with 7 model stages from a dataset of 12 biomarkers that more closely fitted the data than the EBM. The sets of simultaneous events, such as decreased cerebrospinal fluid total tau and p-tau<sub>181</sub>, correspond closely to latent disease processes. P-EBM patient stages were strongly associated with clinical diagnosis at baseline and future conversion and could be accurately estimated from a smaller number of biomarkers than the EBM. The P-EBM enables the data-driven discovery of simple disease staging systems which could highlight new latent disease processes and suggest practical strategies for patient staging.",Neuroimage
40088964,Enteric nervous system dysfunction as a driver of central nervous system disorders: The Forgotten brain in neurological disease.,"The Enteric Nervous System (ENS), often called the ""second brain,"" is a complex network of neurons and glial cells within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It functions autonomously while maintaining close communication with the central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis (GBA). ENS dysfunction plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Disruptions such as altered neurotransmission, gut microbiota imbalance, and neuroinflammation contribute to disease pathogenesis. The GBA enables bidirectional communication through the vagus nerve, gut hormones, immune signaling, and microbial metabolites, linking gut health to neurological function. ENS dysregulation is implicated in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), influencing systemic and CNS pathology through neuroinflammation and impaired barrier integrity. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ENS dysfunction, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and vagus nerve stimulation, which offer novel ways to modulate gut-brain interactions. Unlike previous perspectives that view the ENS as a passive disease marker, this review repositions it as an active driver of neurological disorders. By integrating advances in ENS biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and GBA modulation, this article presents a paradigm shift-emphasizing ENS dysfunction as a fundamental mechanism in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders. This perspective paves the way for innovative diagnostics, personalized gut-targeted therapies, and a deeper understanding of the ENS's role in brain health and disease.",Neuroscience
40128483,Adolescent Alcohol and the Spectrum of Cognitive Dysfunction in Aging.,"Among the many changes associated with aging, inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and throughout the body likely contributes to the constellation of health-related maladies associated with aging. Genetics, lifestyle factors, and environmental experiences shape the trajectory of aging-associated inflammation, including the developmental timing, frequency, and intensity of alcohol consumption. This chapter posits that neuroinflammatory processes form a critical link between alcohol exposure and the trajectory of healthy aging, at least in part through direct or indirect interactions with cholinergic circuits that are crucial to cognitive integrity. In this chapter, we begin with a discussion of how inflammation changes from early development through late aging; discuss the role of inflammation and alcohol in the emergence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI); elaborate on critical findings on the contribution of alcohol-related thiamine deficiency to the loss of cholinergic function and subsequent development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS); and present emerging findings at the intersection of alcohol and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). In doing so, our analysis points toward inflammation-mediated compromise of basal forebrain cholinergic function as a key culprit in cognitive dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol exposure, effects that may be rescuable through either pharmacological or behavioral approaches. Furthermore, our chapter reveals an interesting dichotomy in the effects of alcohol on neuropathological markers of ADRD that depend upon both biological sex and genetic vulnerability.",Adv Exp Med Biol
40035576,Determinants for Substoichiometric Inhibition of IAPP and Aβ Amyloid Aggregations by Bri2 BRICHOS.,"Bri2 BRICHOS, a folded domain of the transmembrane protein Bri2 expressed in both the brain and pancreas, is an experimentally known substoichiometric inhibitor of amyloid aggregation. The molecular chaperone effectively delays fibrillization at low molar ratios for both β-amyloid (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). While discovering effective antiamyloid inhibitors that work at low doses is an appealing strategy to mitigate amyloid toxicity, the molecular mechanism underlying the broad and efficient antiamyloid activity of Bri2 BRICHOS remains unknown. Here, we computationally demonstrated that Bri2 BRICHOS exhibits a stronger binding affinity to fibril seeds than to monomers using atomistic discrete molecular dynamic simulations. By competing with monomers to bind the active elongation sites on newly nucleated, weakly populated fibril seeds, a small amount of Bri2 BRICHOS could block rapid fibril growth via monomer addition. The experimentally observed differential inhibition efficiency against IAPP and Aβ aggregation was found to depend on the relative fibril-binding affinities of the inhibitor compared to those of self-seeding monomers. Our computationally derived determinants for substoichiometric inhibition against amyloid aggregation by Bri2 BRICHOS may inform the future design of potent antiamyloid therapies for AD, T2D, and other amyloid diseases.",ACS Chem Neurosci

METHODS: We performed a factor analysis on the NBRS data from 172 patients with FTD and examined the neural correlates of the selected symptom clusters in a subsample of 67 patients.
RESULTS: Six factors accounted for 56% of total variance across NBRS item scores: Apathy/Blunting, Agitation/Disinhibition, Cognitive/Language, Planning/Insight, Anxiety/Lability, and Psychosis. Symptom clusters showed significant associations with specific regions of cortical thinning: Agitation/Disinhibition with bilateral frontal regions, and Cognition/Language with the left bank of the superior temporal sulcus and supramarginal regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The selected symptom clusters associated with known regions of atrophy in FTD. The NBRS is an effective observational measure that may extend characterization and understanding of FTD.",J Alzheimers Dis Rep
40116682,V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 as a potential predictor of Alzheimer's disease and advanced aging.,"BackgroundV-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4) emerges as a significant player in the immune system pathways. It has been previously identified as a potential hub gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging, underscoring its importance in understanding these conditions.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of serum VSIG4 and identify trends in serum VSIG4 in relationship with other biomarkers and neurological tests.MethodsELISA was used to measure the serum concentration of VSIG4 in AD, compared to healthy subjects. The relationship between VSIG4 levels and the age of the subjects, as well as other AD-related serum proteins and various measures of cognition was examined.ResultsVSIG4 was significantly elevated in the serum of AD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0074). Significant correlations were identified between serum VSIG4 and other notable proteins related to AD and inflammation, such as total tau, neurofilament light (NfL), YKL-40, CD14, FABP3, and TNF-α. Significant correlations were also identified between VSIG4 concentration and the results of neurological tests.ConclusionsSerum VSIG4 may reflect neuroinflammation and altered lipid processing, affecting the cognitive performance of AD and aging.",J Alzheimers Dis
40150062,Olfactory Dysfunction as a Clinical Marker of Early Glymphatic Failure in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"An abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common feature shared by most neurodegenerative disorders. Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is common in the elderly population and is present in 90% of patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, usually preceding the cognitive and motor symptoms onset by several years. Early Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein protein aggregates deposit in brain structures involved in odor processing (olfactory bulb and tract, piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus) and seem to underly OD. The glymphatic system is a glial-associated fluid transport system that facilitates the movement of brain fluids and removes brain waste during specific sleep stages. Notably, the glymphatic system became less functional in aging and it is impaired in several conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. As the nasal pathway has been recently described as the main outflow exit of cerebrospinal fluid and solutes, we hypothesized that OD may indeed be a clinical marker of early glymphatic dysfunction through abnormal accumulation of pathological proteins in olfactory structures. This effect may be more pronounced in peri- and postmenopausal women due to the well-documented impact of estrogen loss on the locus coeruleus, which may disrupt multiple mechanisms involved in glymphatic clearance. If this hypothesis is confirmed, olfactory dysfunction might be considered as a clinical proxy of glymphatic failure in neurodegenerative diseases.",Diagnostics (Basel)
40097131,Exploring Alzheimer's disease treatment: Established therapies and novel strategies for future care.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive function, memory impairment, and alterations in behavior. As the predominant etiology of dementia, AD affects millions of individuals worldwide, with its hallmark pathological feature being the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, which disrupt neuronal function and progressively compromise brain structure. Early clinical manifestations often include forgetfulness, disorientation, and social withdrawal. Primarily impacting the elderly population, AD significantly impairs daily functioning and diminishes overall quality of life. Current therapeutic approaches for AD mainly focus on symptomatic relief and decelerating the disease's progression. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, increase acetylcholine (ACh) levels to enhance cognitive function in individuals with mild to moderate AD. For individuals in more advanced stages of the disease, NMDA receptor antagonists modulate glutamate activity to mitigate excitotoxicity. In addition to pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications such as adherence to a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and cognitive engagement are advocated to support brain health. Novel therapeutic avenues are being explored to address underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, such as metal ion dysregulation within the brain. Furthermore, non-pharmacological approaches, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and patient support groups, provide essential behavioral and emotional support. Cutting-edge research continues to investigate innovative treatments, such as immunotherapies targeting amyloid plaques and tau tangles and neuroprotective compounds derived from natural sources. The goal of these multifaceted strategies is to alleviate symptoms, enhance quality of life, and offer hope for individuals and families affected by AD. This review provides a comprehensive summary of both established and emerging therapeutic interventions for the management of AD.",Eur J Pharmacol
40156279,Accountable care organizations and Medicare payments for residents with ADRD in disadvantaged neighborhoods.,"INTRODUCTION: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are well positioned to promote care coordination. However, robust evidence of ACOs' impact on Medicare payments for residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in disadvantaged neighborhoods remains limited.
METHODS: Using a 2016 to 2020 longitudinal dataset, we examined the effects of ACO enrollment on Medicare payments for people newly diagnosed with ADRD, focusing on the neighborhood Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and its subcategories. Multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were applied.
RESULTS: ACO enrollment was associated with significantly reduced total payments across all SVI subcategories. The highest cost savings were observed among ADRD patients living in neighborhoods with high proportions of racial and ethnic minorities. Results also showed that higher quality ACOs were associated with lower total payments.
DISCUSSION: ACOs have a great potential to save health-care costs for beneficiaries with ADRD living in socially vulnerable neighborhoods, particularly for those residing in areas with higher proportions of racial and ethnic minority populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) reduced Medicare payments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias across neighborhood disadvantage levels. The cost reductions varied by specific indicators of social vulnerability. Highest cost savings were found among residents living with high proportion of racial/ethnic minorities. Cost savings were the greatest among the highest quality ACOs.",Alzheimers Dement
39999809,Deciphering Perspectives: A European Survey on Clinical Decision Support Tools for Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Technological advancements like digital monitoring tools, disease-modifying therapies, and artificial intelligence have been shown to improve the clinical management of neurocognitive diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enhance implementation in daily practice, users' input is essential in the technology development process. This study aimed to determine clinician's perspective of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in the management of dementia and AD.
METHOD: A survey was conducted targeting clinicians practicing in the field of dementia across Europe. A sixty-five-item digital questionnaire was administered, and opinions were inquired across the domains of diagnosis, disease-modifying therapy, and prognosis, including factors that affect tool implementation and utilization.
RESULTS: Eighty-four clinicians (including specialist physicians, psychologists, and nurses) responded to this survey, and more than 50% had no knowledge or experience with CDSS. Most of the respondents reported the ability to predict the likelihood of AD as the most important diagnostic function. It was surprising to find the middling responses for the ability to predict amyloid positivity. The majority indicated assessment of treatment eligibility for disease-modifying therapy as vital, and the ability to predict cognitive and functional decline as the most important prognostic functions. Data accuracy and ease of use were noted as most necessary to facilitate CDSS adoption and implementation.
CONCLUSION: Findings from this study contribute to the future development of CDSS in this field, especially regarding the approval and imminent use of disease-modifying therapies, a comprehensive tool that is precise and user friendly would improve clinical decisions and efficiency.",Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord
40165376,One-year exercise improves cognition and fitness and decreases vascular stiffness and reactivity to CO2 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.,"BackgroundAmnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is often a precursor stage to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aerobic exercise (AE) has received increasing attention in the prevention of AD. While there is some evidence that it improves neurocognitive function in older individuals, the effect of exercise in the long-term is not well understood.ObjectiveTo assess the effect of long-term exercise on cognition, fitness, vascular stiffness, and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).MethodsIn this prospective clinical trial, 27 aMCI participants were enrolled into two groups and underwent 12 months of intervention. One group (n = 11) underwent AE training (6M/5F, age = 66.2 years), and the control group (n = 16) performed stretch training (ST group, 9M/7F, age = 66.4 years). Both groups performed training three times per week with duration and intensity gradually increased over time. CVR was measured at pre- and post-training using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent MRI.ResultsIn the AE group, aerobic fitness improved (p = 0.034) and carotid artery stiffness decreased (p = 0.005), which was not observed in the ST group. In all participants, decreases in carotid artery stiffness were associated with increases in aerobic fitness (p = 0.043). The AE group displayed decreases in CVR in the anterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, FWE corrected); the ST group did not show significant changes in CVR. Several measures of cognition (i.e., inhibition and delayed recall), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functional status ratings improved only in the AE group.ConclusionsThese results suggest that AE may alter cerebral hemodynamics in patients with aMCI which may improve cognitive, psychological, and functional status.",J Alzheimers Dis

39986523,"Synthesis, design, and cholinesterase inhibitory activity of novel 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases: A combined experimental and computational approach.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by cholinergic dysfunction, necessitating the development of potent cholinesterase inhibitors for therapeutic intervention. In this research, a series of novel 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases (S1-S8) was successfully synthesized and tested for their cholinesterase inhibitory activities both in vitro and in silico. 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde reacted with 4-methylbenzene sulfonyl chloride, then refluxed and recrystallized to form 4-formyl-2-methoxyphenyl 4-methyl benzenesulfonate, which combined with 4-amino-5-alkyl(aryl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones in acetic acid to yield Schiff bases. The synthesis yielded high-purity compounds with efficiency ranging from 87.5 % to 99.5 %, confirmed through IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The biological evaluation showed that S4 demonstrated the strongest inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.00 μM, significantly outperforming rivastigmine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.95 μM) and galantamine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 29.5 μM). Additionally, S7 emerged as the most effective inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.77 μM, comparable to rivastigmine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.62 μM) and far stronger than galantamine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 27.8 μM). The K<sub>i</sub> values reinforced the selective inhibition properties, with S4 (1.04 ± 0.003 μM) and S7 (0.61 ± 0.001 μM) showing high affinity for AChE and BChE, respectively. Molecular docking studies identified crucial π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding between the triazole derivatives and key enzyme residues, contributing to their high inhibitory potency. These interactions were further validated through molecular dynamics simulations, which confirmed the stability of the S4 and S7 complexes with AChE and BChE over extended periods. Computational analysis, including FMO studies, supported the experimental data, showing that HOMO-LUMO energy gaps significantly influenced the compounds' reactivity, stability, and inhibitory profiles. Overall, the study presents strong evidence that these novel 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases possess potent and selective cholinesterase inhibition, notably S4 for AChE and S7 for BChE. These results suggest that these novel compounds have significant potential as selective cholinesterase inhibitors, particularly for Alzheimer's disease, warranting further in vivo studies.",Int J Biol Macromol
39999421,Transition-State-Dependent Spontaneous Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species by Aβ Assemblies Encodes a Self-Regulated Positive Feedback Loop for Aggregate Formation.,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides exhibit distinct biological activities across multiple physical length scales, including monomers, oligomers, and fibrils. The transition from Aβ monomers to pathological aggregates correlates with the emergence of chemical toxicity, which plays a critical role in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the relationship between the physical state of Aβ assemblies and their chemical toxicity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Aβ assemblies can spontaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through transition-state-specific inherent nonenzymatic redox activity. During the transition from initial monomers to intermediate oligomers or condensates to final fibrils, interfacial electrochemical environments emerge and vary at the liquid-liquid and liquid-solid interfaces. Determined by the vibrational Stark effect using electronic pre-resonance stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, the interfacial field of such assemblies is on the order of 10 MV/cm. Interfacial activity, which depends on the Aβ transition state, can modulate the spontaneous oxidation of hydroxide anions, which leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Interestingly, this redox activity modifies the chemical composition of Aβ and establishes a self-regulated positive feedback loop that accelerates aggregation and promotes fibril formation, which represents a new functioning mechanism of Aβ aggregation beyond physical cross-linking. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we identified small molecules capable of disrupting the feedback loop by scavenging hydroxyl radicals or perturbing the interface, thereby inhibiting fibril formation. Our findings provide a nonenzymatic model of neurotoxicity and reveal the critical role of physical interfaces in modulating the chemical dynamics of biomolecular assemblies. These results offer a novel framework for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.",J Am Chem Soc
