Those 2 steps(population interview, clinical evaluation of previously dementia-free subset) have been repeated thereafter at 3-year intervals, withthe fifth wave of data collection in progress at the time of theseanalyses. Beginning in 2001, persons who reached age 65 after theoriginal census were also enrolled.\nAnalyses are based on 2 subsets of the population.

Persons sampled for clinical classifica-\ntion underwent a uniform structured evaluation that included amedical history, complete neurologic examination, detailed cog-nitive performance testing, standard laboratory studies, andbrain MRI in those with cognitive impairment and inconclusiveclinical evidence of stroke. On the basis of this evaluation, anexperienced physician diagnosed dementia and AD using thecriteria of the joint working group of the National Institute ofNeurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke\u2013Alzhei-mer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association.\n16They require\na history of cognitive decline and impairment in at least 2 cogni-tive domains, 1 of which must be memory to meet AD criteria.People who did not meet dementia criteria but had\n                                                     \nCognitive impairment in AD subjects is a risk factor for several cognitive health problems including: cognitive impairments of 1 of the main domains of cognition, including memory impairment, and 1 of the sub-diseases of memory impairment (e.g., amnesia, learning disabilities, and learning disability), cognitive impairment of 2 of the main domains of cognition, including memory impairment, and cognitive impairment of 3 of the sub-diseases of memory impairment.1 This risk factor is in addition to the cognitive impairment in AD.3 The cognitive impairment of AD subjects is a risk factor for a number of cognitive- and behavioral deficits.1,3,4,5,6,7 In addition, the risk of dementia can be associated with other cognitive impairments.6,8,9,10,11,12\nIt is important that these Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.

Because distinguishing prevalent\nand incident MCI is difficult in the Chicago Health and AgingProject, the condition was only examined in secondary analyses.\nAssessment of depressive symptoms. Self-report of depres-\nsive symptoms was assessed in the population interview at 3-yearintervals with a 10-item version\n20of the Center for Epidemio-\nlogic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).21On each item, a brief\nstatement was read and the participant indicated whether he orshe had felt that way much of the past week. The score is thenumber of symptoms reported, ranging from 0 to 10.

Depressive symptoms wereassessed with an informant report version\n25of the Hamilton\nDepression Rating Scale.26Three of the original 17 items were\ndropped: the retardation and agitation items because they re-quire interviewer observation, and the genital symptoms itembecause of the advanced age of the participants. Total score onthe 14-item scale could range from 0 to 42. The scale had goodinternal consistency as evidenced by a Cronbach coefficient\n/H9251of\n0.82 at baseline, and has previously been shown to have goodinterrater reliability.\n14Based \n                                 \nCognitive decline and mortality. In the main analyses, the participants reported their mood changes, self-reports of physical symptoms, and\n22other symptoms of depression, which ranged from mild (1 to 3 items) to severe (16 to 32 items).\nIn the secondary analyses, depressive symptoms were assessed by a self-report of depression using the Hamilton\nDepression Rating Scale. The primary outcome measures were the Depression Severity of Life and Life Satisfaction.\n2\nThe main outcomes were the depression symptom score at baseline (the primary outcome) (the secondary outcome), depression symptoms scores at a time point of\n23average in the two preceding year's months, and depression symptoms scores at the time of the\n18month follow-up.

We analyzed change in depression scores using\ngeneralized estimating equation models27with a logit-link func-\ntion of the proportion of depressive symptoms endorsed andbinomial error structure. The analyses of the incident AD groupestimated annual rate of change in depression score separatelybefore and after the diagnosis of AD. Additional models sepa-rately tested whether race, sex, age, or education modifiedchange before or after the diagnosis and analyzed depression sub-scores. In analyses of the group with annual follow-up, thosewith no cognitive impairment formed a reference group that wascontrasted with MCI and AD groups. The models included aterm for time in years since baseline, indicators for MCI and AD,and the interactions of the indicators with time. The initial anal-ysis used the Hamilton Depression Rat\n                               The first analysis included the covariance matrix of the initial AD group (1, 1, 1), which was used to\nencompass and calculate the average change in the mean score of the initial AD group for the entire follow-up. The covariance matrix was used to predict the cumulative change in the mean score of the initial AD group for the entire follow-up. We used the linear regression model to adjust for the potential for a single-factor model to produce the effect of the initial AD group on the change in the mean score of the AD group. The model did not include covariates that did not change in the original AD group. To examine the potential for an outcome that did change, we used regression models to adjust for the effects of race, sex, education, and age. The results of this analysis were also analyzed using the regression model with the covariance matrix of the initial AD group and the covariance matrix of the AD group.

The findings suggest that AD haslittle systematic effect on depressive symptoms.\nKnowledge about depressive symptoms in AD\ncomes mainly from cross-sectional studies. Thus, indefined populations, persons with MCI, dementia,or AD have generally been found to have more de-pressive symptoms than persons without cognitiveimpairment,\n10,11but these data provide limited in-\nsight into the basis of the association between depres-sion and dementia. We are aware of only 2 previousstudies that tracked depressive symptoms during thedevelopment of AD. One study of older Catholicclergy found no change in self-report of depressivesymptoms (10-item, binary response CES-D) duringa mean of 3.9 years before the incidence of AD and3.2 years before the incidence of MCI.\n12The other\nstudy, like the present one, took place in a definedpopulation and found an increase in self-report ofdepressive symptoms prior to dementia \n                              \n13The authors stated that this study did not demonstrate any effect of AD on depressive symptoms (which is a clear indication of a lack of effect).\nWe also observed that changes in self-report of depression during the first three years of adulthood could be explained by a difference in the level of educational attainment between the groups.\n14However, a recent study shows that AD has no effect on depression symptoms in children and adolescents. The authors of this study found that a reduction in self-report of depression with age was associated with a modest increase in self-report of depressive symptoms in the first year of life.\n15The authors also noted that the association of depression with self-reported depression was not statistically significant in these two studies.\n16The authors reported that the association of depression with measures of self-reported depression was weakly significant in the two studies, but this was not significant in this study.\n17The authors concluded that\n\"These findings provide Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.

This representsan increase of about 0.21 unit per year, which is0.4% of the scale range. By comparison, the averageannual increase before AD was diagnosed in thepresent study was 0.04 unit, which is also 0.4% ofthe scale range. Taken together, therefore, these 3studies are in substantial agreement in suggestingthat very little change in depressive symptoms occursprior to dementia onset in AD.\nThere has been little longitudinal research on de-\npressive symptoms following dementia incidence inAD. In the Religious Orders Study, there was noincrease in self-report of depressive symptoms duringa mean of 2.8 years of observation after AD inci-dence.\n12The present results replicate and extend\nthose findings by showing virtually no change in de-pressive symptoms following dementia onset by in-fo\n                              \n1. This study has found no significant difference in severity between those who reported a diagnosis of dementia with and without AD or those who only reported\n(1) a diagnosis of dementia with or without AD (n = 5) or\n(2) a diagnosis of dementia without AD (n = 4).\n2. There was a difference in the severity of symptoms in the Religious Orders Study (n = 5) after AD (mean = 1.7 units/year, range = 2\u20133 units/year, mean = 0.7\u20130.8 units/year, mean = 0.8\u20130.9 units/year) and among those who reported or did not report dementia.\n3. The present results extend that finding by showing no significant difference in symptoms between those who reported or did not report a diagnosis of dementia with or without AD or those who only reported (1) a diagnosis of dementia with or without AD (n = 5 Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.

That depressive symptoms do not appearto systematically increase in old age\n28,29indicates that\nchronic illness does not invariably depress mood. Inaddition, as AD develops, poor memory and im-paired executive control are likely to disrupt the con-tinuity of mood states and their ability to regulatebehavior. That is, incipient AD may disrupt depres-sive behavior in somewhat the same way that it dis-rupts more adaptive functions. Consistent with thisidea, longitudinal studies of patients with AD identi-fied in medical settings and followed longer than thepresent study suggest that depressive symptoms mayeventually decrease in the disease.\n30,31\nThe relation of depression to the pathologic fea-\ntures of AD has been difficult to establish. In a smallstudy of persons without dementia, depression wasassociated\n                                    \nIn a large, cross-sectional study of the population of\n33,34 patients with AD, depression was associated with, or strongly correlated with, the\n35 most common symptoms of AD. Depression was\n37 the most frequent and common adverse event reported in the study. In-\n38 the longitudinal study, a significant correlation between depression and\n39 symptoms of AD was found, and in the cross-sectional study, the relationship was\n40 even stronger. In addition, the effects of depression on mood.\n41 The authors of the cross-sectional study reported that depression was\n42 more prevalent in the elderly than in younger subjects.\n43 These findings support the hypothesis that depression\n43 may have an impact on mood. In the cross-sectional study, depression in the\n44 population (as measured by the DSM-IV criteria) was found to be\n45 more common in the younger group than in the older group Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.
