This study was one of the largest to date of its kind to examine the risk of dementia among persons who had not previously been diagnosed with dementia. The authors reported a total of 1,931 subjects, of whom 9,851 were enrolled in this study. The majority of the participants included the elderly and those with dementia.

Persons aged 65 years or older were interviewedand a stratified random sample underwent a clinical evaluation.Three years later, the population interview was repeated and a strat-ified random sample of those deemed free of dementia in the initialwave of data collection underwent clinical evaluation. Those 2 steps(population interview, clinical evaluation of previously dementia-free subset) have been repeated thereafter at 3-year intervals, withthe fifth wave of data collection in progress at the time of theseanalyses. Beginning in 2001, persons who reached age 65 after theoriginal census were also enrolled.\nAnalyses are based on 2 subsets of the population. Eligibility\nin the first group required a diagnosis of AD on clinical evalua-tion (see next section) after being dementia-free in an earlierwave of data collection. Of 2,592 individuals invited to par\n                                         \nThe study was conducted on adult residents of theUnited States. All participants were aged 65 years or older, at the time of the initial census, at the time of the first wave of data collection. In addition to the demographic characteristics of the population, the study participants were interviewed in detail by a trained physician and provided demographic information (e.g., age, gender, education level, marital status). This information was used to provide a preliminary assessment of the current state of AD. The primary objective was to establish a baseline of the prevalence of dementia in individuals who were exposed to AD. It was also to provide a baseline for the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the general population. The purpose of the study was to provide a quantitative assessment of the prevalence of AD. The clinical assessment was conducted at the end of the 2-year follow-up period in order to determine whether persons with AD were at risk for the Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.

To analyze change in thesescores, we constructed a generalized estimating equa-tion model that allowed rate of change to vary beforeand after the diagnosis of incident AD.

The Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Metastases (NPD&M) study has shown that the underlying mechanisms underlying the etiological mechanisms of ADHD and depression are not well understood. This is partly due to the wide-ranging nature of the topic. However, it is important to note that the study was not a randomized controlled trial, and any effect of treatment on mood or the brain during the trial may be limited to brief baseline changes during the course of the study.

Thus, indefined populations, persons with MCI, dementia,or AD have generally been found to have more de-pressive symptoms than persons without cognitiveimpairment,\n10,11but these data provide limited in-\nsight into the basis of the association between depres-sion and dementia. We are aware of only 2 previousstudies that tracked depressive symptoms during thedevelopment of AD. One study of older Catholicclergy found no change in self-report of depressivesymptoms (10-item, binary response CES-D) duringa mean of 3.9 years before the incidence of AD and3.2 years before the incidence of MCI.\n12The other\nstudy, like the present one, took place in a definedpopulation and found an increase in self-report ofdepressive symptoms prior to dementia onset.\n13Dur-\ning up to 14 years of observation, there was a meanincrease of about 3 points on the original 20-itemversion of the CES-D, which has 4 response options(scored 0\u20133) and a 0\u201360 score range. This repr\n                                   \n14The second study on AD documented a very little change in symptoms that did not, in fact, include an increase of 1 point.\n15These two studies have three main findings. First, they show that the rate of depression in AD patients is highly correlated to the prevalence of AD. Second, the rates of depression in AD patients are much less than those of AD. Third, AD patients who are older, younger, or with MCI who are more likely to develop depressive symptoms have a much lower risk of developing AD. Fourth, even in the latter three cases, the rates of depression were not significantly different.\n16The fourth study, on AD, also showed a significant inverse relationship between AD and the rate of depression. In the first study, there was no relationship between the rates of depression and the prevalence of AD. In the second, there was no relationship.\n17The fifth study, on AD, showed no relationship Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.

By comparison, the averageannual increase before AD was diagnosed in thepresent study was 0.04 unit, which is also 0.4% ofthe scale range. Taken together, therefore, these 3studies are in substantial agreement in suggestingthat very little change in depressive symptoms occursprior to dementia onset in AD.\nThere has been little longitudinal research on de-\npressive symptoms following dementia incidence inAD. In the Religious Orders Study, there was noincrease in self-report of depressive symptoms duringa mean of 2.8 years of observation after AD inci-dence.\n12The present results replicate and extend\nthose findings by showing virtually no change in de-pressive symptoms following dementia onset by in-formant report or self-report in either AfricanAmerican or white subjects.\n                                   \n13                                      \n14 Given the following section from a research paper, provide a detailed summary of the authors' key findings and conclusions. \n                        Focus on the main results, implications, and conclusions.

Consistent with this idea, de-pressive symptoms have been associated with re-duced density of dendrites and spines in the CA3region of the hippocampus,\n39a characteristic finding\nin animal models of chronic stress.40Understanding\nthe neurobiologic pathways linking depressive symp-toms to cognitive impairment could suggest novelstrategies for delaying symptom onset in dementia.\nThis study has several strengths. Participants were\nsampled from a defined population, making it likelythat a broad spectrum of incident disease was repre-sented and that the findings are generalizable.
